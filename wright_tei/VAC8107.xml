" Sleep on, sleep on! Pale manhood's dreams,&#xD;
Are all of earthly pain or pleasure;&#xD;
Of glory's toils, ambition's schemes&#xD;
Of cherished love, or hoarded treasure.&#xD;
But to the couch where childhood lies,&#xD;
A pure, unmingled trance is given,&#xD;
Lit up by rays from seraph eyes,&#xD;
And glimpses of remembered heaven."&#xD;

IT was one of those lustrous days of March, that beam no&#xD;
where else with so tranquil splendor, as upon the Island&#xD;
and Cape shores of New England. That section of the coast&#xD;
in which our scene opens, thanks to a dawning spirit of pro-&#xD;
gress, had lately received the boon of a public road. This&#xD;
social innovator winding meekly with the sinuous line of the&#xD;
shore, revealed to the traveller a nook of country which, up to&#xD;
this, had nestled a mere by-corner, in the world's great&#xD;
crossings.&#xD;
Ne tr where we stand, the gracious highway crosses a tiny&#xD;
brook. The streamlet is of modest pretensions, but like a&#xD;
pure, unfaltering character, its crystal waters have been the&#xD;
sweet dispenser of many blessings. Among these is the free&#xD;
welcome with which it has ever greeted to its bosom the stroll.&#xD;

&#xD;
ling cattle of the quiet neighborhood. And the tireless cur-&#xD;
rent for the noble use of privileges bestowed, is now receiving&#xD;
the well done of the faithful servant, by being advanced to&#xD;
greater usefulness-; for not unfrequently, the panting beast of&#xD;
some way-worn traveller plunges into the, pebbled ford, and&#xD;
there slakes its thirst in grateful adoration for Nature's boun-&#xD;
tiful gift.&#xD;
Upon the time-worn bridge, under which the gliding rivu-&#xD;
let, like the ceaseless passing of time, was wending itself&#xD;
homeward to the fountain whence it issued, stands in careless&#xD;
attitude, a youth.. He is leaning gently against the slender&#xD;
railing of the arch-way, and gazing with fixed attention upon&#xD;
the running waters below. What invisible power could thus&#xD;
enchain him so long in that position ! Perchance, his eye&#xD;
was first stolen by the speckled trouts in the golden brook&#xD;
below, until musing upon their skittish, motions, Fancy had&#xD;
lured him to her bright realms, where the heart-longings of&#xD;
youth are pictured in the bland hues of Imagination. .Ah,&#xD;
bright Imagination, kindly Divinity, that softly. liftest the&#xD;
leaden curtain of earth, and revealest the universe of the&#xD;
soul! Who would exchange thy airy pinion 'for the iron car&#xD;
of sense ! Who quit thy fairy regions flooded with the beau-&#xD;
ties of a magic creation, for the prosy fields of terrestrial&#xD;
life!&#xD;
But lest too near approach arouse the boy from his reverie,&#xD;
we will while away a moment's interval, by creeping up the&#xD;
brown knoll hard by, and flinging a glance upon the surround-&#xD;
ing prospect.S&#xD;
The scene spread to view, although not graphic, is yet&#xD;
mildly picturesque. Amid here and there homely features,&#xD;
elements may be detected in a subdued form, of deep beauty.&#xD;
specially when swimming in the quivering azure of a golden&#xD;
summer day, the sweet loveliness exuded, loading the breathed&#xD;
&#xD;
SURROUNDING SCENE.8&#xD;
atmosphere, as with fragrance, is in sympathy with the ten-&#xD;
derest emotions of the soul.&#xD;
But let me attempt an outline sketch.&#xD;
The- surface of ground gently variegated, is curiously&#xD;
wreathed with hill, dale, meadow, and lakelet; which are&#xD;
here and there interspersed with coppice, just to relieve the&#xD;
baldness of aspect. On either side of the back-ground, strips&#xD;
of the verdant pine, or of pine interwoven with the more deli-&#xD;
cate oak, stretch embracingly around, at. one point rising&#xD;
toward the dimension of forest; at another, falling off to mazy&#xD;
swamp wood. These woodland arms, stretched wooingly&#xD;
around, hide from view the sharp line of the horizon, except&#xD;
at a single point looking to the South. Here our duteous&#xD;
rivulet, after plodding a long weary way, through swamp&#xD;
woodland and meadow, beside lowly banks, embossed with tan-&#xD;
gled grasses (save where it expands into pebbled fords) untio-&#xD;
gliding by the spot where we stand, it winds and doubles. in&#xD;
serpentine course, through a sedgy marsh, and, at length,&#xD;
stealing through the surf-packed beach, nestles securely in the&#xD;
bosom of mother ocean.&#xD;
Through this inspiring vista, which has gradually widened,&#xD;
to make room for the changing passages of the persevering&#xD;
stream, loom a number of small craft, riding tidily at an&#xD;
chor, in the open bay, the blue waters upon which they sit so&#xD;
jauntily, appearing to rise in the far off horizon, to a greeting&#xD;
with the clouds.&#xD;
Looking more closely, we, observe dotted here and there&#xD;
upon elevated sites of ground, the dwellings of the hardy fish-&#xD;
ermen. These form most of the inhabitants of the settlement.&#xD;
Their lowly abodes are shaped so nearly alike,.*that but for&#xD;
slight differences in size, you could easily believe them to&#xD;
have been run in the same mould. But in respect to color,&#xD;
the contrast they present is striking; for while a few have&#xD;

their shingled outsides bedaubed with pitch stained with red-&#xD;
ochre, after the manner of the Dutch; the rest have been left&#xD;
to take such hue, as off-handed Time, with his elemental paint-&#xD;
brush may have deemed fit to give.&#xD;
In this cursory survey, we have purposely kept in reserve&#xD;
a single residence, -differing immeasurably from  the rest.&#xD;
Indeed, in comparison of size, as well as liberal appropriation&#xD;
of grounds and decorative culture, it swells from them all, in&#xD;
the majestic proportions of some lordly manor. So marked is&#xD;
its superiority, as to arrest strongly the attention. Approach.&#xD;
ing, we find it an imposing quadrangular edifice, presenting&#xD;
here and there a dash toward the architectural. A pretty,&#xD;
quaint portico looks demurely from the south front, and the&#xD;
uniform gable-roof is crowned by a- graceful balustrade.&#xD;
From the rear, stretches languidly an F, one part forming&#xD;
the spacious kitchen, and the other an omnibus for house-hold&#xD;
duties. Crowding near is the cosy granary room, and, apart&#xD;
fromthis, the handsome carriage house.&#xD;
Just across the newly laid out road, which vexatiously runs&#xD;
so near the house, as to intrude on domestic privacy, stands&#xD;
the amply garnered barn. This, so to speak, venerable ser-&#xD;
vant of the mansion, besides being the grateful home of the&#xD;
ever-cared-for farm-stock, has often served as a witching&#xD;
retreat to lure blithe childhood, to the sweet play of hide-go-&#xD;
seek.   J&#xD;
Adjoining this quadruped-home on the East, is the spacious&#xD;
barnyard: its high fence of stakes twined with pine boughs,&#xD;
serving the ever grateful kine, either as shade from the fierce&#xD;
rays of summer, or shelter from the rude blasts of winter.&#xD;
Here, in theseason, cosily hid in some wary tuft, nestles per-&#xD;
chance a love-entranced robin, while her mate, perched near&#xD;
upon a breezy spray, warbles affectionately her golden notes&#xD;
in the gushing sunlight. At the South-west angle of the&#xD;
&#xD;
THE ORCHARD.              5&#xD;
&#xD;
barn, with its sloped top, is the thatched sheep-cote. Upon&#xD;
the peak of its ridge-pole, might sometimes of a scowling win-&#xD;
ter .day, be seen a Jate snow-bird peering through the howling&#xD;
blast. The awry roof when sleeted with snow, has given&#xD;
many a neck or naught slide, from the summit to the greeting&#xD;
snow upon the ground below ; and all with no watchingeye,&#xD;
save the speechless moon careering through the majestic&#xD;
sky.&#xD;
Adjoining the house on the North-west, is a large fruitful&#xD;
orchard. The trees, of great variety, are set with prim exact-&#xD;
ness. A rich esculent garden borders the North side of the&#xD;
orchard enclosure, and so abundant and luscious are the vege-&#xD;
tables it has time out of mind produced, as to have brought&#xD;
high gustatory repute to the mansion table. A numerous&#xD;
band of relatives have been wont to look with an eye of com-&#xD;
mon inheritance to the earliest greenings of the kitchen gar-&#xD;
den; and many a lone, poverty-pressed bosom, has throbbed&#xD;
with pulsations of grateful joy, as a sharer of the timely&#xD;
bounty it has unobtrusively dispensed.&#xD;
The orchard is thus bounded : At the south-side lies the&#xD;
public road, and too public by far in the tempting season of&#xD;
fruit-ripening. The coy little rivulet already named, creeps&#xD;
noiselessly by the grassy border of the West side. On the&#xD;
North, the tall, dark pines rear their mighty heads, and seem&#xD;
to look haughtily down upon their less pretentious, but more&#xD;
productive neighbors. While an umbrageous lane steals&#xD;
moodily along by the East side, as if touched with remorse&#xD;
for conveying lustful feet so near the forbidden enclosure.&#xD;
The entire orchard is surrounded by rows of once waving&#xD;
shade trees, poplar, balm-gilead, and such short-lived species,&#xD;
but now so far in their wane, as to stand the merest hulks of&#xD;
former majesty. Yet, like benignant humanity, never past&#xD;
being useful, they have opened their bosoms to the sharp&#xD;

THE MANSiON.                7&#xD;
&#xD;
wood-pecker, and kindred birds, which nestle their young&#xD;
securely adown their hollow trunks.&#xD;
Martin boxes, pretty miniature houses, are here and there&#xD;
perched upon the ridges of the out-buildings, or stand airily&#xD;
upon poles planted in the ground. Around these, the martin,&#xD;
swallow, blue-bird, and other graces of the feathered tribe,&#xD;
sail and twitter in the season, overflowing with gladness, at&#xD;
the wealth of natureoand art, evoked for their joy.&#xD;
This having thrown a glance about the surroundings, if&#xD;
the. indulgent reader will venture with me, we will pass at&#xD;
once through the neat front yard, up the time-worn steps of&#xD;
the portico, and lay hand upon the latch of the front door.&#xD;
The handle of brass is 'chased, and below is a massive brass&#xD;
knocker. The frank portal yields responsive to our touch,&#xD;
displaying a broad hall through which we wend into the broad&#xD;
kitchen. A turn up the back stair-way, we come to an am-&#xD;
biguous defile, whence winding up another flight of stairs, we&#xD;
are ushered into the womb-like attic. Placing foot upon the&#xD;
open steps leading to the roof, and throwing over with one&#xD;
hand the scuttle, a spring fetches us panting from tire upon&#xD;
the platform of the "Look-out." Instantly, we feel the tonic&#xD;
air of heaven a-glow upon our spirits. The wide, varied&#xD;
landscape unrolls beneath our ken, ushering upon the sense a&#xD;
sweet and inspiring charm. And, as our eye turns toward&#xD;
the South, it falls with a sublime thrill, upon the rolling,&#xD;
reaching bay, flecked with its white winged carriers of&#xD;
plenty.&#xD;
The Look-out is the favorite resort of all. It serves to&#xD;
relieve the monotony of domestic life ; to give varied zest to&#xD;
happy visitors at the mansio.; to sooth the wistful heart of&#xD;
neighbors. Here, the stealthy foot of childhood is wont to&#xD;
flee, to enjoy the purloined morsel; here mutual longing&#xD;
&#xD;
youth have sometimes hied to breathe beneath the sailing&#xD;
moon, the rosy flame of love. But more tender still, is when&#xD;
some deep-hearted wife with tearful eye and heaving breast,&#xD;
clings with last fading look to the vanishing speck of the cruel&#xD;
vessel, bearing away, alas, perhaps forever, her life compan-&#xD;
ion. Or with joy and gratitude too full for utterance, she&#xD;
hovers around b er roseate brood of little ones, all watching&#xD;
with beseeching, expectant gaze, the dear, winged angel bear-&#xD;
ing to their arms their all of life.&#xD;
Thus was the mansion like a city set upon a hill. Nor did&#xD;
it loom less hugely upon the vision of the neighboring fisher-&#xD;
men because standing in so marked contrast to their own&#xD;
shrubless homes. ' Indeed, it seemed to have absorbed to itself&#xD;
the thrift, the rural beauty of the settlement. Even the in-&#xD;
mates had accorded them a social preeminence verging upon&#xD;
veneration. And all eyes were wont to turn toward the glo-&#xD;
rious mansion with that sentiment of homage we instinctively&#xD;
feel for superiority.&#xD;
The regal soul that conceived and gave the breath of life to&#xD;
this wonderful home, I can but vaguely limn. Regretfully,&#xD;
to me, his rounded life swells up to my memory only in shad-&#xD;
owy cognizance. I have seen him only through the mouth-&#xD;
piece of tradition; or more really in the sublime energy of his&#xD;
works.&#xD;
I know, however, that gracious Fortune exalted him to&#xD;
three happy, fruitful marriages. His last consort -a notable&#xD;
coincidence -had herself been twice married, and both times&#xD;
received the boon of children. But her star did not cease its&#xD;
propitious beams here. She continued multiplying her loves&#xD;
honoring the sweet law of nature, that noble exercise but&#xD;
blesses the benignant power of giving.&#xD;
Thus, their welded souls- baptized in a nuptial flame, that&#xD;
grew brighter with age, they stood out the fountain-head and&#xD;

INFLUENCE OF WEALTH.            9&#xD;
&#xD;
representatives of a very numerous family. But the connubial&#xD;
fire did not scorch within their breast,the glow of active sym-&#xD;
pathy. On the contrary, the affection for offspring flowed&#xD;
copiously adown thefamily stream, and, after laying generous&#xD;
bosoms, came back impregnated with filial love, to well out to&#xD;
amplest grace, the life of the parental pair.&#xD;
The loyal head of the patriarchal couple has long since&#xD;
been gathered to the realms of the future, but his sublunary&#xD;
life still flows as pure as the purling brook amid his broad&#xD;
acres. As fragrant yet blooms his spirit, as did once the sweet&#xD;
blossoms of his favorite orchard. And his memory continues&#xD;
to shoot as green as the mantling grass upon the turfy grave&#xD;
that hides his endeared form from mortal eye, Indeed, how&#xD;
little of the truly great can ever die. Such leave behind&#xD;
them a stream of light that broadens in descending the vista&#xD;
of years.&#xD;
Souls there are, upon which the influences of life act like&#xD;
genial breath, that swells to comeliness the ductile glass. The&#xD;
gentleman of the manor was largely one of these. Offspring&#xD;
did not narrow, but amplified his being. Parental affection&#xD;
dried not up, but deepened the lake-water of his existence.&#xD;
His family sympathies were not weakened by being multi-&#xD;
plied, but strengthened and expanded rather, broad like the-&#xD;
vaulted sky, that shuts down in limited vision upon the&#xD;
standing observer, but lifts its arched curtain to him who&#xD;
actively moves.&#xD;
His noble character shone brightly in every light, but in&#xD;
none more amiably than in the deep interest he showed for&#xD;
his children. This continued unabated, even after their ma-&#xD;
jority. It is a remembered remark of his, that he wished a&#xD;
dwelling sufficiently spacious for all his family, where they&#xD;
might abide in continued love and friendship.&#xD;
Wedded love ! Divinest flower of earth! Purest image&#xD;
&#xD;
of heaven ! Thy magic touch transforms the soul, and awak-&#xD;
ens illimitable longings to bless !&#xD;
Fortune is diverse in its influence upon' character. To&#xD;
many it proves a fatal embrace, dwarfing the intellect, blunt-&#xD;
ing the moral sense, and blighting the affections. Such are&#xD;
gradually drawn closer and closer within the coils of the mon-&#xD;
ster Mammon, until:the native lustre of their souls is crushed&#xD;
within them.&#xD;
Yet to some, wealth is but the golden wand of genius. It&#xD;
breaks forth the outward substance of an inner power, the&#xD;
material expression of an affluent soul. It is the tangible&#xD;
of a spiritual creativeness, and its reflux is to expand and&#xD;
liberalize.&#xD;
Such turn their riches to good, if but to satisfy the cravings&#xD;
of a noble nature. Their instincts lead them to give bright&#xD;
vesture to their ideals. These are the noblemen in the king-&#xD;
dom of Success. I need not say that Mr. Damon, the creator&#xD;
of the mansion described, belonged to this class.&#xD;
Here in this dewy lap of Nature was cradled the child&#xD;
which takes the leading part in our, tale. What spot more&#xD;
genial for the budding of an ingenious soul! Away from the&#xD;
festering marts of trade, adown the quietude of the country!&#xD;
The landscape grows pictured in the heart. The atmosphere&#xD;
flows with melody. Life distils with dewy gentleness. The&#xD;
seasons roll with softest harmony. The social hearth-stone&#xD;
cricket, the spring-greeting frog, the meek, grateful kine, the&#xD;
garrulous domestic fowls, the gleeful swallow, the frisking&#xD;
lamb, the choral songsters, and the wave-lashed shore with its&#xD;
plaintive resonance, were so many voices of Nature, attuning&#xD;
the soul to tender concord, and throwing a silvery veil of&#xD;
incense over life that no grim fortune shall ever quite dispel.&#xD;
Ah, halcyon childhood ! where all glows with the roseate&#xD;
hues of the heart; where all is sweet with the balmiest fra-&#xD;

grance ; where all wafts the mildest zephyrs laden with the&#xD;
richest melody. Thou first heaven ! Alas, that thy bright&#xD;
illusion should ever be dissolved by the touch of sordid life,&#xD;
like a delicious dream dispelled by the pattering of a-rainy&#xD;
morn. .Oh, could we but extend thy empire, of innocence and&#xD;
beauty over ripe manhood and tottering age, how blessed for&#xD;
the world!&#xD;
Peace to childhood ! Disturb not its golden dream! Scat-&#xD;
ter rather more profusely in its path-way the roses of inno-&#xD;
cent joy.&#xD;
How much of the good of life depends upon the seeds sown&#xD;
in infancy ! How much of its happiness is but the blossoming&#xD;
of an early nurture. Then guard well the footsteps of youth.&#xD;
Let it be the period for the ingrowing of that purity which no&#xD;
rubbing of after life shall obliterate.&#xD;
Thus ruminating, our eye returns to the figure still motion-&#xD;
less upon the bridge. But while revolving upon the won-&#xD;
drous power that could so arrest the ceaseless faculties of&#xD;
youth; of a sudden, as if electrified by a daring thought, the&#xD;
boy rouses with a spring, wheels around, and bounds off in the&#xD;
direction of the mansion, with a step so elate, as to denote the&#xD;
ending of an inward struggle, in which mastery has imparted&#xD;
new-born vigor to the spirit.&#xD;
The sudden turn of the boy afforded but a glance to catch&#xD;
his portrait. But the outline rayed forth was distinct and&#xD;
vivid. He seemed rather large for one of his age, with exu-&#xD;
berant raven hair, high, expansive forehead, dark, beaming&#xD;
eyes, but soft features ; fair skin, slightly bronzed in the sun.&#xD;
He might not be called beautiful, yet there was something so&#xD;
free and open in aspect, and so gentle and lofty in mien, as to&#xD;
inspire you with lively interest.&#xD;
His dress was slightly unique, not from lack of neatness, for&#xD;
it bore a prim air, and was here and there decorated. But&#xD;

YEARNING FOR THE SEA.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER II.&#xD;
&#xD;
In this wide world, the fondest and the best&#xD;
Are the most uried, most troubled and distessed,.&#xD;
CIIABBE.&#xD;
&#xD;
IT is sombre night. A black curtain palls the heavens ;&#xD;
and the lugubrious wind, after moaning through the forest of&#xD;
tall pines near, sets up a sharper wail around the corners of&#xD;
the mansion, which it rocks with the frenzy of implacable&#xD;
grief.&#xD;
In a front room, upon the second floor, near the fire which&#xD;
is jetting out and crackling upon the ample hearth, sits a&#xD;
woman, and by her on a lowly stool, is seated a lad. He is&#xD;
reclining his head upon her lap, while she moves at times her&#xD;
sympathetic fingers through the dark hair crowning so luxuri-&#xD;
antly his fair brow. Mute have they been for moments,&#xD;
hushed evidently by the sounding gloom without. But what&#xD;
different emotions in each the lorn scene awakens ! In the&#xD;
boy, it firs up resolutions strong for the future ; while to the&#xD;
woman, the shrieking wind is but the requiem of shrouded&#xD;
hopes! The candle has just darted up its dying flicker, yet a&#xD;
bright, though fitful flame is still upon the hearth. As the&#xD;
glancing light falls upon the mother's face, brightening her&#xD;
bold, yet expressive features, now furrowed with care and suf.-&#xD;
fering, you almost seem to have before you the very image of&#xD;
grief.--                           ,&#xD;
"Mother," at length broke the youth in a cautious tone.&#xD;
" Well, Walter," was the mild response.&#xD;
A pause followed, for the boy involuntarily trembled,- in&#xD;

F&#xD;

&#xD;
view of the pang he felt sure his request would inflict. But&#xD;
gathering resolution, he continued. "Mother I must go to&#xD;
sea."&#xD;
As these words fell from his lips, the fingers of the woman&#xD;
involuntarily clutched the locks they were toying, and a con-&#xD;
vulsive tremor' ran through her frame.&#xD;
"Oh, Walter ! my son! how could you thus pierce anew&#xD;
my heart;&#xD;
" It troubles me," dear mother, that you feel so bad about&#xD;
it," said the boy, "but you must let me go ; I've thought it&#xD;
well over, and am resolved.&#xD;
"No, Walter, never ; I can never consent to it, never. Oh,&#xD;
my son, how could you think of such a step !"&#xD;
The tone of anguish accompanying these words brought a&#xD;
gush of commiseration to the breast of the boy. For a mo-&#xD;
ment, he recoiled from his purpose. He regretted in his&#xD;
heart, having broached the subject to his mother. But now&#xD;
committed, the under-current of a cherished wish swept him&#xD;
on.&#xD;
A moment's pause, and he continued in a more. conciliatory&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
" As much as I love you, mother, and however painful the&#xD;
thought of leaving home, still I must go, at some time. There&#xD;
is nothing.-here, that I can engage in for a livelihood. Others&#xD;
younger even than I are off, doing well. And to confess, I'm&#xD;
quite tired of this butterfly-life, I'm leading. I pine for&#xD;
action of some sort. I burn to plunge into the great ocean of&#xD;
life, and see what the world is made of. Fairly away, and&#xD;
I'd arrive at something, one day. Besides," he added, in a&#xD;
more sympathizing tone, "I can't be idle longer, and see&#xD;
you struggle so hard to support us. I long to help ease your&#xD;
hard lot, and do something in return for all you've done for-&#xD;
me. Let me go, mother, and I'll soon earn money to build a&#xD;

nice cottage, when we shall be no longer-dependent upon oth-&#xD;
ers for a shelter."&#xD;
He' now met his mother's eye, with the hope of finding&#xD;
there a softened expression; but the same distressed look held&#xD;
possession of her grief-stricken features. A deep sigh was at&#xD;
first her only response. At length she exclaimed in accents&#xD;
of wild sorrow, " Go, I suppose you must, from me at some&#xD;
day, but never upon the sea. Its treacherous waves have&#xD;
already robbed me nearly of my all. They shall not take my&#xD;
only remaining hope.&#xD;
"The bones of your grandfather and of three of your uncles,"&#xD;
she- continued, with deeper pathos, "are soaking in the restless&#xD;
ocean, their precious flesh, food for voracious fishes. Your&#xD;
own beloved father," and here the bereaved mother seemed&#xD;
struggling with overmastering emotions, "was drowned in very&#xD;
sight of our home. Just as his fond anticipations of return&#xD;
were on the point of being realized, when his heart was leap-&#xD;
ing to fold you for the first time to his breast, the relentless&#xD;
waves drew him beneath their lid forever.&#xD;
"They hal joyously told me of his coming, and then, when&#xD;
my feeble heart was overflowing with gladness to feel so soon&#xD;
his endeared presence, they, the unfeeling men ! set down his&#xD;
pallid corse at my bed-side, as if in very mockery of my hap-&#xD;
piness.&#xD;
" Oh speak not to me of the sea. Its very name is hideous,&#xD;
its memory a curse !"&#xD;
The heart-stricken widow covered her face with her hands,&#xD;
overcome by the up-heavings of bitter memories. Yet, like a&#xD;
deep;moving shadow, the darkness was but momentary. Re-&#xD;
gaining her wonted serenity, she continued.&#xD;
"You spake, my son, of aid in my toilsome path for daily&#xD;
bread. - Sweet to me is this token of filial love. I seize it&#xD;
gratefully, as a fragrant flower of your blossoming heart. To&#xD;
&#xD;
advance your worldly prospects, any hardship would I under-&#xD;
go; but for myself, fortune has no longer a charm. Bereaved&#xD;
of those who gave joy to earthly possessions, I feel no longer&#xD;
an interest in this world, save in you. I will consent to what-&#xD;
ever may promise for your advantage, except going to sea.&#xD;
But speak never again of that."&#xD;
These last words struck the boy down-cast. For several&#xD;
moments he remained thoughtfully silent. At length in a de-&#xD;
sponding tone he asked:&#xD;
"But, dear mother, what can I do for a livelihood, if not&#xD;
go to sea ?'&#xD;
Mrs. Carl quickly responded, her face brightening with&#xD;
hope.&#xD;
"I wish you, my son, to be a merchant. It is a fine&#xD;
career."&#xD;
" But how am I to get a place to begin with," inquired the&#xD;
boy in a doubting voice.&#xD;
" I have thought of Mr. Williams," replied Mrs. Carl. "He&#xD;
has been very successful in trade. He is a nice man. We&#xD;
were intimate associates in early life. He always inquires&#xD;
about you with marked kindness, when he comes down from&#xD;
the city. Besides, you know, we are related to the family.&#xD;
We have only to mention it to him, and I feel sure he will&#xD;
take you at once."&#xD;
"Think never of such a thing," replied the boy, with spirit.&#xD;
"I know the Williamses are rich, but how often have I been&#xD;
told, that their inheritance should of right have been shared&#xD;
with us. Can we ask a favor of these people, who are living&#xD;
at ease upon possessions belonging in justice to us, as well,&#xD;
who seeing our hard life continually before them, have only&#xD;
smooth words to offer as consolation ? If I must beg, let it be&#xD;
done of strangers, not of these dignified relatives, whose very&#xD;
smiles freeze up my better feelings. True, they always show&#xD;

&#xD;
toward me a kindly manner, but it is mingled with such an air&#xD;
of condescension, as to leave no agreeable feeling. And if a&#xD;
person of greater pretensions happens present, I am made to&#xD;
feel an inferiority deeply mortifying. Indeed, the Williamses&#xD;
with all their amiable nature, seem ever occupied with two&#xD;
leading thoughts ; namely, to magnify themselves in the eyes&#xD;
of those in stations below them, or to raise themselves in the&#xD;
favor of such as occupy higher positions in society. One thing&#xD;
is certain; they are not pleased to have poor relations hang-&#xD;
ing about them; and for one I mean to take good care not to&#xD;
stand in their way. Why, only yesterday I got a line from&#xD;
Harriet Williams, saying, I would please use with care the&#xD;
school-history she had loaned you for me. How this twinged&#xD;
me! I was believing all the time, that you had bought the&#xD;
"book. Such a message ! and from a girl! and one of my age !&#xD;
The furies take the contemptible volume ! I could have scat-&#xD;
tered its leaves to the four winds of heaven.&#xD;
"But suppose Mr. Williams out of pity for you, should take&#xD;
me with him, what but an underling of charity should I be,&#xD;
ever carrying about me a sore feeling of dependence. You&#xD;
know I've not the learning to bring me forward, and upon&#xD;
what friendly arm could I rely to hoist me into a favorable&#xD;
situation. Besides, we have no money to set me up in busi-&#xD;
ness, after serving out my time~ as clerk. Then I ~know I&#xD;
should become thoroughly tired of so much confinement.&#xD;
- Lawrence, who has been with Messrs. Perry &amp;amp; Bumstead now&#xD;
these four years, told me the other day very frankly, that all&#xD;
is not so bright in a merchant's life, as it would seem to be.&#xD;
That the employment, however dazzling at a distance, is, in,&#xD;
reality, wearisome and full of vexation; and that he. has&#xD;
fished himself over and over again back upon the homestead&#xD;
farm of his father. The other day, I overheard old Mr.&#xD;
Hawes, whose opinion you think so highly of, telling some of&#xD;
&#xD;
II&#xD;
&#xD;
his neighbors, that mercantile life is the very worst they can&#xD;
think of for their sons -that not one in ten succeeds; that his&#xD;
own prosperous fortune was more owing to good luck, than&#xD;
anything else -that there are a thousand snares in the city to&#xD;
entrap the young and unwary   that such protracted in-door&#xD;
life is injurious, if not ruinous to health --- and that the unva-&#xD;
ried round of a shop-keeper's duties is calculated to dwarf the&#xD;
body, and narrow the mind. But if permitted to launch upon&#xD;
some pursuit where success depends rather upon the energy&#xD;
of one's own free arm, than upon chance or a hateful favorit-&#xD;
ism, I feel sure of making my way.&#xD;
"As for-Mr.-Williams, if he really wanted my services, or&#xD;
wished to be generous enough to extend us his aid, why not&#xD;
proffer me of himself an invitation. He must see how needy&#xD;
we are, and he's not the thoughtless person to require being&#xD;
reminded of a trivial duty. The 'plain conclusion is, that he&#xD;
is averse to having connected with him even in business one&#xD;
who might embarrass him in his social relations. Now, the&#xD;
simplest impulse of manliness forbids that I should thrust&#xD;
myself upon him. Any choice would be preferable."&#xD;
Mrs. Carl poignantly felt the force of these objections. For&#xD;
she had frequently of late hinted to Mr. Williams in every&#xD;
way a delicate self-respect would allow, her choice of an occu-&#xD;
pation for her son; and how grateful she would be for assist-&#xD;
ance in advancing her wishes. But he always maintained an&#xD;
imperturbable silence, or adroitly turned the subject. She&#xD;
could not at the time conclude the merchant averse to receiv-&#xD;
ing her son, so superior in her own eyes, but the arguments&#xD;
of her boy now placed the probability beyond a doubt. With&#xD;
hopes so desperate, what could she offer in response!&#xD;
Bitter poverty, how remorseless thy fang ! To a sensitive&#xD;
nature, how hard the alternative of asking a favor of an early&#xD;
associate now lifted to wealth, and flushed with pride !&#xD;

HOMESTEAD LIFE.             19&#xD;
&#xD;
A long pause followed. It was broken only bythe mad-&#xD;
dened rain against the trembling'mansion, or the sobbing wind&#xD;
around its wide-spread angles.&#xD;
A silence there is more articulate'than the voice of tongues.&#xD;
It is when the soul sends up from its depths, the convictions&#xD;
sealed there by the fire-of nature. Amid the conflicting emo-&#xD;
tions heaving the widow's heart, the wringing truth was forced&#xD;
to her mind that further opposition to the resolution of her&#xD;
son, were a vain effort. But we are wont to cling to cherished&#xD;
hopes with a hero's trust, and the grasp of. a martyr.&#xD;
"Well," at length resumed Mrs. Carl in a dejected, but&#xD;
calm tone, "I must, I suppose, see your uncle Damon."&#xD;
"Uncle Damon, and for what?" quickly asked the boy.&#xD;
"-To see if he will take you with him upon the farm, since&#xD;
you are so set against trying your fortune in trade," replied&#xD;
the mother in a still equable, but slightly ironical tone ; at&#xD;
the same time watching the countenance of her son, for once&#xD;
since their conversation commenced.&#xD;
"Why, mother, I am sure you cannot be in earnest. I&#xD;
know you better than to think you would have me yoked with&#xD;
Uncle Damon upon the old homestead, dragging along a weary&#xD;
life of toil, a slave to a host of greedy relatives, and in condi-&#xD;
tion a little above the oxen in the stall -a life with nothing to&#xD;
gladden the present, nor to afford hope for the future."&#xD;
The vehement tone in which these sentences were uttered,&#xD;
arrested the current of Mrs. Carl's remarks. For she did not&#xD;
seriously meditate placing her son in so thriftless a situation,&#xD;
as upon the farm, and her sincerity would not allow of trifling&#xD;
with her boy's feelings.._&#xD;
Mi. Damon jr., it may be observed, was the eldest son of his&#xD;
mother with her last husband. On the death of Mr. Damon,&#xD;
senior, the management of the home seemed all naturally to&#xD;
devolve upon this son. It was accordingly arranged that he&#xD;
&#xD;
should have the occupancy of the homestead, and the improve-&#xD;
ment of the widow's third of the estate, as compensation for&#xD;
assuming her maintenance. But however noble this might&#xD;
be, as a filial duty, it proved in a pecuniary point of view .a&#xD;
hard bargain. For the entire products of the sterile acres,&#xD;
were at most inconsiderable. While the cost of keeping up&#xD;
the place, bore as an onerous tax. Then there was the unin-&#xD;
terrupted drain from the fleecings of a numerous family, who&#xD;
seemed as inexorable, as the locusts of old.&#xD;
Mrs. Damon, as before observed, was blessed as falls to the&#xD;
lot of few mortals. Her own children, together with those of&#xD;
her late husband from his previous marriages, made up a fam-&#xD;
ily of rare amplitude. Indeed, she was the centre of a paren-&#xD;
tal flock to remind you of the palmy days of the patriarchs.&#xD;
The venerable grandmother possessed a warm and gener-&#xD;
ous nature. Connubial happiness and numerous offspring had&#xD;
deepened and enlarged her sympathies. Time had softened&#xD;
the asperities of life, and mellowed her character to great rich-&#xD;
-ness. She seemed now a sun, beaming alike upon all. Hon-&#xD;
ored and beloved by young and old, the going down of her life&#xD;
was as serene and glorious, as the most beautiful autumnal&#xD;
sunset.&#xD;
Animated by the purest fealty to the sentiments of her hus-&#xD;
band, she continued cherishing the family friendship, he so&#xD;
nobly fostered in his life time. But these maternal indulgences&#xD;
at length widened off into abuse. From receiving the favors&#xD;
as a gracious gift, they came in the end to look upon it, as&#xD;
their born right to visit the mansion-and partake of its gener-&#xD;
ous hospitalities at pleasure. Thus rarely beamed a fair&#xD;
afternoon, without seeing at the homestead a throng of merry&#xD;
relatives. These maternal parties naturally ended with an&#xD;
abundant supper. Then followed in course the stuffing of-&#xD;
aunts' workbags, in which were quietly wont to disappear cake,&#xD;

doughnuts, and like delicacies of the table, for the sweet tooth&#xD;
of little ones left at home. And such of the company as were&#xD;
unprovided with these articles of their own, must have a bas-&#xD;
ket of apples, a pitcher of milk, or a batch of Uncle Damon's&#xD;
excellent vegetables ; while each would take a little, "just for&#xD;
a taste," of grandmother's new butter, so very nice.&#xD;
Now, these gracious kindred, did not realize that constant&#xD;
drippings will wear away a stone, that many a little makes a&#xD;
mickle, that these pet favors, though delightful to receive, im-&#xD;
posed in their supply a burden toilsome to be borne. The&#xD;
truth is, children of .older growth, they had been spoiled by&#xD;
over indulgence. Always receiving, but doing nothing in&#xD;
return, had gradually wrought within them a degree of compla-&#xD;
cent selfishness, that rendered them quite callous to sympathy.&#xD;
As for Mr. Damon, he bore it all with heroic resignation.&#xD;
His was not a'soul to falter on account of trivial vexations.&#xD;
His indefatigable spirit imbued with the disinterestedness of a&#xD;
noble example, had welded habit to sentiment in an unwaver-&#xD;
ing path of self-sacrifice. Still, at times, his fortitude seemed&#xD;
about giving way. Qualities are transmissible, but not gen-&#xD;
ius. Mr. Damon inherited the patient endurance of his father,&#xD;
but not the old gentleman's resources of mind. Thus the&#xD;
weight of keeping up the establishment bore indeed heavily&#xD;
upon him.&#xD;
But the numerous sharers in the sweets of his untiring&#xD;
exertions, had no- manly eye to perceive this. A  slight&#xD;
change on their part, a course of generous cooperation, in&#xD;
lieu of eternal filching, would have lightened his weight. But&#xD;
no, Mr. Damon might struggle on, until sunk beneath the wave&#xD;
of despondency, for aught they cared, so long as their stream&#xD;
of good things continued in uninterrupted flow. Curse on&#xD;
the craven spirit that can see a brave soul struggle on for&#xD;
another's good, with no heart in the beneficiary to share the&#xD;
unrequited toil.&#xD;
&#xD;
Well, in time, Mr. Damon himself followed the way of the&#xD;
world, and took-to him a wife. She was the very pink of the&#xD;
neighborhood, fair as a lily and sweet as a morning rose.&#xD;
How she could ever come to look with complacency on the&#xD;
swart features of the wiry visaged farmer, seemed marvel-&#xD;
lous. But, perhaps, his earnest and truthful life touched a&#xD;
sympathetic chord in her breast. For the female heart,&#xD;
though robed in earth's divinest beauty, is not always mere&#xD;
vanity. It is not always to be lured by the falsehood of show.&#xD;
It craves often nobler aliment than the lure of sense. It, not&#xD;
unfrequently, can pierce the fair fading form without, into the&#xD;
vital enduring qualities within; and, sometimes, with a sub-&#xD;
lime energy inborn, rise superior to the false conceits of&#xD;
society, and preferring rather to stake its happiness upon&#xD;
honest manly worth, than embrace fair, deceptive appearance.&#xD;
This blissful event would, it was thought, reform the abuses&#xD;
at the mansion. But -it did not. They were rather aggra-&#xD;
vated by it. For each relative in turn had very naturally to&#xD;
make a courteous call upon the new bride. This opened the&#xD;
way for longer visits. By this time, the ancient freedom was&#xD;
reestablished. The young wife very naturally desired the&#xD;
good will of all her husband's friends, and she chanced more-&#xD;
over to be one of those amiable beings, who will submit to any&#xD;
sacrifice rather than risk giving offence. She buckled to with&#xD;
affectionate heart, to share lovingly her husband's burdens.&#xD;
But the more fruitful their exertions, the more freely thronged&#xD;
the good folks. They swarmed like bees to a banquet of&#xD;
honey.&#xD;
Erewhile rosy-fingered Time handed them golden-haired&#xD;
nestlings of their own. This sweetened their labors, but only&#xD;
increased the pressing burden of their lot. They strove on&#xD;
with waning strength, until exhausted nature gave way, and&#xD;
left them, a strand upon the shores of life.&#xD;

DIREFUL FOREBODINGS.          23&#xD;
&#xD;
Truth is stranger than fiction. This devoted couple sunk&#xD;
to a premature death, the victims of over-worked energies.&#xD;
Now, Mrs. Carl from her needy situation had shared her-&#xD;
self too freely of the generous'exertions of Uncle Damon, not&#xD;
to perceive the blight it would cast upon her son's prospects,&#xD;
to doom the boy to an eternal round of ill-requited labor upon&#xD;
the homestead.&#xD;
Arrested by the force of this conviction, she hesitated long&#xD;
before replying. At length, with a saddened brow, she&#xD;
resumed.&#xD;
"I can propose but one thing more ; It*is that you go to&#xD;
live with your grandfather Walfinch. He rarely notices chil-&#xD;
dren, but he has always shown marked interest in you. When&#xD;
an infant, he even asked that you might receive his name, in-&#xD;
timating that I should never regret the favor. But previously,&#xD;
your father and his brother, carried away with a novel, had&#xD;
mutually promised that to whichever heaven vouchsafed a&#xD;
son, he should take the name of the hero. You proved the&#xD;
first blessing, and my dear husband was not the man to recede&#xD;
from his pledge. Your grandfather seemed to feel the slight,&#xD;
but it did not alienate his tender regard for you. He took a&#xD;
lively interest in your visits to his house, and seemed delighted&#xD;
to have you constantly in his society."&#xD;
"Yet I never feel happy with grandfather," replied Walter.&#xD;
He is so very' positive, has such. an iron will, by which he&#xD;
would bend everybody to his own way of thinking. Then he&#xD;
so worships money. With him, all is looked at through gain.&#xD;
I am sure he could never understand my feelings. Indeed, it&#xD;
seems to plague him badly, that we are so poor, yet he always&#xD;
awaits our asking for whatever we must, just as if begging&#xD;
were a pleasure. Why, the room we live in, and the fire&#xD;
that warms us, are grandfather's. Are we always to live in&#xD;
such a state of dependency? If it must be your lot, pray let&#xD;
&#xD;
it not be mine. Let me get away, and, for once, breathe the&#xD;
air of freedom."&#xD;
The earnest tone of his words convinced Mrs. Carl, that&#xD;
beneath the sunny temper of her son, there lay a purpose, in&#xD;
vain now to combat.&#xD;
Argument was over. Hope even sank below the horizon,&#xD;
of faith. With forehead fallen upon her hand, she seemed&#xD;
fixed in a stupor of despair.&#xD;
It was now near midnight, and Walter having tenderly im-&#xD;
printed a good night kiss upon the motionless lips of his&#xD;
mother, retired for sleep.&#xD;
At length, arousing, and finding herself alone, the widow&#xD;
knelt gently upon the painted floor of the room, and yielded&#xD;
to fervent prayer. Yet no words were uttered, no sounds&#xD;
were audible. The emotions within were too intense for&#xD;
mere outward expression.&#xD;
Thus calmed in spirit, she crawled into her humble bed.&#xD;
But the tempest still raging without, sent a chill of despondency&#xD;
to her soul. In{a state of mind half frantic with despair, she&#xD;
pondered sadly upon the prospects of her son, but no angel-&#xD;
hope came to her relief. Imagination deeply aroused, only&#xD;
conjured up wild horrors of the deep. Over these, she brooded&#xD;
with excited feelings, until her soul trembled on the verge of&#xD;
delirium. When, after spent agony, her weary lids closed in&#xD;
a quietude of spirit approaching slumber, phantoms of the&#xD;
watery deep would rise in direful images to her startled brain.&#xD;
Now, she seemed cast with her son upon the angry ocean.&#xD;
The tremulous barque, goaded by the ferocious wind and ire-&#xD;
ful lightning, leaps madly over the remorseless waves.&#xD;
Again, she is clasping her loved boy upon a drifting frag-&#xD;
ment of wreck, forlorn cast-a-ways upon the wide waters, cut&#xD;
off from the world of life, with no kindred tear to soothe, nor&#xD;
human arm to rescue. The relentless waves dash angrily&#xD;

against their frail refuge. The lurid sky yawns in mockery&#xD;
or knits its brow in dread defiance. A sea gull sails over&#xD;
them, flaps its broad wings, sends up a piercing scream, and.&#xD;
then soars off in wild majesty!&#xD;
Then, again betrayed by the treacherous element, they sink&#xD;
down, down, the watery caverns of the mighty deep. Scaly&#xD;
fishes or begrimmed monsters dart fitfully around, awaiting a&#xD;
dainty carnival. Something clutches at her feet; she startles&#xD;
with afright, and is relieved to find herself in her own bed!&#xD;
But the paroxysms of the soul are happily brief. Their&#xD;
very intensity sears up the glowing lava of emotion, and&#xD;
arrests its seething ow.&#xD;
The fierce storm without at length ceased, and the tumul-&#xD;
tuous spirit of the widow, as if beating in unison with nature,&#xD;
had, likewise, calmed.&#xD;
As she awoke in the morning, the golden rays of the rising&#xD;
sun were just beaming through the eastern window ,of the&#xD;
chamber, and all the more sweetly from the rage of the previ-&#xD;
ous -night. The tearful earth, as if repentant of the elemental&#xD;
warfare, was distributing the showery light with prismatic&#xD;
glory.-&#xD;
The depressed widow resumed her lowly duties of the day&#xD;
in a more tranquil frame of mind, but with a thought heavily&#xD;
fixed upon the future.&#xD;

BYRON.&#xD;

&#xD;
THE prevailing occupation of a people is wont to give bent&#xD;
to the career of its youth. Thus, in agricultural districts, the&#xD;
ambitious boy naturally betakes to farming as a pursuit.&#xD;
Where mechanical art rules, he lays his eager hand upon the&#xD;
craft of the artisan. While amid the hum of manufactures,&#xD;
the female even may be seen gracing the loom.&#xD;
Maritime borders form no exception to the rule. They&#xD;
rather exemplifyr the truth the more strongly. In neighbor-&#xD;
hoods the inhabitants of which draw their life from the ocean,&#xD;
the boy does, indeed, "take to the sea as naturally as a duck&#xD;
to the water." The opening current of his life shoots as uner-&#xD;
ringly toward the great deep, as does the mountain streamlet.&#xD;
But aside from this almost instinctive impulse, arising from&#xD;
hereditary association, there are seductive influences to draw&#xD;
him toward a life upon the ocean-wave.&#xD;
Roaming about the world is congenial to the ceaseless spirit&#xD;
of youth; visiting different climes, gratifying to its love of&#xD;
novelty. Then, to the dweller upon the sea-coast, how capti-&#xD;

and walking the waters a thing of life. Of these winged&#xD;
beckoners coming from the unknown, and passing away into&#xD;

&#xD;
glowing picture, the roseate feelings of childhood but height-&#xD;
ens the charm, while fancy weaves all into a web of enchant-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
This enkindling passion for the sea, is fanned by many in-&#xD;
fluences. It begins to wax in the little tyro, as he makes trial&#xD;
of his tiny craft, in the kitchen tub, or out-door puddle. It&#xD;
burns brighter in the youth, as he appropriates to himself a&#xD;
gayer craft whose qualities he tests with boyish enthusiasm in&#xD;
the neighboring pond or adjoining bay. It mounts still higher,&#xD;
as he listens to the longing sighs and heart-freighted tones of&#xD;
affectionate woman, pining for the absent upon the ocean. He&#xD;
observes with envious heart, how the anticipated return&#xD;
flushes the life-road of the expectant with the sunshine of&#xD;
hope; how hearty the joy that accompanies the arrival greet-&#xD;
ing; what a wave of happiness it dashes through the household;&#xD;
what a tide of sympathy it rolls through the neighborhood.&#xD;
How the heroic is stirred within him at the startling narra-&#xD;
tions to which he listens as spell-bound. How keenly is&#xD;
excited his ambition at observing the cordial welcome show-&#xD;
ered upon the returned from young and old. Then, there is&#xD;
the much coveted leisure of the sailor on shore ; who, removed&#xD;
from his watery prison, circulates among the labor-fettered&#xD;
landsmen with the lordly freedom of a monarch.&#xD;
The whole style and bearing of the welcomed sailor are cal-&#xD;
culated to captivate the ardor of youth ; his free and rolling&#xD;
manners, genial frankness, open generosity, gay and rustling&#xD;
attire,,dashing drives, reckless with abandon and swell; and&#xD;
above all, that Neptune-like countenance, so gay, mirthful,&#xD;
responsive, as if laved in the dewy brine, and illumined by&#xD;
the Aurora of Nature ; the whole calculated to make captive&#xD;
the youthful heart, and lure it to hanker after the sea as a&#xD;
veritable elysium.&#xD;
Yet, however eager the rapturous spirit of youth for a sea-&#xD;
&#xD;
career, there are few who having once laid their bold hand&#xD;
upon the restless main, but would leap to turn back to some&#xD;
vocation on shore. But a brief space suffices to dispel the&#xD;
bright illusion fancy had woven. It is now found, that the&#xD;
fleecy cloud had been gazed at from the bright within, not&#xD;
from the dark without. There was seen the silvery lining&#xD;
touched with the gorgeous hues of the prism -not the leaden&#xD;
canopy at once bleak and rayless.&#xD;
That soft dream of the aspirant did not body forth the giant&#xD;
hardships and bitter privations of a sailor's life, the soulless&#xD;
days on passage, the weary night-watches, the perilous storms,&#xD;
the appalling shipwrecks, the horrid diseases in foreign ports.&#xD;
It did not vibrate to the ear the polluted language of the fore-&#xD;
castle, nor shadow forth to the eye, the fearful mutinies on&#xD;
shipboard, nor the brutal fights on shore. That beckoning&#xD;
vision did not point out the ideal sailor in a sea-rig ; that is, in&#xD;
duck trowsers, baize shirt, and tarpaulin, with a pendent tar&#xD;
or grease bucket, besmearing spars or rigging ; or in some&#xD;
fierce tempest, when the winds and waves contend for mas-&#xD;
tery, shivering under the vessel's rail, in a desponding pea-&#xD;
jacket or surly Nor-easter.&#xD;
Now, Walter did not possess so largely as many others&#xD;
this irrepressible enthusiasm for a sea-life. True,-he was con-&#xD;
siderably infected by the pervading influence of his neighbor-&#xD;
hood, but the two powers within, that were foremost in shap-&#xD;
ing his career, were first an intense desire to see and know&#xD;
the world, but especially, an unappeasable craving to experi-&#xD;
ence a larger and nobler life. Over these feelings his restless&#xD;
spirit had of late, brooded incessantly. They had swallowed&#xD;
up, as it were, his other sentiments, and had arisen to a&#xD;
mastery of his being--had possessed themselves of the helm&#xD;
of his soul, and were steering him on to the one point of his&#xD;
destiny.&#xD;

A SORROWFUL EVENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
29&#xD;
&#xD;
Few fathers, I take it, not even those who have themselves&#xD;
arisen to successful commandership, would elect for a darling&#xD;
son, the roving life of a sailor. An experience strown thick&#xD;
with hardships, as bitter as the, brine of the ocean, they would&#xD;
fain save a loved offspring.&#xD;
Then what tender-hearted mother could calmly yield up her&#xD;
cherished boy, to the frowning perils of the sea. Neither&#xD;
obliterating habit, nor iron necessity, ever effaces so com-&#xD;
pletely, the maternal sympathy of her nature'.          ,&#xD;
But aside from these natural dreads for a sea-life, for her&#xD;
son, darkened by the loss of near and dear ones, whom we&#xD;
have seen the stricken woman lamenting to Walter, Mrs.&#xD;
Carl's pain at the thought of parting from him was increased&#xD;
by a succession of peculiar misfortunes that would have over-&#xD;
whelmed a soul of less fortitude. They fell too upon her in&#xD;
appalling train, moving from their shadowy realms in direful&#xD;
bands.&#xD;
Mrs. Carl's first born child, the early blossom of wedded&#xD;
love, ere six downy months from its birth, was seized with&#xD;
fits. The dreadful event struck all with consternation. Intense&#xD;
grief and solicitude shrowded the household. Friends and&#xD;
neighbors transported with amazement, hastened to make offer-&#xD;
ing of their aid, and to pour the balm of sympathy upon the dis-&#xD;
tracted spirit of the parents, but nought could stay the myste-&#xD;
rious disease. It advanced with fearful strides, the fits becom-&#xD;
ing more and more frequent, until the fair child sank into&#xD;
hopeless lunacy. Oh, what a blight fell upon the mother's&#xD;
heart, as this first budding intelligence of maternal love rose&#xD;
in joy, but to sink from her vision forever !&#xD;
The second child was a girl. It bore the lineaments of&#xD;
uncommon beauty. A     striking grace lay pencilled in its&#xD;
finely chiselled features. Its dawning soul could not but&#xD;
be watched over with the deepest parental solicitude. But,&#xD;
&#xD;
28&#xD;
&#xD;
alas ! for the impotency of human wishes-!  In just six&#xD;
months from birth,--appalling coincidence !-at the precise&#xD;
age which first marked the disease of the hapless brother, as&#xD;
if bound in the folds of some inscrutable fiat of Providence, it,&#xD;
too, began, to show the dreaded symptoms. The nurse at the&#xD;
time was tossing gleefully the little babe in her arms, and was&#xD;
remarking that its tiny life had just reached the brief span&#xD;
allotted its pitiful brother, when those remorseless fits had&#xD;
seized to devour his tender being, and that she prayed in&#xD;
mercy, gracious Heaven might avert so dreadful a calamity&#xD;
from the sweet innocent before her, when, oh ! merciful&#xD;
heavens! as if im mockery of the kind woman's blessing, the&#xD;
helpless little one bent back, as if pierced with. an arrow,&#xD;
raised its tiny hands in a wail of agony, and then sank beneath&#xD;
a whirlpool of convulsions. The scene was touching enough&#xD;
to pierce the stoutest heart.&#xD;
The dreadful event flew through the neighborhood like wild-&#xD;
fire. The mansion was flooded with sorrowful neighbors,&#xD;
speechless with consternation. When the first wave of won-&#xD;
der was over, speculation grew rife, as to the possible cause&#xD;
of the astounding aberration. The superstitious believed it a&#xD;
visitation of divine wrath, for some secret sin committed by&#xD;
the parents. The weak mi ded attributed it to the diabolical&#xD;
agency of an old woman, 1or1g reputed a witch, who was now&#xD;
remembered to have heard breathe threatenings against the&#xD;
family. But the more sensible ruled within them the curious&#xD;
eye of their fancy, seeking not to penetrate the inscrutable&#xD;
secrets of Nature; and gave themselves to the nobler work of&#xD;
the good Samaritan, binding up the wounds of the stricken&#xD;
parents, and pouring into their lacerated spirits the oil of sym-&#xD;
pathy.&#xD;
These children continued to live and grow. Indeed, they&#xD;
were remarkably fair to look upon. They retained the - im-&#xD;

press I of a deep spiritual grace, while a more than mortal&#xD;
beauty. shone from their delirious eye and hectic face. Yet,&#xD;
this brightened radiance was but the glowing monition of a&#xD;
lingering sunset. To the agonized sight of despair, it looked&#xD;
as if some fiend were touching with celestial hues the mirror-&#xD;
ing infant soul, only to wring with harder grip the parental&#xD;
heart, by magnifying the greatness of its loss.&#xD;
,,But although reason was ' dethroned, some of the faculties&#xD;
flashed up into a more vivid flame, by the shifting volcano&#xD;
within. If the orb of light had withdrawn from the centre, it&#xD;
was pouring its effulgence with redoubled force upon the&#xD;
verge of the soul. Speech lay fettered in duinb incoherency,&#xD;
and kingly reason had sunk into a midnight of gloom, but&#xD;
Argus memory, and lynx-eyed perception, had acquired a&#xD;
Sampson-like strength.&#xD;
The boy in growing up was kept with maternal vigilance&#xD;
within the bounds of care, but not so the girl; her deranged&#xD;
mind shot forth as erratic as a crazed comet athwart a harmo-&#xD;
nious sky. Her spirit was as restless as the chafed oedan.&#xD;
Defeating every means of restraint or confinement, she was&#xD;
ever escaping from home, and roaming abroad at will. These&#xD;
fantastic flights took her through dismal swamps, across ford-&#xD;
less streams, and into people's houses at midnight; by what&#xD;
means it was mysterious to everybody. Contemplating her in&#xD;
this phase, one might have fancied her some haunting spectre&#xD;
left to wander up and down the earth.&#xD;
Feats were at times done by her that looked really super-&#xD;
human. Such may be mentioned as severing the links of her&#xD;
chain without apparent means; passing through fastened&#xD;
doors and barred windows, or running swiftly along the verge&#xD;
of the house-top. It would seem that the furies had gotten&#xD;
possession of the girl, and were hurrying her to and fro, just&#xD;
in contempt of the laws of corporeal and spiritual life.&#xD;
&#xD;
Among other idiosyncrasies was a fugitive passion for some&#xD;
article for plaything. The coveted thing possessed, and toyed&#xD;
, with a brief season, was thrown aside as a cast-off garment,&#xD;
for a new one. This seemed but an intenser form of that un-&#xD;
satisfying nature common to the universal heart. Her cun-&#xD;
ning and invention were most marvellous. Creating the&#xD;
means of escape, in some inadvertent moment, she would dis-&#xD;
appear like the vanishing of a ghost. Pursuing her were like&#xD;
chasing the shadow of a dream. Flying to the house of the&#xD;
coveted object, she would appropriate it, and return with the&#xD;
celerity of Ariel. All vigilance was baffled. Locks and&#xD;
bolts were merely so many gossamer threads.   To attempt&#xD;
wresting the stolen article from her, was struggling with Her-&#xD;
cules. In an encounter, her strength multiplied like that of a&#xD;
mad-man. Neither could one of her toys be successfully hid-&#xD;
den from her. She would proceed straight to the hiding-place&#xD;
with unerring instinct.&#xD;
- As if to symbolize the work of ruination within, her hand&#xD;
seemed bent upon destruction, as naturally as the sparks fly&#xD;
upwards. Nothing ever so. rare or costly could escape her&#xD;
sharp glance. Furniture, plate, food, toys and adornments,&#xD;
would disappear like the crumbling of frost-work. Not&#xD;
even her own clothing was exempt from the general devasta-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
The maintenance of these children wasted of itself the in-&#xD;
come of a fortune. Still, Mrs. Carl with genuine motherly&#xD;
instinct, resisted all persuasion to have them placed in an&#xD;
asylum for the insane. Their very forlornness of soul stirred&#xD;
to its depths her tenderness of spirit, and made her shrink&#xD;
with anguish at the thought of entrusting them  to others.&#xD;
Her devotion intensified from the helplessness of its object.&#xD;
Her affection grew into a species of delirium, which, while&#xD;
it honored human nature, showed the depth of love in a&#xD;

mother's heart, and the abnegation of which a loyal spirit is&#xD;
capable.&#xD;
After a considerable lapse of time in the flowering period&#xD;
of conjugal life, another child was born to Mrs. Carl. Like&#xD;
the other, it was a girl; a lily blond, with sunny ringlets,&#xD;
soft blue eyes, and sweet ingenuous face. Its unfolding life&#xD;
was watched over, with a solicitude trembling between fear&#xD;
and hope. But the fated period had passed, and each day&#xD;
was bringing fresh assurance to the mother's heart. If the&#xD;
others had been shorn of the sunlight of intelligence, this fair&#xD;
girl supplied a compensation. For she seemed transparent&#xD;
with the sheen of intellectuality. The deep shadows of her&#xD;
home could not drive the sunbeams of nature from her heart,&#xD;
and she bloomed into maidenhood a joyous sylph-like being,&#xD;
seeming just to touch this earth, so blithely did she trip over&#xD;
its dewy verdure. She shed a bright halo in the gloomy path-&#xD;
way of Mrs. Carl. But a young English physician whom&#xD;
some. throw of chance, had brought to the neighborhood, saw&#xD;
tke spirited being, became fascinated with her loveliness, and&#xD;
surrendered his heart to her spell. How hard to the mother,&#xD;
the thought of parting with the sweet solace of her poignant&#xD;
hours, of entrusting to a stranger the idol of her heart. Was&#xD;
she to gain a son, or lose a daughter?  Had he'come to fulfil&#xD;
the sweet law of nature to the wedded girl, to give fulness to&#xD;
her existence, to complete her womanhood, or would he, ii-&#xD;
stead, scatter mildew upon her fresh soul, poison the well-&#xD;
springs of her joy, sap the foundation of her nature, and lay&#xD;
the cold hand of blight upon her life!&#xD;
They were betrothed; but a few weeks before the bond of&#xD;
union was to be sealed, she fell a victim to consumption, that&#xD;
scourge of New England.&#xD;
The fourth child was a girl, as well, a fine featured brunette,&#xD;
with raven hair, and large, lustrous eyes, bespeaking tender-&#xD;

ness of soul. A native maidenly grace, joined to a modest&#xD;
charm of manner, made her a favorite throughout the neigh-&#xD;
borhood. Despite the dread penury of her home, the fair&#xD;
girl's favor was sought far and near. Especially, did many a&#xD;
rising young seaman press for her hand. The sailor above&#xD;
all others, listens to the voice of his heart, in choosing his&#xD;
mate. The coveted maiden was at length born off, by a gay&#xD;
young captain, as a happy-prize from amid fragrant isles. But&#xD;
in six rosy months from the nuptials, she too was numbered&#xD;
with the blighted hopes of the bereaved mother.&#xD;
Added to the other griefs of the widow, was the loss, as&#xD;
previously mentioned, of her husband by drowning. Bereave-&#xD;
ments there are, that do not disrobe existence quite of its ves-&#xD;
ture of joy, but the removal by death of a bosom companion -&#xD;
the irreparable sundering of two hearts, grown into a new life,&#xD;
in which every object reflects the bright image of this new&#xD;
birth - brings a desolation of woe, that must be felt to be&#xD;
understood.&#xD;
The marriage of Mrs. Carl was at that early youth, when&#xD;
the virginal sentiments twine with greenest vigor;, when the&#xD;
soul throws most fondly the gorgeous dreams of fancy, over&#xD;
the being of its choice ; when the heart clasps with holiest&#xD;
persistence, the sweet idol of its own creation.&#xD;
A woof of propitious circumstances cradled the dawning of&#xD;
the new life of the happy couple. Mrs. Carl wag an idol-&#xD;
daughter, and a beauty. She grew up in those times of severe&#xD;
simplicity, when native worth could bloom into a lovely flow-&#xD;
er, free of the tarnishing breath of a perverted society.&#xD;
Mr. Carl seemed likewise a favored child. of Nature. His&#xD;
step-father perceiving the boy's promise, advanced him quickly&#xD;
to the command of one of his vessels. He did even more.&#xD;
When the young man had proved worthy of his trust, had&#xD;
sealed with success the high judgment formed of him, he did&#xD;

not pocket all the earnings, and use Capt. Carl merely as an&#xD;
instrument to swell his own fortune. No, Mr. Damon was&#xD;
animated by nobler principles of life. With the generosity of&#xD;
greatness, he tendered the young man a principal share of the&#xD;
fine vessel he sailed.&#xD;
Thus, at the early age of nineteen, the young captain could&#xD;
pace the deck of his own vessel, flushed with the emotions of&#xD;
lofty achievement; for this was when commandership had a&#xD;
meaning. It imparted lustre in the eyes of the settlement.&#xD;
It dazzled the eyes of the maidens. Capt. Carl was reckon-&#xD;
ed, too, among the finest looking of -young men, one had ever&#xD;
seen tread a quarter-deck. There was a mingling - of the&#xD;
noble and tender in his bearing, well calculated to captivate&#xD;
the female heart.&#xD;
Thus equipped, the happy couple launched gayly upon the&#xD;
future. Golden suns were above, and sparkling waves danced&#xD;
beneath them. The very skies looked propitiously down. And&#xD;
the horizon of life broadened in azure tenderness upon their&#xD;
sight. But the morn does not reveal the meridian day. Sor-&#xD;
row came like a drenching cloud. Capt. Carl's step-father&#xD;
suddenly died. By this the son lost his share in the vessel by&#xD;
some informality in the legal conveyance. Soon another ill-&#xD;
luck stripped him of his hard earned all. Bereavement bowed&#xD;
down his spirit, and his maniac children strained his every&#xD;
exertion for their support. He seemed now on the downward&#xD;
disc of the wheel of fortune. His barque was struggling upon&#xD;
the receding billow. Every enterprise touched failed, like&#xD;
the crumbling of frost-work. Some slight thread would break,.&#xD;
often in the last moment, to ruin all., The prestiges of mis-&#xD;
fortune foreshadowed him like-an evil omen. The sentiment&#xD;
of illbuck beat in his own breast, and jaundiced the vision of&#xD;
others. At last, his very name became a by-word of ill-&#xD;
starred-fate, and men feared to associate with him in any&#xD;

enterprise, lest they, too, should catch  the contagion of his evil&#xD;
genius.&#xD;
There are two different spirits discernible in the struggle&#xD;
of life. One, when borne hard upon by the pressing train&#xD;
of. ill-fortune, gradually yields, until its vision, darkened&#xD;
by the misty cloud rising before the horizon of its faith&#xD;
sinks below the wave of dejection, in utter impotence of will.&#xD;
The other, like a staunch ship, sets its snug sail a trim to&#xD;
the careering gale, and doggedly beats into port; or, casting&#xD;
the anchor of Hope, it holds fast amid the roaring surges, un-&#xD;
til the brightening up of the pitchy skies.&#xD;
When ill-stared Fate like a haunting Spirit pursues us, it is&#xD;
undoubtedly heroic, to spurn incredulously his seductive ap-&#xD;
proaches ; to turn a deaf ear to his illusive whisperings; to&#xD;
uncoil with main might the doublings of his gripping folds;&#xD;
in fine, to rush upon the athletic foe, and cut with the&#xD;
sword of decision the gathering web of our ruin. But&#xD;
who is quite equal to this? Who can resist the sombre&#xD;
delusions of ill-luck. Who annihilate the train of misfor-&#xD;
tune that wraps around the ill-fated like the atmosphere the&#xD;
breathe?&#xD;
Such potency was not at least vouchsafed to the husband&#xD;
of Mrs. Carl. When the clouds of misfortune had gathered&#xD;
thick over his path-way, he gradually sunk into their shadow&#xD;
forgotten. He whose name had been bright upon every l&#xD;
no longer provoked the buzz of the fickle crowd. The melt-&#xD;
ing waters behind the trackless ship close not more com-&#xD;
pletely, than did the rippling wave of society over his golden&#xD;
past.&#xD;
Thus to pass down the shady slope of life, is not the easiest&#xD;
of human lot. Yet Capt. Carl suffered in silence. No mur-&#xD;
mur was heard to escape hi3 lips. His was a resignation that&#xD;
vaunteth not itself. It was a current too deep and tranquil&#xD;

for that. Suffering could not shake the integrity of his soul.&#xD;
The serenity of upright intention beamed placidly upon his&#xD;
brow to the last. He could never learn the wily lesson of&#xD;
dishonesty. The insight of experience only repelled his na-&#xD;
ture from the guile of false seeming. Men called incapacity&#xD;
what was an inherent moral recitude that debarred every spe-&#xD;
cies of deception. Indeed, he seemed too good for earth; and&#xD;
when lie passed away, hearts dropped a smiling tear of grati-&#xD;
tude, and breathed a sigh of relief.&#xD;
We shall seek almost in vain for the grace of a sweet and&#xD;
noble character, amid the hill-peaks of successful life. As&#xD;
well should we expect a vesture clean after being drawn&#xD;
through the muddy pool of Dives. The dashing mountain&#xD;
cataract may figure to the passing eye, but we turn to the&#xD;
gushing rill, sequestered from view to taste the sweet waters&#xD;
fresh from the pure fount of Nature.&#xD;
These afflictions of Mrs. Carl were followed by a long sea-&#xD;
son of physical prostration. Overshadowing Dyspepsia came&#xD;
with his inexorable'brood,-to gnaw at the vitals of life !&#xD;
And, now, there was left but a single flower in her family-&#xD;
garden. Who could blame the widow for worshipping this&#xD;
remaining solace, with the fullest passion of soul. With a&#xD;
nature enriched by deep experience, its full tenderness was&#xD;
concentrated upon this sole object of her affections. Well&#xD;
might the thought of parting with him cut like severing soul&#xD;
and body. Yet the wringing sacrifice was made. A flexible&#xD;
soul, she rose to an elevation with fortune. She triumphed&#xD;
over the tenderness of nature, but only with a pang deep and&#xD;
lasting.&#xD;
How measureless the capability of the human soul! Trials&#xD;
we thought insupportable, gradually yield before the master-&#xD;
ing energies of a true nature.&#xD;
A giant grief may be likened to a mountain billow. It&#xD;
&#xD;
comes rolling on, threatening to submerge our trembling&#xD;
barque, but the noble vessel, like a genuine spirit, mounts by&#xD;
degrees the swollen sea, until poised majestically upon its&#xD;
breezy ridge, it glows a-strong in the gale and su&#xD;
heaven.&#xD;

LONGING FOR THE SEA.         39&#xD;

CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
" A thousand thoughts of all things dear,&#xD;
Like visions o'er me sweep,&#xD;
I leave my sunny childhood here -&#xD;
Oh, therefore let me weep."&#xD;
MRS. IEMANS.&#xD;
To a kindly nature, struggles there are, in which victory&#xD;
brings no feeling of exultation. When triumph carries a gall&#xD;
of bitterness to those we love, the generous heart melts in&#xD;
sympathy, and in an excess of affection, we regret even the&#xD;
fortune we have achieved.&#xD;
Thus was it with Walter. When he contemplated the tem-&#xD;
pest-shattered frame of his mother, as the outward symbol of&#xD;
a more disastrous wreck within, his filial nature was lively&#xD;
touched. 'When he reflected that the point gained toward his&#xD;
darling hope had added fresh grief to the endeared author of&#xD;
his days, he was deeply moved. But as the memory of her&#xD;
consecrated life of affection to his every need and wish came&#xD;
rushing in distinct, swelling billows to his mind, a pulsation of&#xD;
tender emotion swept through his soul, and paralyzed every&#xD;
energy of his will.&#xD;
Then there was the saddened thought of parting with many&#xD;
a youthful companion; of leaving, perhaps forever, the sunny&#xD;
haunts of youth, endeared spots that had become closely en-&#xD;
twined around his plastic affections. To these might be added&#xD;
that sorrowful depression of spirit, which precedes the first&#xD;
step in the path of a new career.&#xD;
(38)&#xD;
&#xD;
Under the thronging weight of these emotions, he more&#xD;
than half repented the resolution of leaving home for the sea.&#xD;
But it is not thus easy to arrest the momentum of a purpose,&#xD;
that has gained possession of our being. Then, the keenest&#xD;
regrets are but so many eddies in the stream of our destiny.&#xD;
The main current of our fate moves us on with irresistible&#xD;
sway and celerity.&#xD;
In the ardor of youthful aspiration, Walter was eager to&#xD;
launch off at once, on board a square rigger. This would&#xD;
gratify his longing for seeing foreign lands, a desire that&#xD;
glowed in his bosom with intense fervor. But to this step&#xD;
Mrs. Carl interposed a heart-appealing denial. As a compro-&#xD;
mise, the humble lot of a fishing-cruise was agreed upon. To&#xD;
this end, propitious chance revealed a gladsome opening. An&#xD;
uncle of Walter, the only surviving brother of his lamented&#xD;
father, happened just then to be fitting out a wee craft for a&#xD;
summer's stroll a-fishing. This to Mrs. Carl seemed provi-&#xD;
dential; and her overjoyed heart, embraced the good fortune&#xD;
with lively gratitude.&#xD;
Capt. Carl, Walter's uncle, was a mildly man, of a pious&#xD;
mood, verging to the superstitious. He was one of those&#xD;
honey-moon characters which no amount of seething in the&#xD;
world's caldron can acidify. Even up to the sober age of&#xD;
manhood, he retained the petty, bauble disposition of child-&#xD;
hood. His mental vision seemed cast with the iris of the sum-&#xD;
mer rainbow. The crucible of life had in his case failed to&#xD;
precipitate the sweet foibles of youth; and had at length cast&#xD;
him out but a child of older growth, a little sered by the hand&#xD;
of Time.&#xD;
But he possessed many qualities that looked toward the&#xD;
noble; and in his graver moments, there beamed forth in his&#xD;
bearing a certain classic dignity, that Was really captivating.&#xD;
You would have said, that Dame Nature cut him out for one&#xD;

&#xD;
of her noblestgieces of workmanship, but that he had been&#xD;
spoiled in the making up.&#xD;
He was, however, a good seamen and safe navigator ;and&#xD;
in those times of our growing commerce, his services were&#xD;
ever in ready demand. Still, his success was thwarted by a&#xD;
single eccentric trait, which hung upon his path, like an incu-&#xD;
bus. This was unsteadiness to a single line of business. But&#xD;
it did not spring from a bold, enterprising spirit, that chafes in&#xD;
the dusty harness of life, but from a restless imitative bent of&#xD;
mind, that like the flitting butterfly, is ever on the wing, for a&#xD;
novel object. Or it might have arisen from a perverted fancy&#xD;
that is blind to the immediate, and only sees distant objects&#xD;
in the bright colors of a hallucinating mirage.&#xD;
Well, after being tossed about through youth upon the very&#xD;
wave of accident, he at last cast anchor in a berth, which af-&#xD;
forded hope for a season of quiet stability. . This was in the&#xD;
command he had gained of a fine brig plying between a south-&#xD;
ern port of our Union, and a famed city of the Old World.&#xD;
The time of which we speak, was, it should be remembered,&#xD;
in the infancy of our marine, when command brought distinc-&#xD;
tion, and crossing the Atlanic was an achievement to be&#xD;
prided upon, for a life time.&#xD;
This fine position of Capt. Carl joined to a gracious exte-&#xD;
rior filled his. neighborhood at home with his popularity. He&#xD;
might now, it would seem, have yielded to the inflowing tide&#xD;
of prosperity, and been content to be borne along upon its&#xD;
glassy bosom. But no ; the flickering star of his genius would&#xD;
not have it thus. He must needs follow the bent of his habit,&#xD;
and change. Well, we will not quarrel with Nature, if a little&#xD;
capricious in her manifestations, she does here and there vary&#xD;
the phases of human character. The diadem upon the brow&#xD;
of night, would be robbed of half its peerless beauty, did every&#xD;
star-gem beam with uniform splendor.&#xD;
&#xD;
A SECOND MARRIAGE.                 41&#xD;
After one of his voyages, on a visit home to his children,&#xD;
Capt. Carl fell into the amiable fortune of a second marriage.&#xD;
To a mariner just landed from sea, every woman appears an&#xD;
angel; and although brave to the last amidst the perils of the&#xD;
ocean, yet the sailor yields readily to the fascinating spell of&#xD;
beauty.&#xD;
With a resolution more honorable to the heart than com-&#xD;
mendable to prudence, Capt. Carl gave up at once his advan-&#xD;
tageous position, with the view of attempting something that&#xD;
might employ him nearer the bosom of his family. Springing&#xD;
his imitative faculties, he struck out a miniature-model of a&#xD;
fine coaster. When built, the vessel appeared a taunt, airy&#xD;
looking craft, a little unique to be sure, yet striking and hand-&#xD;
some. But on trial, she proved' so crank under sail, and so&#xD;
deficient withal in stowage, as to be neither safe as a sea-boat&#xD;
nor profitable as a carrier. The flaunting schooner was no in-&#xD;
apt emblem of many a pretentious mortal who, though pre-&#xD;
possessing to the eye, yet proves upon trial entirely inade-&#xD;
quate to bear safely over the ocean of Time, the invaluable&#xD;
freight of Life !&#xD;
Having sunk in this exotic enterprise the fruits of years&#xD;
hard beating the seas, he fell back upon the lowly calling of&#xD;
fishing.  But this just then was not a reluctant step. In its&#xD;
loss of dignity or pecuniary emolument, he was soothed by the&#xD;
honorable anticipations of revelling more freely in the sweets&#xD;
of conjugal felicity. How happy that our unluckiest fate is&#xD;
accompanied by some gleam of brightness to reconcile us to&#xD;
the ill-fortune. It may be but a speck of light amid the sur-&#xD;
rounding gloom, but its nearness shuts off the greater dark-&#xD;
ness, as a ray of sunshine flung across our path-way distracts&#xD;
the attention from the portentious gloom of the approaching&#xD;
cloud.&#xD;
If, then, Walter must go to sea, what more favorable than&#xD;

THE OLD SCHOOL-HOUSE.           43&#xD;
&#xD;
a berth with his uncle. It is true that so humble a calling&#xD;
hardly fulfilled the ambitious aspirations of Mrs. Carl, but in&#xD;
the deep solicitude of her spirit, worldly preferment was for-&#xD;
gotten.&#xD;
Soon, alas, too soon, for the widow's aching heart, all was&#xD;
arranged. But a few days were now to elapse, before the&#xD;
sailing of the vessel, and this brief interval seemed shortened&#xD;
by the press of matters clamoring for attention previously to&#xD;
getting off. Yet Walter could not refrain stealing away more&#xD;
than once in the time, to gaze again and yet again upon the&#xD;
many endeared spots about his home. These looked like the,&#xD;
serene face of friends that had sported with him along the rosy&#xD;
morn of life ; and now that he must leave them, he felt all the&#xD;
more keenly how closely they had become entwined around&#xD;
the halcyon associations of his childhood.&#xD;
There was, for instance, the Old Red School House, with&#xD;
its low gable roof;, greatly revered as the rough portal to the&#xD;
fane of learning; and deeply enshrined in the soul of Walter,&#xD;
by the varied emotions of school-life. The very shrine of in-&#xD;
tellectual greatness, the venerable hall of science, seemed in&#xD;
no way vain of display. For instead of standing boastfully&#xD;
upon the " corners of four roads," it was modestly embosomed&#xD;
some half a mile away from any dwelling, amid a broad young&#xD;
woodland, through which straggled here and there a path,&#xD;
worn by the ceaseless feet of generations of youth.&#xD;
Then, near the time-honored school-house, smiled the wel-&#xD;
come White Spot, an oval shaped ground, singularly cut out&#xD;
amid the sapplings, as anomolous as a verdant oasis in a burn-&#xD;
ing desert. This hemmed in tiny play-ground, had become&#xD;
worn to white sand, packed smooth by the daily shuffling and&#xD;
tramping of feet in the seductive and breathless games at ball&#xD;
during the school-recesses; but with a conscience less effaced&#xD;
by repeated rubbings this same "White Spot" would have&#xD;
&#xD;
felt much to atone for, in the castigations it brought the invol-&#xD;
untary truants, by luring them just one minute longer after&#xD;
the hated, but ominous double rap of the teacher upon the&#xD;
vibrating window sash.&#xD;
A little further down, at the foot of the reeling avenue&#xD;
stretched the two long "Hollows," which like open natures,&#xD;
ever of a noon-time, drew the older boys to inspiriting con-&#xD;
tests at foot-ball.&#xD;
Hard by these, interposed the interminable swamp over&#xD;
which hung a mist of awe as profound as the unknown in the&#xD;
soul of man. Silence reigned there supreme, broken only at&#xD;
long intervals, by the wailing scream of some beseeching bird,&#xD;
or the curdling hiss of a cruel reptile. Useless too seemed&#xD;
this stagnation of earth, except for the dire phantoms it was&#xD;
wont to give forth in the dusk of a summer evening ; or the&#xD;
witches it furnished of a gloomy day, to the superstitious part&#xD;
of the school.&#xD;
But let us peep into the Old Knowledge Box, as the quaint&#xD;
temple of learning was facetiously called, by a waggish lad&#xD;
whose fertile fancy was more apt at instituting comparisons,&#xD;
than in discovering the cue to the solution of sums in Dabol.&#xD;
Well, on creaking open the weather-beaten door, the eye&#xD;
runs wondrously through the high narrow entry, half piled&#xD;
with pine wood, and then falls with complacency upon the&#xD;
Old Oaken Bucket, with its thick wooden lip, and ponderous&#xD;
iron bail.&#xD;
This dingy "watering pot," firmly clasped with iron bands,&#xD;
and strongly riveted, was made in the days, when good old&#xD;
Honesty had not discovered the knack of contriving his work&#xD;
fair to the eye, and, at the same time, introducing into it the&#xD;
elements of speedy dissolution.&#xD;
From time beyond memory the grateful vessel had made&#xD;
its daily pilgrimage to the distant brook, as sure as the&#xD;

&#xD;
promptingsgf'insatiable nature.- Especially of a sultry sum-&#xD;
mer afternoon, might it be seen slowly swinging and surging&#xD;
its return, upon a puny pole, between two of the happiest of&#xD;
the sons of Dame Nature, quite oblivious to the exactions of&#xD;
father Time, or the dread of sore punishment in store for&#xD;
tardy feet.&#xD;
Opening the "inside door," reveals the double row of long&#xD;
heavy benches of the school-room, rising with the sloped floor,&#xD;
and cut and scarred as deeply as Immortality herself could&#xD;
desire. In the aisle before us extending quite across the build-&#xD;
ing stands the capacious stove, which, like a generous nature,,&#xD;
is rough but warm-hearted, and, if at times partial in dif-&#xD;
fusing its favors, yet always whole-souled in its greetings.&#xD;
At the left, upon the low, wide platform, rises from its four&#xD;
naked legs, the ever to be remembered Teacher's Desk. De-&#xD;
spite the modest look and conspicuous position of this van-&#xD;
guard of pedagogical power, so completely impressed is it with&#xD;
the responsibility of place, as to be able to hold up its dignity,&#xD;
even in face of the whole school. Yankee-like it has served&#xD;
several ends, anong them, the very convenient one of bowing&#xD;
the stubborn necks of sinning urchins, or of stifling their des-&#xD;
perate cries beneath its irrevocable lid.&#xD;
Within these humble walls, with knees upon the scarred&#xD;
form before him, Walter had sat many a live-long day, some-&#xD;
times commendably enough with eyes intent upon book, but&#xD;
oftener, very likely, watching the sharp eye of the teacher, or&#xD;
gazing wistfully at the tiny black hands of the old silver time-=&#xD;
piece suspended above. Or more likely still, ever and anon,&#xD;
stealing a winsome glance, at- some favorite upon the girl's&#xD;
side of the room. At one time, it may have been the pale,&#xD;
sympathetic face of Nancy ; at another, the tender, blue eyes&#xD;
of Mary, with which rosy fingered Fancy was painting a sweet.&#xD;
image of girlhood upon the sanctuary of his soul.&#xD;
&#xD;
But the soft picture was purely within. It had yet no&#xD;
counterpart. It was merely a lovely ideal throwing its dawn-&#xD;
ing flush over the youthful sentiments. Then this budding&#xD;
affection was moreover within the inner court of the heart. It&#xD;
was too sacred to be profaned by mortal touch. No intimacy&#xD;
could share it; not even the fair beings whose unconscious&#xD;
beauty, was the glowing pencil, were aware of the work they&#xD;
were doing. The bright image was of course graced with the&#xD;
nameless charms of perfection. How happy that the imagin-&#xD;
ation can invest its object with its own bright hues.&#xD;
But the Old School-House with its memory-embalmed sur-&#xD;
roundings, were not the only spots to cast a spell around the&#xD;
lingering feet of Nathan. There gleamed away on the other&#xD;
side of the mansion, the ever flowing mill-pond, thick with&#xD;
merry associations. By its stilly edges, Nathan with rod in&#xD;
hand, had whiled away many a happy hour, in trying to con-&#xD;
jure up from its mysterious depths some of the varied watery&#xD;
tribe there ensconsed; now jerking from below some coquette&#xD;
of a perch; again tugging away at an unwilling eel; or, per-&#xD;
chance, ousting from his muddy bed some grim surly snapping&#xD;
turtle.&#xD;
Or in the .silvery moonlight of a winter evening, when the&#xD;
glassy face of the pond mirrored the exuberance of youthful&#xD;
glee, how fascinating had been the skating exercise, the jovial&#xD;
dance around the mirthful fire, kept up by poachings from the&#xD;
neighboring fences, the fleet coasting down the embankment,&#xD;
across the crystal ice, and neck or naught into the peevish&#xD;
underbrush on the opposite side.&#xD;
Far up the stream, emerged all silent from the sluggish&#xD;
waters, the fast anchored islet, frequented but in one season&#xD;
of the year, and then only for that mischievous and cruel, but&#xD;
most fascinating of sports -namely, bird's nesting.&#xD;
Yet these stagnant waters surrounding the woody islet sent&#xD;

&#xD;
up profusely from their muddy excrescence -like a fair child&#xD;
from ill-featured parents -the pure lily, so nice as a token&#xD;
of affection for sister. Then, there were the cool bull-rushes&#xD;
for the; fantastic cap, and the tenacious flags, so opportune for&#xD;
mending grandmother's old chairs.&#xD;
At the lower end of the pond where the stream makes a&#xD;
slight nodding toward the ocean, was the well used mill-darn&#xD;
with its bridge of unmatched planks, jutting out unevenly, like&#xD;
ill-assorted bed-fellows. On the upper end of one of these,&#xD;
Walter, sprawled upon his face, had lain time and again, gaz-&#xD;
ing with dreamy inspiration upon the opaque waters below,&#xD;
which, like the ceaseless stream of life, would glide adown, to&#xD;
be seen no more. Once, losing his equipoise, he tumbled&#xD;
headlong into the hurrying current. He had not acquired the&#xD;
art of swimming, but from sheer instinct he floundered safely&#xD;
to the bank.&#xD;
Or, standing upon the lower end of the bridge, enrapt with&#xD;
the view of the livid sheet of water, now ejected through the&#xD;
narrow crevice of the flood-gate, now pouring in majesty over&#xD;
the flume, while the big, mossy, slimy water-wheel, would turn&#xD;
over and over like the unvaried round of day.,&#xD;
Of a Monday summer forenoon, he would stop to listen to&#xD;
the garrulous chat of the merry washers, under the wide&#xD;
branching shade of the gigantic solitary oak, dipping their&#xD;
crystal waters from the unfailing spring, that oozed from the&#xD;
surrounding marsh.&#xD;
But what interested him most deeply, because instinct with&#xD;
life and sympathy, was watching the newly arrived herring.&#xD;
These harbingers of awakening spring would scurry in the&#xD;
boiling brook below, or with a skill surpassing reason, leap the&#xD;
rough water-fall; or, alas, more likely seized in their career&#xD;
by. the wily net, would lie. flapping and gasping upon the&#xD;
sandy flat, no inapt emblem of some ambitious mortal, whose&#xD;
&#xD;
vaulting strides up the ladder of Fame are cut off by the in-&#xD;
sidious hand of Death.&#xD;
These were but a few of the haunts about his home, to&#xD;
which his soul had grown with the green vigor of spring-time.&#xD;
Parting from them was like cleaving the heart from its youth-&#xD;
ful loves.&#xD;
So long had Walter lingered around the Old Mill, that the&#xD;
sun had sunk below the verdant pine-tops. Although hidden&#xD;
from view, he was still flinging profusely his crimson rays&#xD;
upon the gossamer clouds in the sky. Wending slowly toward&#xD;
home, the boy had but just emerged from the meagre woodland&#xD;
that skirted the pond, when his eye fell upon a female figure&#xD;
in the distance. She was in the broad field, on the other side&#xD;
of the rivulet, pursuing her way in a direction toward the&#xD;
brook. Walter, it must be confessed, inherited that amiable&#xD;
sentiment for woman common to his sex. His pathetic mood&#xD;
of mind, moreover, in view of leaving home, gave just then a&#xD;
peculiar liveliness to his feelings. But both circumstances&#xD;
could hardly have awakened unusual attention to so ordinary&#xD;
an incident as encountering a female upon a public road, but&#xD;
that the unknown betrayed a singular ungainliness of mien&#xD;
that grew more striking as she approached.&#xD;
Her appearance was tall, but not shapely. Upon a narrow&#xD;
woollen skirt, and a little short withal - fell one of those tri-&#xD;
colored blankets of olden time, descending from the head, and&#xD;
pinned demurely under the chin. Her scanty garb, time worn&#xD;
and faded, betokened extreme penury to be her lot.&#xD;
When first seen by Walter, she was making her way along&#xD;
with a fleet step, giving every now and then a wild toss of the&#xD;
head, and fetching as often a strange supple hitch, which set&#xD;
off drolly her ambulating gait. It was this latter particular,&#xD;
that struck Walter oddly. Yet as she neared the boy, her&#xD;
carriage gained in gracefulness, and he could not help noticing&#xD;

that she was evidently timing her speed to meet him upon the&#xD;
bridge. ' They did pass each other there, just as if it had been&#xD;
pre-arranged. But sweeping by horridly, the girl darted upon&#xD;
Walter a shy glance, yet so full of searching earnestness, as&#xD;
quite to startle the boy with wonder. Near, her countenance&#xD;
betokened more youthfulness, than her figure at a - distance&#xD;
would indicate. It might, moreover, under congenial circum-&#xD;
stances, have been prepossessing; but now there was engraved&#xD;
thereupon so haggard and unreal a look, giving an expression-&#xD;
so wandering and frantic like, as to arouse the curiosity of&#xD;
Walter to the highest pitch. Indeed, so lively was this feel-&#xD;
ing, that in proceeding homeward, lie could not help turning&#xD;
round again, and yet again, to get one more sight of the&#xD;
strange mortal whom he had just met. But by a singular&#xD;
coincidence, as if mutually moved to it, by some presiding&#xD;
Divinity, they found themselves gazing at each other, always,&#xD;
just at the same moment. At length, fairly abashed, at be-&#xD;
traying' so much boldness, he hastened on to the mansion,&#xD;
where, concealed behind a pillar of the portico, he watched&#xD;
unperceived her receding form, until it faded from view.&#xD;
Night was now fast lowering the gray folds of her majestic&#xD;
curtain, benignantly reminding all of the sweet season for&#xD;
repose. With pensive step, Walter opened the welcome door&#xD;
of his home, ruminating upon the mysterious incident that&#xD;
had seized him beyond his power to throw off. In his simple&#xD;
life, it bore the tinge of romance. The face he felt sure of&#xD;
never before having seen. This in a part of the country, so&#xD;
retired, that the appearance of a stranger never failed of creat-&#xD;
ing a stir, was of itself a novelty. Then there was that deep,&#xD;
suffering look, the mystery of which he could not divine, and&#xD;
contrasting withal so strangely with her volatile movements.&#xD;
But the soft spring which more than any other, kept her image&#xD;
uppermost in his mind, was the marked interest she betrayed&#xD;
&#xD;
for Walter, despite the evident pains she-took to conceal it.&#xD;
Who can resist the charm of being preferred ! And if the&#xD;
preference be shown by a female, at that guileless period of&#xD;
youth, before the heart has known deception, how quickening&#xD;
the delight ! The virgin emotions awakened, are among the&#xD;
delicious drops in the cup of terrestrial happiness.&#xD;

THE day was a bustling one at the mansion. Themorrow&#xD;
ben the one set for the sailing of the fishing-smack, the en-&#xD;
tire household were early astir for lending all needful aid in&#xD;
preparation for the departure. Then there were numerous&#xD;
calls from relatives and friends, to bid good bye, with hearty&#xD;
wishes for good luck and a safe return.&#xD;
Walter had always been a favorite in the neighborhood.&#xD;
Yet nowit became more fully apparent how deeply his gentle&#xD;
nature had won upoh everybody. For young and old thronged&#xD;
the mason to press his hand, and drop a tear of regret at the&#xD;
loss of one whose absence would leave a void in the settle-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
Such is the power of unaffected goodness. It steals upon&#xD;
the heart with the soft tread of r'osy morn, but its sway is the&#xD;

boy, a poor widow's son who was the object of this artless oya-&#xD;
tion, yet who shall not say, that their simple tokens of homage,&#xD;
were not more expressive than the huzzas that crowd the&#xD;
steps Hof an emperor. Indeed, it is these sweet rills of affe-&#xD;

These neighborly sympathies continued up to a late hour in&#xD;
the evening ; when with that thoughtful solicitude which is&#xD;
the sweet offspring of maternal love, Mrs. Carl kindly urges&#xD;
her son to retire.&#xD;
How sadly tender was breathed now their mutual "good&#xD;

reality of separation. Then, perhaps, it was their last good&#xD;
night upon earth. Inexorable Time and the treacherous wave&#xD;
that were to intervene, darkly increased such an apprehension.&#xD;
Emotions of tender regret tinged the deepening cloud hover-&#xD;
ing over the horizon of their faith. A, how painful&#xD;
thought of separating from those we truly love.&#xD;
Walter might go, and soothe his agitated spirit i  h  -&#xD;
vion of sleep, but for Mrs. Carl there remained a duty which&#xD;
must not be postponed till the morrow, lest procrastination&#xD;
prove the thief of time. IHer unwilling heart    -    -ould fainm&#xD;
the painful task, but that might not be. Indeed, itrn d not&#xD;
be feared, for the suffering woman had become rooted in that&#xD;
integrity of habit, which can march boldly up to an unpalata-&#xD;
ble duty, if not always without trepidation, yet ever without&#xD;
wavering.&#xD;
This sad duty was to pack Walter's sea-chest for the fish-&#xD;
ing-trip. Lie chest had been given to the widow, by a retired&#xD;
fisherman. The latter had received it from veteran salt.&#xD;
This hoary piece of sea-furniture was a relic of by-gone days&#xD;
and looked to have seen much hard service. Its shape was&#xD;
not unlike the kettle-bottomed ships of former times, that is,&#xD;
with tumbling sides, or top narrower than the bottom. It had&#xD;
doubtless received a brushing of green paint every voyage&#xD;
and this, with the accumulating filth or the forecastle, and the&#xD;
gangrenous effect of the bilge-water had  f   ee, a&#xD;

READY FOR SEA.&#xD;

52              THE FISHER BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
coat; of no named color, but retaining an odor which impressed&#xD;
the sense with the very spirit of a sea-going life.&#xD;
For handle, on either end, was a neatly marled rope-becket&#xD;
rove through a firm cleet. The insterstices of the beckets had&#xD;
teen filled with tar, amalgamated with oily sweat from fre-.&#xD;
quent handling, which imparted to it an unnatural rigidity.&#xD;
Indeed, the external appearance of the old chest was very&#xD;
Neptune-like, and bespoke a career of rare vicissitude.&#xD;
On raising the lid a musty void met the eye, except a till&#xD;
for notions in the upper part of one end. The interior had&#xD;
received no painting, unless a slight brushing from the hand&#xD;
of Time might be called such.&#xD;
As the eye of Mrs. Carl fell upon the desolate space, she&#xD;
was reminded of nothing so much as a coffin in which was to&#xD;
be buried her fondest hopes. So intense were her emotions,&#xD;
that it seemed to her distracted sense, the body of her son,&#xD;
instead of his clothing, that she was going to place therein.&#xD;
With an aching heart, the widow began to pack. -Dear&#xD;
reader, were you ever called to a similar office, of preparing&#xD;
with your own hands for the departure,--alas, perhaps forever,&#xD;
of a tenderly loved one, - to yield up your dearest affections&#xD;
upon the Altar of Duty?  Then may you know the anguish&#xD;
of Mrs. Carl.&#xD;
As article after article bedewed with a tear, was carefully&#xD;
folded in, the swelling bosom of the widow heaved with emotions&#xD;
which it seemed impossible for her to control. There were&#xD;
the warm flannels, the woollen drawers, the nippers, the com-&#xD;
fortable mittens, which latterly she had set up night after&#xD;
night to finish, until her very temples throbbed with pain.&#xD;
Then her hand fell upon the fantagic forget-me-not, a gift&#xD;
from sweet cousin, all rosy with the dew of affection. Sev-&#xD;
eral articles of medicine were not forgotten ; such as castor&#xD;
oil, salts and senna, a variety of mint-drops, and a bundle of&#xD;
&#xD;
dried herbs, from thoughtful grandmother. Then came the&#xD;
box of fishing-paraphernalia which it would take pages to de-&#xD;
scribe. And lastly, she carefully laid in a bible, as if this&#xD;
could prove an antidote to her griefs.&#xD;
The chest closed and locked, Mrs. Carl stole into the nar-&#xD;
row bedroom of her son. He was reposing as calmly, as if&#xD;
his future were a placid sea.&#xD;
How beautiful was he to the adoring mother ! A tranquil&#xD;
glow heightened the charm of his fine countenance. Angelic&#xD;
smiles seemed playing upon his sweet features, while upon his&#xD;
fair brow beamed the emblems of truth and purity. How&#xD;
could she give him up ! How resign him to a world filled&#xD;
with snares for the unwary ! Ah, the thought that her off-&#xD;
spring may return to her no. more, - may fall a victim to the&#xD;
disease of clime,-may find a grave in the ocean's depths &#xD;
it is not this that brings the peculiarly fearful sorrow to a&#xD;
mother at parting with a son, for a life upon the sea. It is&#xD;
that her dear boy can never return to her the same pure&#xD;
being that he was ; and that he may come back a foetid wreck&#xD;
from the luring but hideous gales of sin.&#xD;
In the agony of her spirit, the suffering woman knelt by the&#xD;
bedside of her son, and there transfixed by deep emotion,&#xD;
breathed out her faith in earnest supplication. This simple&#xD;
exercise calmed and strengthened her mind. Imprinting a&#xD;
kiss upon his brow, she retired to her own humble cot. But&#xD;
not to sleep. The dread vision of separation pressed too&#xD;
heavily upon her soul for that. Her eyes were set aglare,&#xD;
while hearing grew painfully alive to the faintest echo.&#xD;
When the fevered sense from very exhaustion, sank into a&#xD;
lull, the lunatic brain was peopled with images, that came and&#xD;
went in boding train.&#xD;
At length, the -red chasers of Night heralded t.e approach-&#xD;
ing dawn. *The spirit ridden woman drew herself from the&#xD;

&#xD;
bed, and touched a match to the awaiting fuel. The unstinted&#xD;
breakfast, by the hand of affection, was soon ready.&#xD;
By this, the noise of a wagoner was heard, thundering up&#xD;
to the house. The front door opened and a man groping&#xD;
through the hall, and up the stair-way, entered unceremoni-&#xD;
ously.&#xD;
"Good morrow, mistress Carl," quoth the wagoner ; glad&#xD;
to see you looking so smart, this morning; confess, I didn't&#xD;
expect it; must be hard to let Walter go, but such trials are&#xD;
a part of life, you know, and we've only to put the best face&#xD;
possible upon the matter."&#xD;
Mrs. Carl made no answer, except that a tear gushed from&#xD;
her over brimmed eye, like a pearly dew-drop, trickling upon&#xD;
the leaflets of a shaken flower. She arranged a chair, and&#xD;
pressed the honest wagoner to be seated.&#xD;
"Oh, no, thank ye, can't stop just now. Skipper sent me&#xD;
after Walter's things. The crew'll all be along directly, and&#xD;
one'll stop, and call the boy.- Guess they're going to have a&#xD;
good turn out. 'Tis almost calm now, only a slight air stir-&#xD;
ring at the North, just enough to fan them out of the Bay.&#xD;
In the-afternoon, the wind'll spring up at the So-West ; that&#xD;
is, if t'works as it generally does, and this is just the thing for&#xD;
them, you know, when they get over the shoals. Then off&#xD;
they'll wind afore it, like a skein of yarn. The vessel'll soon&#xD;
be back I'll warrant; colors flying: all salt wet; as lively as&#xD;
a duck, after oiling. Faith, half wish I was going along my-&#xD;
self."&#xD;
The widow heaved a deep sigh and was silent. She merely&#xD;
pointed out Walter's sea-effects --the old chest, already de-&#xD;
scribed, a straw mattress, pillows; two woollen blankets; a&#xD;
quilt; also, the weather gear, such as boots, barvel, oil suit,&#xD;
etc. While these were being taken down stairs, she slipped&#xD;
into the bedroom, and awakened Walter.&#xD;
&#xD;
The boy arose with that mysterious feeling of unreality,&#xD;
that settles upon one, at the fulfilment of a long expected&#xD;
event. While he was seated at the table, the widow made a&#xD;
pretext of going from one room to another, the better to con-&#xD;
ceal from her son, the emotions surging her breast.&#xD;
As to the boy, he felt little inclination -to eat ; and scarcely&#xD;
had he swallowed a cup of tea, before the crew were seen&#xD;
approaching the house, by the Eastern Lane.&#xD;
Mrs. Carl would not trust her feelings in presence of others,&#xD;
and her judgment bid her make the parting scene brief. As&#xD;
her eye fell upon the crew coming, she exclaimed in a tremu-&#xD;
lous voice,&#xD;
"Walter, my son, they are coming.N&#xD;
The boy sprang from the table, seized his hat, and stood&#xD;
motionless before his mother. He appeared waiting for some-&#xD;
thing ; what, he could not tell himself. In fact, his state of&#xD;
mind was quite different from what he had expected. He&#xD;
had looked forward to the moment of separation as one of in-&#xD;
tense tenderness ; but to his amazement there was not the ves-&#xD;
tige of an emotion swelling his heart ; not even the remem-&#xD;
brance of the sentiment so lively in anticipation. Indeed, he&#xD;
seemed struck with a paralysis of soul.&#xD;
But -not so with Mrs. Carl. To her the moment of trial&#xD;
had come. The billows of emotion raged even with deeper&#xD;
power within her bosom. It seemed that her lashed spirits&#xD;
must sink beneath their accumulating force. But the widow&#xD;
possessed a soul of strength. The roots of self-control had&#xD;
struck deeper from the storms of misfortune. It was now no&#xD;
time, she knew, for a scene. A display of feeling might um&#xD;
settle now too late the purpose of her son. It could but tinge&#xD;
with deeper bitterness the sentiment of separation, when he&#xD;
should be away.&#xD;
Stepping forward, and taking his hand in hers, in a sup-&#xD;
pressed voice, she said,&#xD;
&#xD;
THE PARTWG,.&#xD;

56              THE FISHER BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
LEAVING HOME.&#xD;
&#xD;
"My dear son, you are now about to leave me ; remember&#xD;
always your mother; ever do your duty; be true to yourself,&#xD;
to your God; and may Heaven bless you.&#xD;
Pressing her pale lips upon his brow, she accompanied him&#xD;
through the door, and returning, sank into a' chair, giving vent&#xD;
to the anguish of her heart.&#xD;
But there was another farewell for her reluctant eyes; and&#xD;
hastening to the window, she gazed upon his endeared form,&#xD;
until the forests' shades cut him off from view. Her heart&#xD;
now fairly sunk within her. The bright morning settled&#xD;
down upon her vision with leaden gloom. Such a day in all&#xD;
her dark experience, she had never before seen. Would that&#xD;
she might never behold another like it.&#xD;
The- parting thus dimly outlined, but faintly shadows the&#xD;
dark tempest that swept over the ocean bosom of the widow's&#xD;
soul. To an observer, it might have seemed to be bearing all&#xD;
before it. But no, as the gale increased in force, so did new&#xD;
resources of strength leap up, from the well-spring of her ex..&#xD;
haustless nature. Indeed, the noble woman could be com-&#xD;
pared to some gallant barque, lost for the moment amid the&#xD;
rage and fury of the tempest, but seen at length again, di-&#xD;
shevelled it may be in rig, but still careering in proud majesty,&#xD;
upon the now conquered and subsiding waves.&#xD;
This yielding of emotion to reason was the supporting staff&#xD;
of her habitual self-control. Following the thrill of impulse,&#xD;
she could have thrown herself upon the neck of her son, and&#xD;
there sobbed out her spirit in despair. And many a moment&#xD;
of the day, when the sentiment of separation rolled back its&#xD;
hitter waves upon her, she almost repented not having yielded&#xD;
more fully to the exquisite luxury of her grief, as the last&#xD;
drop of happiness, remaining for her in life.&#xD;
As for Nathan, it was some time before he could realize&#xD;
that he had actually set out from home. The parting-scene&#xD;
&#xD;
with his mother floated through his mind, like a passing&#xD;
dream. At length he began to feel the novel sensations that&#xD;
lie at the threshold of a new career. The-raw morning air&#xD;
fell at first with shivering touch upon his delicate system; but&#xD;
soon, the exhilaration of walking, and the comfortable warmth&#xD;
of his rough habiliments - a scotch-cap, neck-comforter, red-&#xD;
baize shirt, thick round-about, trowsers, and cow-hide boots,&#xD;
lent a keen glow to his animal spirits.&#xD;
As already implied, a cart had taken in advance the gene-&#xD;
ral effects of the crew, - such as the sea-chests, upholstery,&#xD;
and fishing-tackle ; still each fisherman circled with his arm&#xD;
a stuffed pillow-case, or bore in hand a bandanna handkerchief&#xD;
crowded to the corners. These were filled with articles of&#xD;
the nicer sort, such as it would not do, to entrust to the rough&#xD;
and tumble of the wagoner's hand.&#xD;
The garb of the crew was unique. It could neither be&#xD;
called the rig of the sailor, nor the dress of the landsman. It&#xD;
had a decided' mongrel aspect, being often like Joseph's coat,&#xD;
of many colors. The patching though rough, was firmly done,&#xD;
and the whole seemed got u3p rather for comfort than grace.&#xD;
A certain brawn figure, with a coarse hardy look, were a&#xD;
fit setting in to the clumsy costume, floating around their&#xD;
limbs. Indeed, they might have been taken for a sort of am-&#xD;
phibious race of beings.&#xD;
Walter lit among them like a bird from another clime. As&#xD;
the boy, soft from his downy-bed of life, made his appearance,&#xD;
each eyed him with a quizzing, incredulous glance, which was&#xD;
followed by a dry, monosyllabic-greeting, that put the boy, it&#xD;
must be confessed, somewhat ill at ease.&#xD;
They spoke no more, till reaching the shore of the bay, but&#xD;
pursued their lagging way, with a gravity befitting beings&#xD;
bound to the realms of Pluto.&#xD;
Leaving home ider any circumstances is little calculated&#xD;

TH1 FISHER BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
VIEW OF THE BAY.&#xD;
&#xD;
to awaken sociality ; especially with a class so taciturn as the&#xD;
fisherman. Then to be turned out of a soft bed of a raw&#xD;
March morning, with so dreary a prospect before, as a fish-&#xD;
ing cruise ! This is indeed dampening to the most buoyant&#xD;
spirit.&#xD;
In respect to the sailor, the case is different. With him the&#xD;
keen regret at parting -from home and loved ones, is accom-&#xD;
panied by feelings that tend to lessen the, bitterness of separa-&#xD;
tion.-such as the kindlings within at the idea of roaming&#xD;
abroad; of looking leisurely around upon the world's broad&#xD;
panorama; of gazing perpetually upon scenes of novelty and&#xD;
interest. These floating before his mind's eye, arouse within&#xD;
him the heroic, and lure his step onward.&#xD;
But not so with the fisherman. No charming hues are re-&#xD;
flected in the blue azure of his prospective landscape. On&#xD;
the contrary, all before him is a dreary waste of waters, --&#xD;
except so far, as the nobTe sentiment of duty, the sweet conso-&#xD;
lation of providing for loved ones; and the anticipation of a&#xD;
happy return, impart buoyancy of spirit.&#xD;
Then, the genuine sailor, he who has become the adoptive&#xD;
heir of Neptune, is never long enough ashore, to become in&#xD;
any full sense wedded to it ; not long enough for the roots of&#xD;
his, briny nature to sink deep into the clinging soil of domestic&#xD;
affection. The sea has become 'his element, the ocean-wave&#xD;
his home ; and one could now no more tame down his roving&#xD;
spirit upon the land, than he could lure thither the wild pin-&#xD;
ion of the sea-gull. It matters nt how tempestuous may&#xD;
have been his last voyage ; how many hair-breadth scrapess he&#xD;
may have passed through ; how often from   the suffering&#xD;
depths of his being, he may have solemnly vowed, his foo)t&#xD;
again upon the dry land, the mountain wave should never&#xD;
wash it more. Still, a few days ashore, and the remem brance&#xD;
of these hardships and resolutions, disappear like the melting&#xD;
&#xD;
track of the parting keel. Old associations like the memory&#xD;
of absent friends, come thronging in upon him, bearing back&#xD;
his restless spirit upon the ocean, whither he follows, if not&#xD;
with alacrity, yet with a regret softened by the power of a&#xD;
controlling sentiment.&#xD;
With the fisherman, the circumstances are quite different.&#xD;
Half of his existence at least is a shore-life. Whatever his&#xD;
luck in the summer, when winter comes, he is sure, like some&#xD;
hybernating animal, to retire into his snug-hole, there to enjoy&#xD;
his little summer-garnered store. This season of sloth begets&#xD;
a lassitude that unbends the very spring of animation, and&#xD;
makes it doubly hard to set off in the early spring for a bleak&#xD;
fishing cruise. It is like transplanting a tree whose fibres&#xD;
are just beginning to embrace the warm, genial earth.&#xD;
The crew stivered along across the gray old fields, yawning&#xD;
in the drowsy morn, then through the secret wood, still hushed&#xD;
in the folds of lingering night ; when winding around the&#xD;
dark-wombed swamp, they burst upon the smiling skirts of&#xD;
the shore.&#xD;
Presently, there glimmered up before them, the stretching&#xD;
chain of fanciful hillocks, scantily verdant with the sharp&#xD;
beech-grass. These formed the pleasing back-ground of the&#xD;
smooth, shelving beach. Through the little vistas formed by&#xD;
the sandy knolls, which the frolicking wind, in some fitful&#xD;
mood had tossed together, duskily gleamed the blue waters of&#xD;
the bay.&#xD;
Upon their verge they were now'standing. It was ahnost&#xD;
calm. A zephyr-like air came creeping from the -hills and&#xD;
wood-land, just enough to ripple here and there the smooth&#xD;
surface of the waters. Save a modest undulation visible in&#xD;
the tiny stir of struggling bits of sea-weed, floating near the&#xD;
shore, the broad bay lay before them, calm and reposing as a&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC8107-00000032"/>&#xD;
THE FISHER BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
sleeping maiden whose snowy bosom from amid her golden&#xD;
tresses, gently swells to the bliss of delicious dreams.&#xD;
Several small craft newly geared and painted, lay quietly&#xD;
anchored at different points some half a mile from the shore.&#xD;
They were sheltered within a sunken sand bar, that stretched&#xD;
all along the coast, and which, in a high wind, formed the&#xD;
only barrier against the spite of the winds that came .galloping&#xD;
in from the Broad Atlantic. Which of these vessels was to&#xD;
be his, Walter could not even guess. But while revolving the&#xD;
matter, his eye fell upon a boat a little way off, turned over&#xD;
upon the sand. By the boat lay strewed a number of articles,&#xD;
and around it were huddled several men in a reclining pos-&#xD;
ture. As our party approached, the others arose and greeted&#xD;
them, but it was done rather by looks than words.&#xD;
At this moment, a fishing vessel at another point of the&#xD;
coast was seen to weigh anchor and make sail..-&#xD;
"Yonder she goes, the Silver Springi, as sure as I'm a liv-&#xD;
ing man," ejaculated one of the crew - a true son of Proteus,&#xD;
one who plumed himself on being always high line, and to&#xD;
whom the bare mention of fish was enough to bring a thrill&#xD;
of anidfiation. " She's got the start of us, after all," he added,&#xD;
"I told our folks 'twould be so."&#xD;
"Well, let her have the start," growled another voice. " The&#xD;
26th of March, is early enough to set out a codding at any&#xD;
rate. There's no need of haste, I fancy. We'll all catch&#xD;
enough cold pig, or I'll be guzzled for a false prophet."&#xD;
"But what have we here," his eye falling upon Walter.&#xD;
"A pretty mother's baby, eh ? Ah, my boy, a hogshead of&#xD;
bitter ale's in store for you. You'd better have nestled be-&#xD;
hind your mamma's apron strings, this many a bright summer&#xD;
yet."&#xD;
These barbed words in a voice of sonorous irony, could not&#xD;
but send a quaking to the spirit of the boy. Looking trem-&#xD;
&#xD;
blingly up, his eyes met the broad gaze of the speaker, whose&#xD;
stalwart frame, overshadowing like a cloud, made him start&#xD;
back with awe. Still, so awakened was his curiosity, that he&#xD;
*could not help scrutinizing the stranger whenever he thought&#xD;
his glances unperceived. The longer he looked, the more he&#xD;
was struck with the figure and mien of the man. He was&#xD;
powerfully built, and his countenance indicated hardy vicissi-&#xD;
tude in the furnace of life. A broad cliest and firmly knit&#xD;
limbs showed him to have seen hard weather in his day, but&#xD;
his still equable air and supple movements, proved that neither&#xD;
age nor suffering, had broken the spirit  nor enfeebled the&#xD;
body. He was not what is termed handsome, yet there lay&#xD;
in his expressive face, a union of strength and tenderness, a&#xD;
kind of manly grace, that might have touched the sentiments&#xD;
of a maiden, but over his boon companions, it exercised a&#xD;
charm all powerful in its influence.&#xD;
The deep tones of Old Marlboro, (for this was the name by&#xD;
which he took pride in being called) blended with a certain&#xD;
racy, domineering ease of manner, proved its usual fascina-&#xD;
tion over the boy, and from the first he could scarcely detach&#xD;
his eye from the graphic sailor. As Walter scanned his face,&#xD;
he thought to read there after all something of human sympa-&#xD;
thy, notwithstanding the withering words just fallen from his&#xD;
lips.&#xD;
The skipper who all this time had been listening in a mus-&#xD;
ing mood, now gave a yawning glance at different points of&#xD;
the heavens; then throwing a wistful look after home; he&#xD;
yet gave briskly the order to go. The boat whirled upon its&#xD;
bottom; and sinewy hands gripping the gunwale, bore it&#xD;
quickly to the water's edge ; the keel on the way but slightly&#xD;
grazing the sand. The movement was an animated one, spring-&#xD;
ing from that vigor, which shows itself in the first effort after&#xD;
,long rest. Here, nicely poised in the water, the stern keel&#xD;

NARROW ESCAPE.                63&#xD;
&#xD;
just touching the shore, their effects were thrown quickly in;&#xD;
and the crew tumbling after, an oar set against the shore,&#xD;
pushed the boat adrift in a trice.&#xD;
Walter now felt the last tie of home sundered; and a mor-&#xD;
tal disquietude sunk upon his soul like a hand of lead. The&#xD;
two stubbed oars, buried deep at each stroke to guard against&#xD;
fracture, were vigorously plied, by some half-dozen muscular&#xD;
arms, while the deeply laden boat moiled its way through the&#xD;
slow yielding water, as if reluctant to proceed upon its humble&#xD;
errand.&#xD;
So nervously cautious had Mrs. Carl always been in expos-&#xD;
ing her last hope, that Walter had never before sailed over&#xD;
the water, even though his home was upon the very verge of&#xD;
the ocean. Accordingly the sensation he now felt was a novel&#xD;
one. It might be likened to the dizzying thrill one has on&#xD;
being poised too high in a swing, increased by the uncomfort-&#xD;
able conviction, that a slip-would precipitate him to the.bot-&#xD;
tom of the sea, instead of landing him upon terra-firma.&#xD;
By the heading of the boat it now became evident which&#xD;
one of the vessels ahead was theirs. She appeared the very&#xD;
smallest of the cozily anchored fleet, and could not have been&#xD;
more -than thirty tons burthen. Her form was that of her&#xD;
class, full at the bow, narrowing at the mid-ships, and taper-&#xD;
ing off like a fish at the stern, which turned up into the air to&#xD;
remind one of the Tritons of old.&#xD;
She was what is termed a pink-stern, a model borrowed&#xD;
very likely from the classic fount of mythology. Why its&#xD;
graceful, airy shape shouldrever have given place to the clum-&#xD;
sy square stern, is without reason, except from the interined-&#xD;
dling of Fashion, which does not always consult Nature in its&#xD;
vagaries.&#xD;
The bristling little, pink with false rails around, and kids-&#xD;
and other like fishing-hamper upon deck, sat squat upon the&#xD;
&#xD;
water, looking as eager to start for the cruise, as a country&#xD;
lad upon his first adventure to the big town.&#xD;
They were at length along-side. The surface of the sea&#xD;
from the shore had appeared perfectly smooth. But as they&#xD;
reached the offing, a long, gentle ground swell became percep-&#xD;
tible. With this undulation the vessel rolled, very slightly,&#xD;
it is true,' but the effect was to toss the boat up and against&#xD;
the vessel, in a style bewildering enough to the unsophisti-&#xD;
cated sense of the Fisher Boy.&#xD;
Being in the bow of the boat, the place always assigned in&#xD;
a sea-going life to the youngsters, he was impatiently ordered&#xD;
by some half-dozen voices to jump on board. He was quite&#xD;
willing to heed the command; and as soon as he could disen-&#xD;
tangle his feet from the pother of fishing tackle, boxes, etc.,&#xD;
that encumbered hin, he fetched a leap, with the view of&#xD;
scrambling up the side of the vessel, and tumbling over upon&#xD;
deck ; but in the flurry, his fingers lost their grip on the rail,&#xD;
and he would inevitably have fallen plump into the water,&#xD;
between the vessel and the boat, but for a vigorous arm that&#xD;
arrested his downward course, and sent him back headlong,&#xD;
over the rail, upon deck.&#xD;
Ere he had recovered the shock of this ill-starred incident,&#xD;
a hoarse, wiry voice broke out -" There, you lubber, a hair-&#xD;
breadth more, and you would have gone sure to Davy Jones's&#xD;
locker, a dainty morsel for some bloody heathen of a shark.&#xD;
Ship on your sea-legs, now, in the twinkling of an eye ; or&#xD;
ten to one you'll be making some other dastardly slip-bend."&#xD;
Glancing over the side of the vessel, his eyes met those of&#xD;
Old Marl. ' They where beaming with a fine gush and twin-&#xD;
kle of delight; while the. furrowed physiognomy of the old&#xD;

64               THE FISHER BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
COAST-SCENERY.&#xD;
&#xD;
weather-beaten son of the sea, despite the rough handling he&#xD;
had received at the old fellow's hands. The force of his last&#xD;
injunction to ship on his sea-legs, now began to press with&#xD;
peculiar significance ; for although the motion of the vessel&#xD;
was not great, the strange, drunken-like sensation it pro-&#xD;
duced upon the boy's nerves, made him quite reel with dizzi-&#xD;
ness.&#xD;
The boat being cleared of her dunnage, was hoisted in upon&#xD;
deck, and turned over the hatch-way. While some began&#xD;
loosing the sails, the skipper gave the order to heave ahead.&#xD;
"IHeave ahead," responded a voice. "Heave ahead, and save&#xD;
the tide," roared another. " Down with the things," squealed&#xD;
out the skipper, to the cook. " Cluck, cluck, rolled round the&#xD;
windlass; up went the main and foresails. The anchor was&#xD;
now a peak. Two or three heavy surges at the hand-spikes,&#xD;
and up bobbed the cable through the horse-pole."  All&#xD;
away, all away," echoed half-a-dozen voices. The jibs were&#xD;
run up at a round. The vessel slowly turned upon her heel,&#xD;
and pointed her prow toward the ocean.&#xD;
"That's quick done," wheezed out a slim voice, sauntering&#xD;
abaftwird, and panting for breath.&#xD;
"Yes," chuckled Uncle Loggy, "many hands make light&#xD;
work."&#xD;
The speaker was a superannuated fisherman, with a pairnoft&#xD;
duck-legs, run into a long lumpy body, 'like a couple of pegs,&#xD;
pushed into an oblong patch of dough. While the rest were&#xD;
getting the vessel under weigh, he, assuming the prerogative&#xD;
of veteran age, had quietly sat upon the combing of the hatch-&#xD;
way,. a critical observer of the varied proceedings.&#xD;
All hands were now busy clearing up decks. Old Marl&#xD;
was the busiest of all. True to his antecedents as a regular&#xD;
salt, he was coiling up, and laying away every rope and bit&#xD;
of yarn, with the nicety of a prim house-wife. " Here, you&#xD;
ELL&#xD;
&#xD;
land-lubber," ejaculated the sailor, to a youngster, who was&#xD;
complacently reclining over one of the kids,&#xD;
Just tumble this batch of rigging down the hole abaft&#xD;
there."&#xD;
As the lad turned away, tugging the huge coil after him&#xD;
the Old Salt added, "You mongrel fisherman have no more&#xD;
knack at keeping a vessel tidy than an Irish collier. A pretty&#xD;
muss the decks 'd be in, but for some one to look after you."&#xD;
While thus getting mder weigh, Walter was in a strange&#xD;
confusion of mind from  the altogether novel and hurried&#xD;
movements around him. Disposed always to be useful, he&#xD;
was skipping about amid the bustle, ready at every one's beck.&#xD;
But the nancouvres of making sail over, he was again free to&#xD;
yield to his feelings. He now found the misty cloud of stu-&#xD;
por, that lay upon his soul on the eve of'parting from his&#xD;
mother, to have dissipated; and the bitter reality of the scene&#xD;
to come creeping in upon his spirit, eke the penetrating&#xD;
drench of a raw east wind. As he gazed sadly upon the land&#xD;
of his home, slowly receding in the distance, his heart swelled&#xD;
within him, and a tear trembled in his eye, like the flickerina&#xD;
of a forlorn hope.&#xD;
Still, these acrid feelings could not override the sentiment&#xD;
for the beautiful in Nature, to which a dove-like life had at-&#xD;
tuned his breast; nor could they destroy the- sweet soothing&#xD;
charm upon the sense, of the lovely scene unrolling around&#xD;
him. *&#xD;
To the westward there stretched the straight line of coast,&#xD;
losing itself in the dim distance. Partially sombred by for-&#xD;
est, it was here and there brightened by some gayly painted&#xD;
building, bespeaking humble thrift. A soft morning haze&#xD;
hung over the land, creating a fantastic illusion, as if the&#xD;
Nymphs of the wood, and the Nereids of the sea were yet busy,&#xD;
weaving their matin love-spells.&#xD;

A couple of miles to the eastward, at the heel where the,&#xD;
pliant coast bends square to the North shoots off south-wes-&#xD;
terly, a spur, in the form of a narrow srip of grassy knolled&#xD;
beach. These two meeting lines of coast, form the deep an-&#xD;
gular bay, enlived in the summer by a variety of craft.&#xD;
On the vanishing point of the beach, plumed in the distance,&#xD;
like a downy sea-gull, was seen the unchanging light-house,&#xD;
to the tempest-tossed mariner the brightest vision of earth.&#xD;
Upon the horizon, hung here and there a white pinioned&#xD;
carrier of plenty, like an angel stooping from heaven. The&#xD;
roving eye would occasionally fall upon an intrepid solitary&#xD;
water-fowl, paddling fleetly over the scarcely ruffled bosom&#xD;
of the deep. These had lingered behind over winter. They&#xD;
might be likened to here and there a mortal whose eccentrici-&#xD;
ties defy the ordinary usages of life.&#xD;
Over the whole, the King of Day, which had just sprung&#xD;
from his briny couch, was flooding his royal beams, warming&#xD;
up the scene to a glowing beauty ; the spirit of which could&#xD;
only be kenned by the eye of the gifted soul.&#xD;
While Walter, reclining over the binnacle, wrapped in the&#xD;
sombre luxury of this melee of emotions, his not unpleasant&#xD;
reverie was broken by a rough voice, bidding him come to&#xD;
the cabin, and look after his things.&#xD;
Going there introduced him to another phase of his new&#xD;
life.&#xD;
In the pink-stern, on account of the narrowness of the&#xD;
stern, the cabin is more conveniently situated in the bow.&#xD;
Nick off the small end of an egg, lay below a narrow floor-&#xD;
ing, with a boxed seat quite around for transom; fasten&#xD;
above this two tiers of shelves, for berths ; run some beams&#xD;
across overhead, to prevent the tumbling in of the roof. In&#xD;
this ceiling set .a thick glass, two inches by three for dead.&#xD;
light. Then at the outlet run up a ladder with -steps instead&#xD;

of rounds, by the side of a narrow, straight fire-place and&#xD;
chimney on one hand, and a mouldy cup-board for dishes on&#xD;
the other; the whole crowned by a wooden funnel, over the&#xD;
chimney, and a little oval house over the gang-way, with a&#xD;
slide meeting, two short thick doors, to close the whole, and&#xD;
you have a semblance of the cabin of the Andes, - a name&#xD;
sufficiently imposing one would think for so tiny a craft as&#xD;
was the Pink.&#xD;
This subaqueous abode comprised a few cubic feet of room,&#xD;
and so low was it, as scarcely to enable the tallest to stand&#xD;
erect. The vessel had not been cleaned in the Fall, but had&#xD;
lain hauled up, on the flats, and there were accumulated the&#xD;
must and mould of a year's gathering. As the motion of the&#xD;
vessel stirred up the bilge-water, the sickening stench thrown&#xD;
up, was enough to appal the stoutest nerves. What, then, to&#xD;
the sensitive taste of Walter, fresh from the sweet life of a&#xD;
soft home.&#xD;
"6Bah, what turkey-buzzard's nest have we here," drawled&#xD;
out Marl, worming his long sides down the gang-way.&#xD;
"Not room enough to swing a cat round by the tail,--a&#xD;
dirty squeeze of it, before we get through, or I'll be hanged."&#xD;
"IHe that's born to be jammed. to death, won't be hung,&#xD;
drawled out a bleareyed fisherman."&#xD;
"Nor be tickled dead at the feet, whimpered a young sprig,&#xD;
perched upon the transom abaft.&#xD;
"Yes, Old Marl, like other big fish, must have deep water&#xD;
to swim in. He's one of your square-riggers, that need an&#xD;
ocean to veer and haul in," gravely exclaimed another.&#xD;
" Tut, tut, squealed the skipper. There's many a worse&#xD;
place in the world. 'Twill be nothing, when you once get&#xD;
used to it. All things come by habit, you know."&#xD;

&#xD;
fireplace, holding a morsel of oakum under some ends of wood&#xD;
with one hand, and using his mouth for bellows, might be seen&#xD;
trying to coax the smothering fire into a blaze.&#xD;
By his side were strown a tea-kettle, a baking pan, and&#xD;
several tin-vessels, all completely imbedded in rust and&#xD;
mould.&#xD;
The first preliminary in setting things to rights in the&#xD;
cabin, was the distribution of berths. By an indisputable rule,&#xD;
the skipper takes the upper birth abaft, on the starboard side ;&#xD;
while the cook, as a matter of convenience, has a lower one&#xD;
by the side of the fire-place. These two sole officers'provided&#xD;
for, -namely, the cook and the skipper, or skipper and cook,&#xD;
rather, the other berths are distributed among the crew by&#xD;
lot.&#xD;
Walter's lot fell with that of a big-bodied man, in one of&#xD;
the narrow under berths. His blowzy companion looked of&#xD;
sufficient volume to fill all the little space himself; and the&#xD;
boy could not but have a strange feeling of disgust at the&#xD;
thought of lying in so dark, disagreeable a nook, with such an&#xD;
animal of a man for bed-fellow, - the more -so, as ever before,&#xD;
he had either reposed in a neat cot alone, or by the side of his&#xD;
gentle, dear mother.&#xD;
"But Fortune turns up for us strange bed-fellows."&#xD;
Scarcely were the berths made up, when the sharp sound,&#xD;
"hard a lee," brought Walter to the deck. The wind, it&#xD;
seemed, had changed just as predicted by the wagoner; and&#xD;
was now freshening in a gentle breeze from the south-west.&#xD;
The vessel had got well off the Point, and was now con-&#xD;
testing it with the stubborn little Cape.&#xD;
"One more short tack, and we'll fetch by," said the man at&#xD;
the helm. - Whereupon, about the vessel whirled, and before&#xD;
Walter could gain a clear notion of their whereabouts,,she&#xD;
was in a position to weather the point all clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
"She works like a well broke steer," mdsed Marl.&#xD;
"Which passage ?" inquired the man at the helm.&#xD;
The inner one," replied the skipper. " Half tide, water&#xD;
enough, start the sheets," he added.&#xD;
The main, fore and jib sheets were eased a little. The&#xD;
wind just at this moment freshened, as if catching the spirit&#xD;
of the scene.&#xD;
While the vessel, seized by the sweeping current, was born&#xD;
around the dizzying point, Walter was thrilled with excite-&#xD;
ment. The scene was as novel as unique. The low distant&#xD;
point of the Cape, at first but a thread in the dim horizon, had&#xD;
now become a present, tangible object. The long, smooth,&#xD;
shelving beach, reaching into the bounding ocean, wound&#xD;
round and round, as if evading solution ; while the gliding&#xD;
panorama of the grassy knolls, the moving light-house, and&#xD;
the walking masts of the vessels in the harbor, the specks of&#xD;
men strolling over the hills, and the sailing gulls dotting the&#xD;
air, but lent animation to the picture.&#xD;
The surface of the water- was broken by boiling eddies,&#xD;
portending dark mysteries below. A little at the south was&#xD;
the dreaded Shovel-full, and further at the east, the long Pol-&#xD;
lock Rip, heaving and cresting at intervals, as if laboring to&#xD;
throw up the bones of ship-wrecked mariners.&#xD;
Clear of the shoals, the sheets were eased fully off, and the&#xD;
vessel's bow kept direct for the Fishing Ground.&#xD;
Another set of preliminaries were now gone through with.&#xD;
The cables were unbent from the anchors, and coiled snugl&#xD;
away down the hold,; the slack of the halyards becketed up&#xD;
to the mast; a barrel of salt clam bait opened; and another&#xD;
lot cast for berths at the rail midships.&#xD;
The skipper took his, by privilege, a-mid-ships. A place&#xD;
over the anchor wa s set -off for the cook. And the rest of the&#xD;
space being divided, was distributed by lot. By good fortune&#xD;
Walter's berth fell by the side of Marl.&#xD;

FIRST DINNER AT SEA.             71&#xD;
&#xD;
"You're as lucky as a colt," chuckled Fishall.&#xD;
"Wgl, why," demanded the sailor, with a look of keen but&#xD;
open inquiry.&#xD;
"Because you've got the boy by your side. He'll be a&#xD;
pretty little tender to keep your lines from fouling," sarcasti-&#xD;
cally reiterated Fishall.&#xD;
"Well, somebody must have the little fellow by him, I sup-&#xD;
pose," muttered Marl, with a tone and air of rebuke.&#xD;
The berths appropriated, each in his own good time, added&#xD;
fixtures according to his liking, -such as cleets upon the kids&#xD;
to belay his line to; a little shelf for prepared bait, and a&#xD;
score in the rail, for the line to veer in. Lastly, the craft was&#xD;
brought up, and carefully put in its place.&#xD;
This useful gear consists of a pair of hooks fastened by&#xD;
gangings to pendants striding either a wooden or marled rope&#xD;
cross-tree. This is bent to a lead for sinker, to which the&#xD;
line is attached. Little iron or horn swivels terminate the&#xD;
pendants, that the entrapped fish may swing round without&#xD;
fouling the craft.&#xD;
When not in use, for the convenience of being portable,&#xD;
the line with the craft is kept wound upon a small hand&#xD;
reel.&#xD;
The hooks daintily filed,'-an art by no means easy, and&#xD;
strung with bits of bait, the lead is laid upon deck,-and the&#xD;
pendants thrown over the rail, when all is ready.&#xD;
"Dinner's ready," shouted the cook, thrusting out~ of&#xD;
the gang-way his greasy face besmeared with sweat and&#xD;
smoke.&#xD;
"Dinner," reschoed the skipper in a lively voice. " Come,&#xD;
boys, let's down, and take a bite."&#xD;
Except the helmsman and one or two of the youngsters,&#xD;
all were in a moment in the cabin. The latter yielding&#xD;
to the sway of the green king, were supinely coiled up&#xD;
&#xD;
under the windass, in total indifference to the turn of theii-&#xD;
fate.&#xD;
Walter felt no disposition to eat, but he was quite willing&#xD;
to follow the rest. As he descended the stairway a new sort&#xD;
of table greeted his eye. It was merely a long piece of pine&#xD;
board planed, with narrow strips nailed upon either side, to&#xD;
guard the dishes against the lurches of the sea. The upper&#xD;
end was set firmly upon two pegs ; while the lower which ex-&#xD;
tended nearly to the steps was supported by a wooden leg. It&#xD;
could be unshipped at pleasure.&#xD;
The cook, or Dunderfish as he was called, pitched upon the&#xD;
table two freighted tin pans; the one filled with boiled salt&#xD;
cod.and potatoes, and the other containing a frugal quantity&#xD;
of pork tried out to scraps. By the side of these, lie added&#xD;
a huge but equivocally baked loaf of rye and Indian corn,&#xD;
bread.&#xD;
Each of the crew now pulled from the edge of his berth a&#xD;
bright tin pan, an iron spoon, and knife, and the attack was&#xD;
commenced silently and in earnest. A few raw onions. spar-&#xD;
ingly eaten, was the only condiment or dessert to the classic&#xD;
repast.&#xD;
Dinner over, each strolled about the vessel, as led by&#xD;
whim. One might have been seen stretched out in his berth,&#xD;
reading an old almanack ; another, sitting upon the comb-&#xD;
ngs of the hatchway, leisurely filing up a string of hooks;&#xD;
while a third, with stub-pipe in mouth, and thoughts bent&#xD;
upon vacuity, was yawning in the sunniest spot to be found&#xD;
upon deck.&#xD;
As for Walter, the tender sentiment for home, waxed&#xD;
stronger, instead of waning in his breast; and, as he noticed&#xD;
with strained eyes the low, narrow beach in the distance,&#xD;
from which they were flying, to grow fainter and fainter, until&#xD;
it disappeared below the horizon, giving place to an illimitable&#xD;

watery waste, a forlorn feeling added poignaicy to his senti-&#xD;

of the vessel, to disguise the tears that were fast blinding his&#xD;
eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
&#xD;
"What care these roarers for the name of King ?&#xD;
SHAKSPEARE.&#xD;
" THERE she blows," shouted Fishall, who had just aroused&#xD;
from an extempore dozing. Drifting forward, yawning and&#xD;
rubbing his eyes, he commenced sweeping the blue expanse&#xD;
through his filmy peepers with the coolness of a naval quarter-&#xD;
master.&#xD;
" Where away I" ejaculated some half-a-dozen voices, spring-&#xD;
ing at the same time to their feet, and rushing forward -for a&#xD;
look.  In fact, the scene was really animating.  Several&#xD;
whales, grampuses, and- lesser 4eviatlians of the deep, were&#xD;
sending up at brief intervals, spoutings in graceful spray, or&#xD;
rolling up their huge shiny sides in evident satisfaction,&#xD;
while the air was enlivened by here and there a clean gannet,&#xD;
or flapping sea-gull, sailing and wheeling through the upper&#xD;
deep, with most airy pinion.&#xD;
Fish there, you may depend on," brightened up Loggy.&#xD;
" Always fish where you see them ar customers."&#xD;
" Shall we come to, and catch a fresh one," asked Fishall,&#xD;
looking inquiringly at the skipper, and seizing the jib-halyards&#xD;
with a motion to let them go.&#xD;
"We'll run a little longer," musingly answered the skipper,&#xD;
who in a stooping posture, was straining his eyes under the&#xD;
main-sail, as if to pierce the future. "We're now only on the&#xD;
edge of the ground."&#xD;
This life appearance upon the water, and in the air around&#xD;
them, sent a thrill of animation through every one on board.&#xD;

THE FISHER BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
The most sluggish clay seemed endowed all at once, with a&#xD;
most marvellous vitality. It brought vividly before them, the&#xD;
very gist of their voyage, -namely, fish-catching.&#xD;
How trivial an affair will often enkindle aglow the human&#xD;
breast. Vaulting ambition is as near being appeased, by the&#xD;
successful sway of a fishing rod, as by wielding the sceptre of&#xD;
empire,-by the catching of a fish, as by the capture of an&#xD;
argosy. How fortunate for man, that humble schemes, as&#xD;
well as grand designs, are alike suited to awaken enthusiasm&#xD;
and inspire action.&#xD;
Judging now the vessel far enough over the ground, he&#xD;
gave the order for coming to. Whereupon down went the&#xD;
jib, and half-a-dozen willing hands at the down-haul fetched&#xD;
it smack and smooth to the bowsprit. The main and fore&#xD;
sheets were eased off, and the helm becketed to the leeward.&#xD;
The lively craft, as if a conscious being, came boldly up to&#xD;
the wind, dashed off the spray from her fore foot, and, after&#xD;
shaking her canvas in the wind, veered off, and commenced&#xD;
a steady drift to the leeward, as if taking up a regular line of&#xD;
conduct.&#xD;
" Chuck, ehuck, chuck," dropped some eight or ten leads&#xD;
over into the water, bearing as many crafts toward the bottom&#xD;
for the first catch of the trip. But Walter was vexatiously&#xD;
behind the rest. It was many a posing moment, before he&#xD;
ventured to let go his lead at all, and when he did come to so&#xD;
bold a determination, he was doomed to deep chagrin ; for the&#xD;
hooks, either eager for capture, or reluctant to leave the deck,&#xD;
caught in the scuppers, and held fast. With much plague&#xD;
disengaged from this, then came the endless unwinding, which&#xD;
made the elbows fairly ache with fatigue.&#xD;
The whole crew, now inspired with hope, were ranged along&#xD;
the vessel's rail. Each crouched forward, with line gripped&#xD;
with nippers in right hand, wrist resting upon rail, and feet&#xD;
&#xD;
planted firmly upon deck, waiting for a jerk back. Mute&#xD;
they were, as if the recognition of abite depended upon hear-&#xD;
ing as well as feeling.&#xD;
"See - see," jerked back Fishall; and in a moment, was&#xD;
hauling in his line with a set gait.&#xD;
" Ah, he's here," chuckled Loggy. " Got him on ?" asked&#xD;
a half-a-dozen voices To this Fishall made no further reply,&#xD;
than setting to more vigorously, as if the matter were too mo-&#xD;
mentous for speech.&#xD;
hooking a fish added to the general ardor. Each now&#xD;
bent lower to the rail, reaching forward his hand with intense&#xD;
expectancy.&#xD;
Presently, a nibble was felt; then, another fish was&#xD;
hooked. Marl was now seen hauling one from the bottom,&#xD;
with his easy, swinging gait ; and, all on board was the liveliest&#xD;
activity.&#xD;
But Walter all this time, was in the sorriest predicament.&#xD;
In the first place, to hold the line at all, against the superin-&#xD;
cumbent weight of the ocean, taxed to the utmost his fragile&#xD;
strength. Then his nippers, not "broke," but increased the&#xD;
difficulty. At every roll of the vessel, the additional strain to&#xD;
his hand left the impression of a bite. And no sooner over&#xD;
this illusion, than there came another -namely, the frequent&#xD;
bobbing of the lead against the bottom.&#xD;
In his confusion of mind, the notion crept in upon him, that&#xD;
it must be a ,fish weighing so heavily upon his line, -per-&#xD;
haps, a couple. Elated with the conviction, he struck at once&#xD;
to hauling up, but the first effort convinced him that the thing&#xD;
was not so easy as he imagined. In fact, he could not at first&#xD;
budge his line at all; but no one coming to his aid, he braced&#xD;
both feet against the bulwark, and laying back with full might,&#xD;
with both hands, he made out at length to start it an inch or&#xD;
two; then fleeting and repeating the process, thanks to the&#xD;

&#xD;
gradual lightening of the weight, he finally succeeded in draw-&#xD;
ing his craft to the surface.&#xD;
The moment he could get breath, he cast an eager glance&#xD;
over the side, to gain a sight of the captives. But how con-&#xD;
founded was he to see no fishes, - but, instead, simply two&#xD;
hooks, -bare, save a shell-fish to one, and a bit of rock weed&#xD;
to the other. As for. the rest, the pendants and gangings,&#xD;
were wound around the cross-sticks, in a pretty snarl.&#xD;
The boy's flushed assurance on starting to haul up, the&#xD;
hero-like pluck, with which lie tugged away so perseveringly,&#xD;
his virgin breast swelling with hope, and as he gained the goal&#xD;
of effort, the proud air of triumph, with which ii features&#xD;
glowed, as he darted his eyes over the vessel's side to greet&#xD;
his prizes,-this, contrasted with the flat dejection that with-&#xD;
ered up his countenance, as the truth gleamed up, gave rise&#xD;
to a broad chuckle from the crew, at so ludicrous a discom-&#xD;
fiture.&#xD;
The snickering of the hands at the ridiculous abortion of&#xD;
this his first attempt at fish-taking, was indeed dampening to&#xD;
the ardor of the boy, but it did not paralyze his ambition. By&#xD;
the aid of Marl to clear his craft, and bait anew his hooks, he&#xD;
was soon again in trim. He once more threw his lead, with&#xD;
animating hope for better luck. Indeed, as the line hobbled&#xD;
over the rail, in its hasty descent, and the glow of reaction&#xD;
suffused his nerves, the spirit of the boy lit up into a blaze of&#xD;
energy he was not before conscious of possessing. It was&#xD;
the exquisite experience of a newly born. True, lie had not,&#xD;
actually caught a fish, but having worsted through the toil, he&#xD;
felt himself on the high road of success. He was at least, im&#xD;
the circle of activity. The chain of lassitude was broken.&#xD;
The future rose up in, buoyant mirage. A manly feeling&#xD;
throbbed his breast.&#xD;
The sun had now sunk below the horizon. The shades of&#xD;
&#xD;
night began to gather round. The biting having ceased, the&#xD;
skipper gave the word broaters,-a term in the fisherman's&#xD;
nomenclature, signifying that all fishes taken after that sound&#xD;
is heard, are not reckoned to the catcher, but confiscated for&#xD;
the general benefit of the voyage.&#xD;
The leads were drawn in upon deck, their catch of fish&#xD;
dressed down, and salted in the hold.&#xD;
" Shall we heave too, now," demanded Fishall. To which&#xD;
the skipper replied, "yes."&#xD;
Accordingly, the jib was stowed, the main-sail furled, the&#xD;
fore-sheets hauled abaft, when the obedient craft stivered&#xD;
along by the wind, just of a pace to hold her ground for the&#xD;
morrow.&#xD;
"Well, the hussy's got on her night-cap, and 'tis well&#xD;
aired," quoth Marl, glancing at the fore-sail, as he stretched&#xD;
slowly his lank sides, down the gang-way. "I hope she'll&#xD;
have a quiet night's rest of it," he added, peering dubiously&#xD;
around the horizon. "At any rate I'm down for a doze."&#xD;
Not many less than a dozen souls, or rather bodies,&#xD;
squeezed into so narrow quarters, as the Pink's cabin, were&#xD;
enough to give an uncomfortable feeling to any one, especially&#xD;
to a novice on board a fishing-vessel, but Walter was fast be-&#xD;
coming used to the straits of his new life ; and just now his&#xD;
spirit was too crushed with painful regrets of home, to be&#xD;
alive to anything in the form of mere inconvenience.&#xD;
The hilarity of the crew, instead of diverting the current of&#xD;
his feelings, only added impetus to their flow. The low jest-&#xD;
ing of these men about the qualms of home-sickness, seemed&#xD;
the very quintescence of mockery. Each jibe went like an&#xD;
arrow against his heart. It swept like the breath of the grave&#xD;
over the blossom of his affections.&#xD;
"We'll take supper," demanded the skipper. Whereupon&#xD;
a couple of huge tin-pans, filled with savory cod-fish chowder,&#xD;

STANDING WATCH.&#xD;
&#xD;
were set smoking upon the table. As the white layers of&#xD;
muscle rolled up above the impregnated water, like coral islets&#xD;
amid a spicy sea, the simple viand looked tempting enough for&#xD;
the dainty palate of a king.&#xD;
The hungry crew did ample justice to the savory dish; for&#xD;
pan full after pan full disappeared in rapid turn. What sep-&#xD;
ulchre more unrelenting than a fisherman's maw !&#xD;
Yet Walter could swallow but a mouthful. A deeper feel-&#xD;
ing than the sense of hunger was reigning within. -Scarcely&#xD;
had Loggy gulped his last mouthful, before the boy who had&#xD;
remained at the table, in gentle deference to his betters, wist-&#xD;
fully sought the deck, for the sweet luxury of solitude.&#xD;
As he rushed -into the night air, all seemed in harmony&#xD;
with his emotions. Yet a species of beauty of a sad and ten-&#xD;
der cast, broke upon his spirit. Night had shut down in dark&#xD;
folds upon the gentle bosom of the muttering ocean. Through&#xD;
the ether of the arching vault, the clustering stars were spark-&#xD;
ling like brilliants set in a canopy of jet velvet. To the fancy&#xD;
of Walter, they were Angel eyes, looking down upon him in&#xD;
sweet sympathy, and discoursing of the deep, yearning affec-&#xD;
tion of a mother's heart.&#xD;
Reclining upon the hatch-way the boy yielded to the tender&#xD;
memories swelling his breast. How strange and unreal seemed&#xD;
to him the rapid scenes of the day, -the startling anticipation&#xD;
that hove up in his breast, the tender parting from his mother&#xD;
-the novel society into which he had been thrown, -the&#xD;
introductory scenes of a fishing-life. Indeed, he could scarcely&#xD;
believe himself the same being that he was the evening be--&#xD;
fore. He seemed to have burst upon a new existence ; and&#xD;
the past already began to mellow off into the back distance,&#xD;
like the dim outline of a receding coast.&#xD;
He was aroused from this soft reverie by a call from the&#xD;
cook to appear in the cabin. He found them setting the&#xD;
&#xD;
watch; and they were discussing with warmth, whether Wal-&#xD;
ter should be called to take his with the rest.&#xD;
He's got to come to it sometime, insisted Fishall, measuring&#xD;
the boy's ability with his own feeling of vigor. He might as&#xD;
well begin first as last. The sooner commenced the quicker&#xD;
over.&#xD;
"My notion is to break in at once. 'Tis the way father&#xD;
served his boys. There was no babying with him."&#xD;
"Yes, yes," squealed Loggy. "I knew your father well.&#xD;
He was a man, every inch of him-high fisherman for twenty&#xD;
years. His boys didn't get any favors, neither at sea, nor&#xD;
ashore; no ship's cousins where he was, and he made men&#xD;
worth something of them all. In fact, boys were good for&#xD;
something in them days, in olden time, when I was young.&#xD;
But what are they fit for now but to eat, and be in the way ?"&#xD;
"You're a set of boobies, to get up such a row about noth-&#xD;
ing," growled Marl. "You'll give the boy time to ship on&#xD;
his sea-legs, won't ye. Let me have his watch, if 'tis such a&#xD;
drug. One would think that nine men could manage a night,&#xD;
without calling on the little fellow. Let him sleep, and dream&#xD;
of his mother, and of the red roses under her window. Grim-&#xD;
faced hardship'll come soon enough, at longest. Then don't&#xD;
thrust his young neck into the yoke, before lie's-strength to&#xD;
wear it."&#xD;
The skipper, always a peace-maker, decided that a watch&#xD;
should be given the boy, but arranged that it should follow&#xD;
his own, so that, in bard or foul weather, he could look out&#xD;
for the lad.&#xD;
Walter felt relieved when the controversy was over. To&#xD;
be the occasion of excited feeling, was extremely painful to&#xD;
his sensitive nature. He felt many misgivings as to his abil-&#xD;
ity to stand watch, but he would undertake any improbability,&#xD;
rather than so fall under the lash of words.&#xD;

Matters settled, the boy flung off jacket and boots, and&#xD;
crawled into his berth. But it was a weary hour, before he&#xD;
fell into slumber. He could not abstract his thoughts from&#xD;
the crowd of emotions thronging his breast. Then his novel&#xD;
situation was by no means soothing to his mind.&#xD;
The water striking against the fore-foot, then gently gurg-&#xD;
ling past, oddly seized his imagination; and when he was&#xD;
wont to fall into a doze, he had the illusion of sinking to the&#xD;
bottom, while the waves closed in whirlpools above him. But&#xD;
Nature, though yielding, never relinquishes her claims; and&#xD;
the boy at length fell firm to sleep.&#xD;
A loud thump before the gang-way, was the first intimation&#xD;
he had of morning. This rough summons twice repeated, was&#xD;
followed by 'all hands a-hoy, up boys, and catch a thousand.'&#xD;
He aroused with a peculiar sense of oppressiveness, from the&#xD;
foul atmosphere he had been re-breathing.&#xD;
A lurid light was faintly struggling from the tin cabin-lamp.&#xD;
The crew, one after another, commenced crawling from their&#xD;
bunks, rubbing their eyes, fetching a low grunt, and appearing&#xD;
as unwilling, as if about being summoned to the executioner's&#xD;
block. Reaching the deck, each, under that talisman, habit,&#xD;
went straight to work without orders. The main-sail was&#xD;
loosed and run up, the fore-sheet eased off, and the craft thus&#xD;
hove to for fishing.&#xD;
There was at first no indication of fishes around. But the&#xD;
habit-ridden crew ranged themselves at the rail, as men fol-&#xD;
lowing the humble bent of routine. There they stood, mutely&#xD;
attentive, as if enveloped in a mixed cloud of doubt and ex-&#xD;
pectancy. Yet the tardy biting gave Walter -leisure to watch&#xD;
the gradual incoming of glorious day.&#xD;
The darkness, that for eight hours had brooded over the&#xD;
fathomless abyss, was fast withdrawing into the bosom of morn.&#xD;
Already the intense blue of the sky began to soften. The&#xD;
&#xD;
sentinel stars that had beamed all night with undimmed lustre,&#xD;
one by one now veiled their faces, as if in modest deference&#xD;
to the approach of an august personage. Steadily, the won-&#xD;
drous transfiguration went on, as if an unseen hand were&#xD;
changing the scenery of the heavens. Dusky Night was be-&#xD;
ing transformed to refulgent Day. Presently, arrows of light&#xD;
began to shoot up along the eastern sky. Soon the entire&#xD;
east was ablaze, filling the whole celestial concave with the&#xD;
inflowing tide of morning light. At length, the everlasting&#xD;
gates of morning were thrown wide open. A bright point as&#xD;
a flash of'lightning appeared. It darted a golden gleam over&#xD;
the waters, and touched with rosy tint, here and there, a&#xD;
fleecy cloud floating airily in the blue azure. It seemed that&#xD;
heaven and ocean were inclining to the salutation of a morn-&#xD;
ing kiss. Ie now appeared in full, the King of Day, spring-&#xD;
ing from his briny couch, with the elasticity of youth, and the&#xD;
splendor of royalty. Rolling in a mantle of effulgence, he&#xD;
climbed rapidly the vaulted arch-way, flinging broadly his&#xD;
cheering rays, and flooding ocean and, heaven with his impe-&#xD;
rial light.&#xD;
To Walter, the scene was glorious beyond expression.&#xD;
He remained for some time rapt in the exaltation of his&#xD;
emotions. His soul seemed lifted to celestial heights, by the&#xD;
grand sublimity of the scene ; while the bursting beauties of&#xD;
day, suffused his faculties with a glow of dewy freshness, that&#xD;
transfixed him motionless with de ight.&#xD;
And what scene in Nature more inspiring with noble emo-&#xD;
tions, than a fine sun-rise at sea. A beautiful sunset may&#xD;
awaken a more pensive feeling of tenderness; but when&#xD;
heralded by Aurora, uplifting the raven 'vings of night, the&#xD;
all benign eye of the universe darts up from below the molten&#xD;
horizon, casting broad around his genial stare, the soul re-&#xD;
ceives a renovation of life, and is raised to heights of grati-&#xD;
tude, inexpressible.&#xD;

UNPLEASANT PROSPECT.            83&#xD;
&#xD;
Meanwhile biting had begun, and was now increasing with&#xD;
welcome pertinacity. The crew warmed into activity gave&#xD;
way with brisk ardor. As for Walter, he had caught one.&#xD;
The successful feat brought a congratulatory shout from all&#xD;
around; and; as the huge fish, drowned stone dead, made its&#xD;
stark appearance to the surface, lightened by being poke-&#xD;
blown, it seemed that the Pates themselves had relented in&#xD;
sympathy for the toilsome hauling up of the boy.&#xD;
"Sate ye," shouted the cook, - the. fisherman's expres-&#xD;
sive call for breakfast. The crew gave a glance in the direc-&#xD;
tion of the sound, but no one, at first, heeded the summons.&#xD;
The feeling seemed to be, that the opportunity just then, was&#xD;
too favorable for securing their end, to justify the losing of&#xD;
time in eating. But in a moment, Marl, planting his lead&#xD;
upon deck, -wringing leisurely his nippers, and attaching them&#xD;
to his line, stalked off toward the gang-way. "I've no idea&#xD;
of starving this poor body, for a few tom-cod, more or less.&#xD;
The devil will get me soon enough at the longest," muttered&#xD;
the salt as he disappeared below.&#xD;
Fishall availing of an unappropriated moment, snatched&#xD;
from the cabin a tin-pan of meal pudding, pork and molasses,&#xD;
with the tail of a fish for rasher. These he conveniently des-&#xD;
patched in the intervals of the line's running. "Make hay&#xD;
while the sun shines," complacently ejaculated the fisherman,&#xD;
smacking his lips at the last morsel, evidently pleased at the&#xD;
thought of having kept so even a race with fast running Time.&#xD;
As for the rest of the crew, each in his own peculiar way,&#xD;
managed at last, to get a bite of breakfast.&#xD;
As the day strode on, the fishes grew more and more vora-&#xD;
cious. They lay flapping and gasping in the kids and upon&#xD;
the decks, wretched victims of man's cupidity. The scene&#xD;
was sadly animating ; and Walter was struck with the relent-&#xD;
less energy with which man pursues his prey.&#xD;
&#xD;
In the ardor of fish-taking, the day sped on, as on eagles'&#xD;
pinions. It was now that early hour of the afternoon, when&#xD;
the sun looks down with fiercest ray. The light morning air&#xD;
had fallen to a calm. The vast ocean lay hushed, like a&#xD;
sleeping infant. The heat came down ablaze. The sky was&#xD;
clear of a cloud, except an ominous haze that was beginning,&#xD;
to gather up in the south-western horizon.&#xD;
"A sure weather-breeder this," portentously muttered Log-&#xD;
gy, glancing toward the north-east, " catching season this,"&#xD;
he added, in a drawling tone, as if listening to what response&#xD;
would come from the rest of the crew.&#xD;
"Polh," sarcastically rejoined Fishall, giving way at his&#xD;
line with redoubled energy, animated very likely with the be-&#xD;
lief of a double game ; and vexed at having to speak at all,&#xD;
amid his glowing enthusiasm for the sport. " Polh, we've been&#xD;
out so long, that I suppose you'd have us run in any way.&#xD;
But since we're on the ground, I'm for catching a fresh mess,&#xD;
at least, so as not to get the laugh upon us."&#xD;
"Who spoke of running in, retorted Loggy, bridling quickly&#xD;
up at such rude snubbing; and that from  Fishall, whom he&#xD;
had sided with but a moment before. I only mentioned the&#xD;
looks of the weather, and the catching season of the year.&#xD;
"Yes, yes, you youngsters are brave enough in fine weather,&#xD;
but when the pinch of the game comes, what are you good for?&#xD;
'Tis an old saying and a true one, that 'know nothing fears&#xD;
nothing.' But as for me, I've had too many brushes about&#xD;
here, to crave any more in my old age. Besides, I'd just as&#xD;
soon my poor old bones would lie at rest in the good church-&#xD;
yard at home, as to be eternally drifting around among these&#xD;
dreadful shoals."&#xD;
These last words fell in so mournful a tone, as to disarm&#xD;
Fishall of all temper for retort. The controversy, besides,&#xD;
was cut short, by a significant look from the skipper, who,&#xD;

84              THE FISHER BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
amiable and yielding to a fault, yet had been too long on&#xD;
board a square-rigger to succumb all dignity, even on board&#xD;
so insignificant a craft as the Pink Stern.&#xD;
The sun in his tireless course had now well nigh reached&#xD;
the western horizon. his face was slightly veiled by frizzly,&#xD;
smoky clouds set deep in the vault, and reaching nearly&#xD;
around the circle of the horizon.&#xD;
The biting having slackened, the skipper gave the word&#xD;
broaters! At once, all leads were drawn in upon deck, and&#xD;
preparations made for dressing down. Each one struck upon&#xD;
his line of duty, like men knowing their parts, and moved by&#xD;
an inward spring to perform them.&#xD;
The idler, as he is called, counted out the fishes each man&#xD;
had caught, and gave him   his tally to -remember.  The&#xD;
throater, after sharpening his knife, drew it across the thi-oat&#xD;
of the fish, ripped down the belly as far as the navel, and then&#xD;
giving a slight cut on each side of the neck, to facilitate break-&#xD;
ing the head from the back-bone, passed it on. The header,&#xD;
seizing the fish in one hand, drew it upon the table -a rough&#xD;
board, with one end fastened into the rail, and the other sup-&#xD;
ported by a- couple of legs to the (leek, -first picked out the&#xD;
liver, to be preserved; and then tearing out the entrails, and&#xD;
jeiking off the head to be thrown away, passed it to his com-&#xD;
panion, the splitter.&#xD;
This latter, who was no less a personage than the skipper&#xD;
himself, after placing the fish against the elect to prevent its&#xD;
slipping, drew his knife the whole length of the fish, cleaving&#xD;
the flesh from one side of the back-bone, then cutting off and&#xD;
ripping out the back-bone, from the navel up, thus performed&#xD;
his part. The idler pitched the splitted fishes into the bold&#xD;
of the vessel, where they were salted in kenches by the&#xD;
salter. ..&#xD;
In this way, the work of dressing down continued to go&#xD;
&#xD;
briskly on. Night had now fairly enshrouded the heavens.&#xD;
Her reign seemed the more complete, because of the dark&#xD;
gathering of the approaching storm. Not a peering star was&#xD;
visible. The gale had not yet begun to freshen, yet its sure&#xD;
on-coming was felt by every experienced fisherman on board.&#xD;
,There are certain premonitions of Nature, that to a mariner&#xD;
at sea, portend a storm with a certainty rarely mistaken.&#xD;
"Thick fish these," at length broke Fishall. Nor' more&#xD;
than three thousand of them for a hundred quintals, I calcu-&#xD;
late.&#xD;
"Yes, if we could only get enough of them," joined the&#xD;
skipper.&#xD;
" Grog," drawled out the cook, thrusting at the same time&#xD;
into the skipper's face, a britanija tumbler, two-thirds filled&#xD;
with a warmmiiiixture of New England rum, water and molas-&#xD;
ses, with a sprinkling of ginger added.&#xD;
" 1Ie1m," grunted the skipper with satisfaction, as he drained&#xD;
the last drop.&#xD;
Ahl, that goes to the right spot," ejaculated Loggy, speak-&#xD;
ing l) for once(, ill oimeth i ng of a hil1 voice, as he quaffed&#xD;
in turn lhis portion Of the exilarating liquid.&#xD;
At last the tumbler was presented to Walter. liehesi-&#xD;
tated. It wa  tihel the dawning period of the Inemperance&#xD;
reform ; and although he had never himself signed the pledge,&#xD;
yet he had become alive to the fearful evil of intemperance,&#xD;
as well as impressed with a sense of its .being the duty of&#xD;
every one to-refrain from the intoxicating cup.&#xD;
"Take a little," urged Loggy, straightening up slowly from&#xD;
the bent position imposed upon him by the duty of tlhroating,&#xD;
and regaining his perpendicular, with as much Caution as one&#xD;
would exercise in taking the crook out of a rusty piece of iron,&#xD;
that he would avoid fracturing.&#xD;
" Take a drop, 'twon't hurt you, I'll be bound. But 'twill&#xD;

&#xD;
thaw th6 numbness out of your limbs, and help shake off the&#xD;
night fog.&#xD;
Walter had begun to experience the dismay that seizes the&#xD;
green hand at sea, in the exposure to ridicule which noncon-&#xD;
formity to established usage on board exposes him. Besides,&#xD;
of a yielding disposition, he had come to the conclusion, with-&#xD;
out reasoning upon the justness of such a course, that he&#xD;
would simply acquiesce in whatever might turn up to be the&#xD;
order of things.&#xD;
In this mood, he put the cup to his lips iitending to sip but&#xD;
a drop, merely for form's sake, but th .first swallow diffused&#xD;
such a genial glow throughout his syst m, that lie quaffed the&#xD;
whole without wishing to stop.&#xD;
" That's you, my brave," shouted the old fisherman, animated&#xD;
to a high pitch ; and groping his hand along in the- dark to&#xD;
feel the cup, in order to make sure that the boy had actually&#xD;
finished the dram. " That's you."  Away with all this ashore&#xD;
fol-de-rol, that I'll warrant they've been stuffing you up with.&#xD;
Stick to your fishing-gear, and you'll come out a man yet."&#xD;
" Temperance lectures," he continued, "may answer well&#xD;
enough for -parsons and their deacons to tom-fool the women&#xD;
folks at home with, especially when these sancties have a&#xD;
plenty of the critter in their cellars, in the shape of good Old&#xD;
Madeira; but 'tis shabby doctrine for the poof fisherman,&#xD;
standing cold and wet all day long at 'the rail-- and ten to&#xD;
'one having to dress down in the night,- At such times, a drop&#xD;
or two now and then seems to go to the right spot, and put&#xD;
new life into a man. They prate about its being bad for the&#xD;
health, shortening life, and such sort of fandangos ; but I don't&#xD;
see any 'so strong constitution men now-a-days, as used to&#xD;
be when I was young, and then every vessel that sailed for&#xD;
the banks, took along at least a dozen barrels of New Eng-&#xD;
land rum, besides a ten gallon keg full for each of the crew."&#xD;
&#xD;
This extraordinary effort of the old fisherman, so in disa-&#xD;
greement with his customary taciturn mood, seemed to arouse&#xD;
the crew from the -lethargy which incessant work, and the&#xD;
chilly air had induced, and for a little while, there was a lively&#xD;
badinage going around, at the expense of shore occupations in&#xD;
general, and temperance societies in particular.&#xD;
All this was far, however, from dissuading Walter that in-&#xD;
temperance is not a gigantic evil. Still, the boy in his nar-&#xD;
row judgment could not help but feel, that there lies after all&#xD;
a difference between theory and practice ; and although a pic-&#xD;
ture as true as startling may be drawn of the monstrous vice&#xD;
of drinking, still, when of a gloomyT night, wet, chilled, and&#xD;
drooping with fatigue, the spirits sunk to gero, a little warm&#xD;
mixture may have the effect to revive the sinking spirits;-&#xD;
falling upon the feelings like the grateful tones of a congenial&#xD;
acquaintance, which dispels the clouds of dejection, brooding&#xD;
over the soul of a dreary day of life.&#xD;
At length came from the table the lively sounds of the&#xD;
splitter's knife, accompanied by the following solo,&#xD;
"Always more. and never less,&#xD;
Every time we come To dress."&#xD;
The intelligence sent a thrill of gladness to every breast,&#xD;
such, indeed, as few landsmen can conceive.&#xD;
The dressing tables were now unshipped and stowed away,&#xD;
with an alacrity known only to willing hands. Then came&#xD;
the rinsing of the kids, and scrubbing and washing of the deck&#xD;
of its gurry, a matter' of but a moment's time, with the abund-&#xD;
ance of water, so accessible from the briny fount of Neptune.&#xD;
This done, each made personal ablutions which were&#xD;
copious, thanks to oil clothing, then just coming into vogue,-&#xD;

&#xD;
fisherman. As brief as was the interval that had transpired,&#xD;
the salter had thrown the last handful upon the fish, and was&#xD;
now upon deck, briskly washing off with the rest.&#xD;
The wind, which had been veering round to the south-east,&#xD;
against .he sun, began gradually to freshen. The dark, chilly&#xD;
air seemed instinct with the spirit of a terrific storm. A vague&#xD;
sense of this crept over the soul of each fisherman on board,&#xD;
but it found no utterance, save in a certain ominous silence,&#xD;
that reveals often with more significance than mere words.&#xD;
Danger at sea ordinarily lends no tongue to the seaman. A&#xD;
certain grave, portentous air is the nearest expression to trepi-&#xD;
dation that he commonly evinces. Men by grappling with&#xD;
the elements, lose, for them, by degrees, superstitious rever-&#xD;
ence. It may be that the conviction of being ushered sud-&#xD;
denly upon ,the brink of eternity -in the very presence of&#xD;
Deity, strikes the soul with an awe so profound, as to seal for&#xD;
a time, the fountains of speech !&#xD;
The last little duty was to run up in the rigging the ship's&#xD;
big lantern, the fisherman's star of hope against collision 'at&#xD;
sea. The light being well guyed out, one after another of the&#xD;
crew dropped below, with an appetite clamoring for supper.&#xD;
The repast on this evening consisted oft boiled fish, with one&#xD;
other dish quite common at that time.&#xD;
This, in the fisherman's expressive language, was termed&#xD;
squeal. It was no more nor less than water gruel sweetened&#xD;
with molasses, except that there were added little lumps of&#xD;
dough boiled in, termed dodgers, a soubriquet not altogether&#xD;
inappropriate, since from their greater specific gravity, they&#xD;
naturally sank,.requiring as great a degree of skill to fish&#xD;
them up from the bottom of the dish with the spoon, as it&#xD;
would to hook a dainty tom-cod from the depths of the sea.&#xD;
It may be observed that supper was preceded by another&#xD;
allowance of grog. The only distinctive.feature in the cere-&#xD;
&#xD;
mony of drinking this time was, the accompaniment of a pithy&#xD;
toast. " Here's to wives and sweethearts," said the skipper,&#xD;
as he raised the cup to drink ; then, as the last drop was sip-&#xD;
ped, his lips involuntarily smacked, as if the delicious senti-&#xD;
ment had imparted additional zest to the sweet draught.&#xD;
Round went the cup, each monotonously repeating the&#xD;
homily, except the bachelors, who very complacently changed&#xD;
the sentence to "sweethearts and wives."  When Walter's&#xD;
turn came, he faltered. The language shocked his sensibili-&#xD;
ties. He was about drinking without giving the toast, but&#xD;
Fishall interfered, and declared that he should give it. The&#xD;
boy, to end the matter, made the attempt, but foundered in the&#xD;
effort from the trepidation of sheer modesty. The scene&#xD;
brought a hoarse chuckle, at the expense of the boy's better&#xD;
feelings. .&#xD;
Supper over, the skipper picking thoughtfully his teeth for&#xD;
a moment, with a fish-bone, pulled out a manuscript book,&#xD;
having an ample duck cover. This was so dingy as to war-&#xD;
rant the belief of its having served a like purpose for several&#xD;
fishing-seasons, and had, at last, been transformed from an old&#xD;
body to a new one, as a reward for faithful service.&#xD;
He began writing in it the number of fishes caught by each&#xD;
man opposite his name, taking always the catcher's word for&#xD;
accuracy.&#xD;
" Strange life, eh, boy," remarked Loggy, observing Walter&#xD;
to look with an air of curiosity.&#xD;
"I was thinking," replied Walter, "what that book can&#xD;
have to do with the business of our voyage."&#xD;
"Why, oh, that is the fish account book, and an important&#xD;
book it is too. If it were lost, the voyage could not be settled&#xD;
fairly."&#xD;
" How so," observed Walter.&#xD;
"Well, well," stammered Loggy, "I don't know that I can&#xD;

&#xD;
explain all about it clearly; but the skipper can. He's got&#xD;
the learning, - Poor I, never went to school but one win-&#xD;
ter."&#xD;
The skipper began-  The footing up of the columns shows&#xD;
not only the aggregate of fishes taken on board, but the rela-&#xD;
tive number taken by each man. The settlement of the voy-&#xD;
age usually takes place in the winter, and is done in this&#xD;
wise:&#xD;
From the gross stock is first subtracted the general ex-&#xD;
pense. One fourth of the residue, is set off as the vessel's&#xD;
earnings. Then there is taken out one eighth for the shore-&#xD;
man for curing the fishes, and one sixty-fourth for the skip-&#xD;
per's privilege. The residue is then divided among the crew&#xD;
according to the number of fishes'each one has taken. From&#xD;
the gross share of each, subtract his personal expense, and&#xD;
you have the clear make of each man.&#xD;
The account of fishes taken, all, save the watch, threw them-&#xD;
selves into the berths, for a night's rest. Walter drooping&#xD;
from effort and exposure, soon forgot his memories in the&#xD;
oblivion of sleep.&#xD;
He was awakened some time in the night by the brusk&#xD;
movements of his bed fellow. Springing up, he found the&#xD;
crew hastily drawing on their oil clothes, and confusedly fum-&#xD;
bling up the gang-way.&#xD;
As soon as he found himself able, he mechanically followed.&#xD;
But no sooner had his feet touched the cabin floor, than he&#xD;
felt the vessel to be pitching in desperate energy ; and as his&#xD;
face met the midnight air, he was struck nearly with suffoca-&#xD;
tion, by the fierce confusion of the elements. The gusty wind&#xD;
came, as if winged by a mad fury. It shot the large, pitiless&#xD;
drops of rain in blinding hate. The thick darkness was re-&#xD;
lieved only by the crested waves, that lay thickly on the&#xD;
lashed deep, like startling phantoms. The vessel seemed&#xD;
&#xD;
A "SO-EASTER."&#xD;
&#xD;
91&#xD;
&#xD;
agonizing with the infuriated elements. The scene struck&#xD;
Walter with fearful dismay. Indeed, he could only shut his&#xD;
eyes in very vertigo of soul, at some desperate plunge of the&#xD;
vitalized craft; or dodge below, as some supermaddened bil-&#xD;
low surcharged the deck with its foamy spite.&#xD;
The practised hands of the crew, nerved with energy, soon&#xD;
brought the vessel to a double-reefed foresail. The over-&#xD;
tasked jade now labored more easily, and the crew retreated&#xD;
to the cabin.&#xD;
"A screamer, this," observed Fishall. "No fish to-mor-&#xD;
row."&#xD;
"Nor is that the worst of it," added Marl. "For if the&#xD;
wind should whip round to the north-east, as it often does in&#xD;
such gales, we're in no comfortable situation, away down here&#xD;
between Nantucket shoals and Chatham bars. These shoals&#xD;
are savage customers. They've taken the live oak keel out&#xD;
of many a stauncher craft than this little hooker."&#xD;
"But So-casters are generally short-winded, especially&#xD;
when, like this, they come butt-end foremost," observed Log-&#xD;
gy. This pertinent remark of the Old Fisherman, seemed to&#xD;
tranquillize the rest of the crew ; for each returned to his berth&#xD;
without further conversation.&#xD;
The boy had become so electrified by the harrowing tumult&#xD;
of the gale, that it was now many-a feverish moment, before&#xD;
his startled senses could be tranquilized to sleep. But when&#xD;
he did sink beneath the wave of slumber, the whistling wind&#xD;
through the cordage, and the wild tossing of the vessel, only&#xD;
came as a wafting lullaby ; for when he awoke, he found&#xD;
benignant day had already beamed, and the morning far ad-&#xD;
vanced.&#xD;
The watch seated upon one of the chests in the cabin, wore&#xD;
a doleful face ; while the cook after having persevered vainly&#xD;
to knock up a fire, had at length hopelessly abandoned the&#xD;

&#xD;
attempt. He was now beguiling the time, in giving utterance&#xD;
to many a plaintive anathema at the unlucky turn of his stars.&#xD;
All hands were now called to wear ship. The crew promptly&#xD;
mustered, but with a shivering, reluctant movement, as if in&#xD;
mortal dread of the very touch of exposure.&#xD;
As Walter, the last one up, reached the topmost step of the&#xD;
gang-way, the wild sublimity of the scene without, burst upon&#xD;
his frenzied gaze, like the breaking forth of a new creation.&#xD;
Its terrific grandeur, while it struck with awe, elevated the&#xD;
soul to a height of giddy entrancement. The wind which had&#xD;
veered square to the north, was still blowing a furious gale.&#xD;
The deep, dark curtain, that during the night had completely&#xD;
canopied the sky, had been wildly rent by the storm king, and&#xD;
the fleecy fragments were now being rolled in -deep moving&#xD;
masses, as if quivering in the breath of old Boreas himself.&#xD;
The sea, under the pressure of the gale, was lifted to moun-&#xD;
tain heights, and the fierce aspect of the crested, ridgy waves,&#xD;
lent an intense thrill to the emotion of the beholder. '&#xD;
As for the tiny vessel, she reeled and tossed amid the tu-&#xD;
multuous surges of the upheaving deep, as potentless as an&#xD;
egg-shell upon the surface of a boiling caldron.&#xD;
What scene of earth compared to the sublimity of a storm&#xD;
at sea? How profound and intense the emotions it awakens !&#xD;
Here, the very finger of Deity seems to move in wrathful&#xD;
power before the eye, and the soul involuntarily cowers into&#xD;
self-insignificance, in presence of such irresistible might.&#xD;
Wearing ship at sea is a critical evolution. To the excited&#xD;
vision of Walter, it magnified to one of imminent peril. But&#xD;
there seemed no other alternative ; for continuing their pres-&#xD;
ent tack,_ would inevitably cast them upon the relentless shoals&#xD;
under their lee, clamoring for victims.  Accordingly, each-&#xD;
took his part of duty, as men left to no choice.&#xD;
An experienced hand took his place at the foremast, an .1&#xD;
&#xD;
laid the fore peak halyards clear for running. Another stood&#xD;
,ready at the fore-sheet. The skipper then unbecketed the&#xD;
tiller, and steered the vessel cautiously around upon the other&#xD;
tack.&#xD;
As the bow of the obedient craft fell off from the sea, her&#xD;
motion rapidly increased, as if by some unseen agency. And&#xD;
when she got in the position directly before the wind, what&#xD;
with the herculean force of the gale, and the powerful surg-&#xD;
ings of the sea, she rushed with a momentum absolutely diz-&#xD;
zying. At this moment the fore-sheet was hauled in flat, and&#xD;
as the peak flew over, both it and the peak halyards were al-&#xD;
lowed to fly. As the ropes veered with lightning swiftness&#xD;
over the elects, it sent a thrill of trepidation to the boy, that&#xD;
for the moment nearly stopped his breath.&#xD;
A vessel was now decried near them. The sight sent a&#xD;
gleam of gladness to every breast. To Walter it seemed a&#xD;
star of Hope. It lifted suddenly the cloud of despair brooding&#xD;
over his feelings, as a flash of lightning glimmers amid the&#xD;
surrounding darkness. What more cheering than the sight&#xD;
of a vessel at sea? Especially in a storm is the blessed&#xD;
vision like the warm grasp of a friend in adversity. Droop-&#xD;
ing courage is suddenly revived. Even death itself is less&#xD;
bitter, when we share the dread fate with fellow mortals.&#xD;
, But the oilier vessel seemed to Walter to be in the most&#xD;
distressed-condition possible. She pitched and rolled in ap-&#xD;
parent helplessness. At one moment reeling like a drunken,&#xD;
man, with topmast verging to the water's surface, then despe-&#xD;
rately raising her prow, as if about to make madly a final&#xD;
plunge.&#xD;
At the next moment, she would recede off into a hollow,&#xD;
between two mountain seas, when nothing but the top of her&#xD;
masts could be seen, giving belief that she was settling down,&#xD;
down, to the bottom of the great deep, never more to rise.&#xD;
&#xD;

94                  THE FISHER -BOY.&#xD;
Then of a sudden she would rise swiftly up to the ridge of a&#xD;
mammoth wave, as if capricious Ocean had relented his late&#xD;
purpose, and was now going to toss the tiny craft to the brow&#xD;
of heaven.&#xD;
Walter was not aware that his own vessel was making all&#xD;
the time precisely similar antics, -that what he beheld was&#xD;
in fact, merely one of those striking marine illusions, which,&#xD;
like the deceptive visions of life, present vividly to us the&#xD;
dangers and irregularities of others, while weremain blind to&#xD;
the incongruities of our own life.&#xD;
As one after another of these huge seas, or old sows, as&#xD;
Loggy called them, paid their unwelcome compliments to the.&#xD;
fragile craft, the shock sent a thrill of terror to the breast of&#xD;
the boy. At length there appeared a monster of the species.&#xD;
It rushed on bristling and foaming like a maddened war&#xD;
charger. It struck the vessel so ponderously, as to sweep.the&#xD;
decks, and pour down the cabin in engulfing streams.&#xD;
A momentary dizziness passed athwart the brain of the&#xD;
boy, followed by a leaping of spirit to know the worst. The&#xD;
tremendous shock, the helpless position of the vessel, and the&#xD;
cry from the watch, that all had gone by the board, brought&#xD;
every man with a bound from his berth; and when the stream-&#xD;
ing deck, the naked s-tanchions, like trees after a sweeping.&#xD;
fire, broke to view, an exclamation of dejection was upon&#xD;
every lip.&#xD;
But there was no time to bewail misfortunes that were past&#xD;
remedy.  The only alternative seemed to be, to get the vessel&#xD;
back upon the other tack, and await the more regular forming&#xD;
of the sea. To men emboldened by peril, decision is but&#xD;
action. Accordinmgly she was changed.&#xD;
The vessel now labored in less peril. As mental commo-&#xD;
tion subsided, the gnawings of hunger began to be felt. With&#xD;
the more veteran of the crew, this inexorable demand of Na-&#xD;
&#xD;
IN PERIL.95&#xD;
ture actually became clamorous. And well this might be,&#xD;
since they had tasted nothing to stay appetite for twenty-&#xD;
four hours. After due search, the most that could be mus-&#xD;
tered, was a junk of raw fat pork, and a remnant of corn and&#xD;
rye bread, that had shared the general fate of being duly&#xD;
soaked in the briny water, with which they had been of late&#xD;
so copiously visited.&#xD;
A few of the less dainty munched of this repast, to appease&#xD;
the keenness of appetite. But to Walter such extremity but&#xD;
deepened the cloud of his feelings, by recalling pictures of&#xD;
starvation at sea.&#xD;
As soon as it was deemed safe, the tack of the vessel was&#xD;
again changed. She now lay in tolerable safety-; but the&#xD;
niight was confessedly the most trying one ever experienced&#xD;
by the crew. The Piik continued to ship water frightfully.&#xD;
In spite of the repeated working of the pumps, the water at&#xD;
times gained over the cabin-floor most alarmingly. Thide cord-&#xD;
age and sails, neither new nor strong, and so long exposed to&#xD;
the strain of the elements, were continually giving way at&#xD;
some point. Thus all hands had often to be called, and as&#xD;
often to receive a drenching from the spiteful spray.&#xD;
To be roused smoking with warmth from one's cot, into the&#xD;
chilly air, just as his eyes begin to be wearisome with sleep,&#xD;
is not the most agreeable.&#xD;
Their woollen clothing soaked in brine, chafed their skin&#xD;
to pimple soreness. Indeed their suffering, mental and physi-&#xD;
cal, rose to its culmination. They passed through that intense&#xD;
period, when the sensibilities are most lively, and the tenacity&#xD;
of life the strongest. Later, the nerves become dulled, and&#xD;
the hold upon life weakened. This, however, is but the&#xD;
kindly hand of Nature, soothing the journey to another life.&#xD;
-As to Walter, the heavings of his spirit were little less&#xD;
tumultuous than the tempest-tossed ocean. .The din of the&#xD;

&#xD;
jarring elements, instead  of paralyzing  his sensibilities,&#xD;
aroused his faculties to intense liveliness. He was up at&#xD;
every turn-out, active with the rest, although his inexperi-&#xD;
ence did not permit him to afford that aid which his will-&#xD;
ing breast prompted.&#xD;
But the sullen night at length wore away, is if turning&#xD;
upon the hinges of despair ; and when benignant morn was&#xD;
heralded in the east, it lifted a cloud from every soul.&#xD;
The gale rose to its height about midnight; after which the'&#xD;
lulls grew longer, while the gusts became less fierce. Late in&#xD;
the afternoon, the wind had moderated to a stiff, whole sail&#xD;
breeze. But as the sea still ran dangerously high, the time&#xD;
was employed in repairing as best could be, the damaged sails&#xD;
and rigging. In the afternoon, the wind having got to the&#xD;
south-west, all canvas was thrown to the breeze, aind the ves-&#xD;
sel's bow turned joyfully toward land.&#xD;
The decks were soon strown with wet clothes, and, as the&#xD;
gale moderated, the sea went down like a spent horse. The&#xD;
cook now called out supper. All hearts bounied with grate-&#xD;
ful joy, forgetting in the glow of the present, the miseries of&#xD;
of the past., Such is life upon the ocean-wave!&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER VIL&#xD;
"1Oh ! what can sanctify the joys of home,&#xD;
Like hope's gay glance from ocean's troubled foam."&#xD;
BYRON.&#xD;
"PRiZE 0," ejaculated Fishall, bounding with excitement.&#xD;
"Where away," shouted several voices, while as many of&#xD;
the crew rushed around the alert fisherman, straining their&#xD;
eyes in quest of the descried object.&#xD;
"Dead whale, by jingo, believe so, faith; lucky dogs, ain't&#xD;
we, a voyage right here in the beginning. Skipper, shall we&#xD;
throw out the boat?" hurriedly exclaimed Fishall, almost&#xD;
breathless with interest, and absolutely deaf to the incoherent&#xD;
voices of the crew.&#xD;
"Better wait, and see if 'taint a-mermaid," drawled Loggy,&#xD;
with a droll leer. "Youngsters' eyes are apt to magnify,&#xD;
'specially in the filmy morning."&#xD;
Curiosity was aglow. Each took his turn at guessing out&#xD;
the unknown object. But the vessel coming up with it, re-&#xD;
vealed the truth. It proved a five-handed fish-boat, drifting&#xD;
bottom up, at the mercy of winds and waves. The spectacle&#xD;
was a sad one ; for it was probably but the emblem of death.&#xD;
Its crew must have been lost in the gale. Still, it must be&#xD;
confessed that the commiseration felt for the untimely fate of&#xD;
perished fellow- mortals, was partially overridden by the near&#xD;
prospect of gain. How deplorable that the noble sentiments&#xD;
of humanity should ever be sullied by the greed of getting.&#xD;
The sea had calmed down to a rippling mirror. The ves-&#xD;

&#xD;
a modest wave at the fore-foot, which tumbled over in foam,&#xD;
under the lee, but at windward pencilled along in a gentle&#xD;
ripple as far as the main-chains, where it turned off in a beau-&#xD;
tiful angle, still travelling with the vessel, as if reluctant to&#xD;
part her company.&#xD;
Chatham lights plumed up ahead, a two fold gift of wel-&#xD;
come and warning to the mariner ; while across the narrow&#xD;
beach, the main-land mellowed in dim outline. The sweet&#xD;
sight awakened irrepressible emotions of gladness in the&#xD;
breast of Walter. It was the visible link in the golden chain&#xD;
of home ; and the sentiment was rendered more tender by the&#xD;
mellowing halo of distance and suffering.'&#xD;
This feeling arose to rapture by the appearance of some&#xD;
vessels which, having rounded the tiny point, were spreading&#xD;
their snowy canvas to the auspicious gale, and winging their&#xD;
blithesome way over the proudly swelling wave, directly&#xD;
across the fore-foot of the Pink.&#xD;
These bright links of association brought home to his&#xD;
breast, with an ecstatic thrill, the golden picture of childhood.&#xD;
Indeed, they were the eye-touch of return ; the hand-grasp&#xD;
after painful absence.&#xD;
As they approached, several market smacks appeared&#xD;
snuggled within the bars, and the men looked active at their&#xD;
lines.' This, and the tide having just made ahead for going&#xD;
over the Shoals, it was agreed to tarry a.few hours as well, if&#xD;
but to make a catch to take home fresh.&#xD;
Accordingly, the cables were bent, and the little vagabond&#xD;
of a Pink came to for a trial. The crafts were thrown with&#xD;
flushed hopes for brisk sport at catching.&#xD;
But either from over daintiness, on the part of the little&#xD;
autocrats below, or for .some other 'equally cogent reason, not&#xD;
a bite perched upon their ill-starred fortune for a long tedious&#xD;
hour. A consultation was held, and in the hustle of opinion,&#xD;
&#xD;
PROSPECT OF A GALE.&#xD;
&#xD;
99&#xD;
&#xD;
it came uppermost that fresh bait must be the desideratum.&#xD;
A boat was despatched for some at a neighboring vessel. It&#xD;
soon returned with partial success. Still with this, there was&#xD;
no biting. It now became evident that they were not over&#xD;
favorable ground, but rather than change the vessel, they&#xD;
availed of the happy suggestion of manning the prize-boat for&#xD;
a trial excursion. The opinion proved correct, for no sooner&#xD;
had the boat anchored near the bars, than the biting com-&#xD;
menced, and continued steadily through the day.&#xD;
Toward night, the wind, which had fallen to a calm, sprung&#xD;
up from the north-east, continually freshening. At the same&#xD;
time, a heavy cloud-bank was seen lying around the western&#xD;
horizon, and appearances seemed to bode another gale.&#xD;
"Breeding another storm," muttered Loggy, after many an&#xD;
ominous glance over the water and around the horizon.&#xD;
"Second part of the same tune, I'll warrant," he added, with&#xD;
growing boldness. "Better get over the shoals 'fore night,&#xD;
hadn't we, skipper -catching season, this.  For one, I&#xD;
shouldn't like another such a brush."&#xD;
The skipper falling in with the opinion of Loggy, the an-&#xD;
chor was weighed, and after making signals to the boat, they&#xD;
squared away toward the point.&#xD;
The movement was noticed on board the boat; but the bit-&#xD;
ing being brisker than ever, Fishall, who swayed a tacit com-&#xD;
mand, was too absorbed in the catch, to heed the call at the&#xD;
moment. Indeed, a kind of illusive enthusiasm seemed to&#xD;
throw a binding spell around every one ; and, as one fish after&#xD;
another came over the side, light fingered sport managed to&#xD;
wheedle them of the fleeting moments, until the vessel had&#xD;
faded in the distance, and the sun was fast sinking below the&#xD;
threatening cloud rising in the west.&#xD;
What had best now be done ? To essay overtaking tbe&#xD;
vessel were idle. Doubling the point alone would lock them&#xD;

CROSSING THE BARS.            101&#xD;
&#xD;
fast in the arms of night, and expose them to incalculable&#xD;
perils; especially should the sudden lowering storm in the&#xD;
sky open its bowels of fury at an early hour.&#xD;
"I'll tell you what we'll do," said Fishall, brightening with&#xD;
the sheen of heroism, "We'll cross the bars."  This was&#xD;
received by the rest with a look of doubt, but no one ventured&#xD;
a reply. Marl threw a significant glance at the line of break-&#xD;
ers, just then combing near them, as if in defiance; but the old&#xD;
salt carried too much of the daring in his spirit to be out-&#xD;
braved by a mere fisherman.&#xD;
Fishall was not, by nature, overstocked with pluck. But in&#xD;
this instance, the energy aroused by the novelty of power, and&#xD;
the enthusiasm fired by a good catch, had, for once, awakened&#xD;
something corresponding to heroism in his breast. Possibly&#xD;
the gladdening view of home added its influence.&#xD;
Chatham bars are a congeries of hidden sand-bars, com-&#xD;
mencing somewhere off the middle of :Cape Monomoy, run-&#xD;
ning parallel with the shore, and reaching to Chatham lights.&#xD;
Exposed to the full rake of the Atlantic, the waves break&#xD;
upon them with fearful cresting, especially amid a gale, and&#xD;
even after its force is spent. Their dirge-like roar may be&#xD;
heard of a still evening for miles in the inland.&#xD;
Walter himself had often listened in childish wonder to&#xD;
their-wailing lullaby, not dreaming that it was to be one day&#xD;
his lot, to cross them in an open boat. Thus short is our ken&#xD;
of the future!&#xD;
Mariners hold a mental dread of these sand-bars, as of all&#xD;
others in their neighborhood, and to seamen not familiar by&#xD;
experience with their relative position, their veryname brings&#xD;
dismay to the stoutest heart. Hence, vessels never fail of&#xD;
doing them the homage of a wide berth. Their not being&#xD;
ll known, may account somewhat for the awe that envelops&#xD;
them; since acquaintance with danger tends to ameliorate the&#xD;
&#xD;
sentiment of terror, which danger at a distance rarely fails to&#xD;
beget. But let that be as it may, a certain mysterious awe&#xD;
continues to hang around these remorseless death-beacons!&#xD;
Even Fishall, whose youth had been spent in boat-fishing&#xD;
and who was as familiar with every nook of coast thereabouts,&#xD;
as the finny tribes that periodically scour its sandy shores, had&#xD;
never ventured across Chatham bars. That he should have&#xD;
the boldness to do it now,-might seem inexplicable, save by&#xD;
remembering that a bold rashness sometimes springs up in a&#xD;
timid soul, as the wildest tornadoes not unfrequently break&#xD;
forth amid regions the most placid.&#xD;
Well, if cross they must, there was no time to lose in mere&#xD;
hesitancy. Accordingly Fishall unshipped the rudder and&#xD;
rove a long oar through a strong becket in the stern sheets.&#xD;
This was done to give him a mastery over the direction of the&#xD;
boat. The thole pins were at the same time examined, and&#xD;
where necessary, new ones substituted. All being ready, four&#xD;
oars were thrown out, spreading their blades like a double&#xD;
row of fins to the fleet dolphin.&#xD;
The boat glided , wiftly on. Still the men plied their oars&#xD;
gingerly, husbanding their strength for the moment of need.&#xD;
Reaching the vergs of the- outermost bar, the men lay on&#xD;
their oars a few moments, awaiting a smooth time. To Marl,&#xD;
as the post of honor, had been assigned the aftermost oar.&#xD;
But Walter being deemed a useless appendage, where only&#xD;
sinew hands could be useful, lay coiled up under the bow, in&#xD;
a state of intense anxiety.&#xD;
"Give way now, boys," breathed Fishall, gripping and hug..&#xD;
ging with energy the steering oar, his eyes at the same time&#xD;
fixed with solicitous intent upon the spot of the most danger-&#xD;
ous wave. The men wielded with nervous vigor. The boat&#xD;
flew over the fevered waves as if a conscious being. Happily&#xD;
the bar remained comparatively smooth, and, as the trembling&#xD;

&#xD;
boat neared the innermost verge of the shoal, a load of anx-&#xD;
iety was removed from every breast. Each heart swelled&#xD;
with gratitude at so quiet and safe transit. But suddenly, as&#xD;
if touched with the wand-of magic, a mountain wave gathered&#xD;
just astern, and came down upon them roaring and bristling&#xD;
like a rabid animal. Walter's heart quivered in his throat.&#xD;
The rowers peaked their oars a cock-bill, and laid graspingly&#xD;
hold of the thwarts. Fishall's eyes rolled in frenzied trepida-&#xD;
tion. Bracing firmly his feet, and renewing his gripping em-&#xD;
brace with the steering oar, he awaited the result. It seemed&#xD;
that the fierce towering billow must submerge them beneath&#xD;
its emerald breast. Escape looked hopeless. But the fragile&#xD;
barque managed to mount the foamy crest, when, locked in&#xD;
firm embrace, the two sped on together, like delirious lovers.&#xD;
Indeed, the speed of the boat was so intense, as to thrill every&#xD;
nerve to the fingers' ends. As the waves caused by the velo-&#xD;
city of the boat were thrown up on either side, at the gun-&#xD;
wales, it created the sublime illusion of riding post haste to&#xD;
the very bottom of the deep. This intense emotion, was,&#xD;
however, but momentary ; for the wave disdaining the union,&#xD;
soon outstripped the boat, and before another sea could be&#xD;
formed, she was within the shoal and out of danger. All now&#xD;
took a long breath.&#xD;
The inner bar was yet to be crossed. This was less for-&#xD;
midable than the outer one, yet it looked sufficiently appalling.&#xD;
to keep alive the sentiment that had been awakened within&#xD;
them. They paused a moment to contemplate the peril of a&#xD;
second trial. At a favorable moment that they had been&#xD;
waiting for, Fishall again gave the word to pull away. In a&#xD;
moment, the boat was dancing among the trembling breakers.&#xD;
It proved rougher here than upon the outer bar, still they&#xD;
were about to achieve the feat nobly, when suddenly the boat&#xD;
struck her stem against the rib of an old hulk imbedded in&#xD;
&#xD;
the sand. The unexpected concussion sent an electric thrill&#xD;
through every bosom. They sprang up, and reversed their&#xD;
oars with a view to shove off, but a rolling wave coming up&#xD;
behind, struck the stern, capsized1 the boat, and- precipitated&#xD;
all hands overboard among the angry waves.&#xD;
Walter struck the water in a state of utter bewilderment&#xD;
a gleam of terror, a convulsive throe, a sinking down, down,&#xD;
the green waters receding from his filmy vision, like depart-&#xD;
ing phantoms, a distressed oppression like a hand of lead,&#xD;
pressing upon his vitals, a waning consciousness, and a vague&#xD;
feeling that all was over -these were, at least, the dim sensa-&#xD;
tions he could afterwards recall.&#xD;
Rising to the surface by mere reaction, and instinctively&#xD;
grasping by good fortune a drifting oar, he was enabled to&#xD;
keep from again sinking. The first object that struck his&#xD;
conscious gaze, was the blessed vision of old Marl, whose head&#xD;
was bobbing among the breakers, looking like Hope cast amid&#xD;
the whirlpools of life. The keen sighted sailor had already&#xD;
caught a glimpse of the boy, and was bearing down for him&#xD;
with all the energy of a generous purpose. With an arm&#xD;
nerved by the force of humanity, he placed the boy upon the&#xD;
boat, and then carelessly struck off himself for the shore.&#xD;
Having reached it, he found the rest of the crew happily es-&#xD;
caped from the treacherous element, into which they had been&#xD;
so summarily thrown, and giving heart-felt thanks in rough,&#xD;
but honest accents, for their hair-breadth deliverance.&#xD;
The wrecked boat having drifted into the surf, Walter,&#xD;
half lifeless with exhaustion, crawled up the beach, and joined&#xD;
the rest.&#xD;
By one of those felicitous threads in the web of chance, an-&#xD;
other boat's crew were upon the beach. They had come for&#xD;
a sojourn of a few days, for gunning, eeling, quahauging, and&#xD;
such like staple sports; and were, in consequence, well sup-&#xD;

A COLD BATH.&#xD;

TH1E FISHER BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
plied with comforts. On seeing the capsize, their manly sym-&#xD;
pathies could not but be aroused to the highest pitch, and they&#xD;
came bounding up in breathless haste, to proffer their fullest&#xD;
aid.&#xD;
Fortunately, one found upon his person a supplied tinder&#xD;
box, flint and steel. With these, a fire was struck up under&#xD;
a hillock, and kept glowingly alive by means of dried grass&#xD;
and drift wood strewed plentifully around.&#xD;
Another ran, and with alacrity of heart, brought them cold&#xD;
victuals.  Thus refreshed, and warmed by the crackling&#xD;
flames, they began to feel like new men. Walter especially&#xD;
experienced a sense of renovation, that seemed to him like a&#xD;
new birth. He would not have believed' himself susceptible&#xD;
of so delicious animation. It imparted the most exquisite&#xD;
elasticity to his feelings. ,Indeed, he would have been willing&#xD;
to pass through the same perils- again, if only to taste the&#xD;
sweet glow of gladdening comfort, that was suffusing his sys-&#xD;
tem.&#xD;
Flagging nature at length restored, the ill-starred fishermen&#xD;
began buckling up their spirits, in order to start anew for&#xD;
home. The other boat's crew freely tendered them such hos-&#xD;
pitality as they had to offer, -a night's lodging with them&#xD;
under their own boat that lay a little way off, turned over and&#xD;
banked up with sea-weed and sand,-not so dainty a sleep-&#xD;
ing apartment, they admitted, as might be found in the world,&#xD;
yet to the crystal conscience, and weary bodies, of rough, hon-&#xD;
est fishermen, as inviting of sleep, as the softest, silk-canopied&#xD;
couch, might be to the delicate attenuated limbs of the sur-&#xD;
feited wretch.     -&#xD;
But our home-bound fishermen were in no wise disposed to&#xD;
accept this frank hospitality. The little adventure of upset-&#xD;
ting was after all but a mere jostle in the road of their jour-&#xD;
ney. It seemed to have emboldened their natures, instead of&#xD;
&#xD;
making them more timorous. They were besides desirous of&#xD;
intercepting the Pink before she crossed the bay.&#xD;
So resolutely they mustered forward. But between the in-&#xD;
ception of a resolution, and the goal of achievement, there not&#xD;
unfrequently lies in the way many a knotty obstacle, over-&#xD;
looked in the hasty mental grasp of the route.&#xD;
In making ready to start, they found that in the upsetting&#xD;
of the boat, much of her equipment had been lost. They were,&#xD;
however, promptly relieved from this embarrassment by the&#xD;
untiring kindness of the other boat's crew. But amid the&#xD;
pale of the surrounding darkness, first to strike unerringly the&#xD;
mouth of tlie channel, then to keep the devious depth through&#xD;
the wide waters across the beach, nearly filled with sand-flats,&#xD;
and quagmires of decayed sea-weed, was such as to tax to the&#xD;
utmost their keenest sagacity.&#xD;
Necessity is the mother of invention. By towing along .the&#xD;
shore to the mouth of the passage, then cautiously setting the&#xD;
boat ahead with oars,-all the time groping their way like&#xD;
blind men in a strange garret, - they succeeded at length, to&#xD;
gain the entrance way to the channel.&#xD;
Then came a knot of troublesome vicissitudes, -such as&#xD;
grazing upon this shallow, floundering over that, sticking fast&#xD;
upon another, - then pushing the boat backward, side-wise,&#xD;
around, forward, -- bat all to little purpose.&#xD;
At length, a good deal puzzled,.they resolved upon a more&#xD;
summary and efficient procedure.&#xD;
Plunge, dropped overboard one man, sending up a shudder-&#xD;
ing wail at the effect of the cold bath upon his nerves, a wail&#xD;
that made the darkness more hideous. Plunge, followed an-&#xD;
other, giving in turn a plaintive squeal, at experiencing a sim-&#xD;
ilar sensation to that of his daring predecessor. Then plunge,&#xD;
plunge they dropped into the water, like leads over the side&#xD;
of a fishing-vessel. .&#xD;

UNPLEASANT PROSPECT.          107&#xD;
&#xD;
"Cold pig, this," muttered Marl, drawing in his breath, with&#xD;
a groan, as he crawled over the side of 'the boat, taking care&#xD;
to find a firm resting-place for one foot, before removing the&#xD;
other knee from the gunwale. I'd sooner be lashing on a jib-&#xD;
boom in the teeth of a screaming Nor-Easter, with the ther-&#xD;
mometer at zero, than trudging and shivering along in this&#xD;
"slough of despond."&#xD;
"Only a touch of the wet blanket," chattered Fishall. The&#xD;
rest were silent. They had no feeling just then for pleas-&#xD;
antry; and they thought, besides, their present predicament&#xD;
no joke.&#xD;
Meanwhile Walter, who, thanks to the generous care of old&#xD;
Marl, had lain under the bow snugly tucked up in an old pea-&#xD;
jacket, was aroused from his dozing, by the splashing of the&#xD;
crew along side. Though of a gentle spirit, he was not one to&#xD;
hesitate sharing the hardship of suffering companions. With&#xD;
a feeling of sympathetic gladness, he boldly jumped over into&#xD;
the water with the rest.&#xD;
The progress of the boat was now more sure, although not&#xD;
devoid of vicissitude. Using their feet for sounding lead, and&#xD;
their sinew arms for propellers, they floundered along through&#xD;
the obscure channel; now settling to the arm-pits in water,&#xD;
and again sinking to the knees in a quagmire of decayed sea-&#xD;
weed, until at length, they felt the joyous relief of deepening&#xD;
off into the clear waters .and firm shelving bottom of the&#xD;
bay.&#xD;
Their success was achieved by meeting with a brave judg-&#xD;
ment the inevitable obstacles of their path-way.  Their&#xD;
course was emblematic of a gallant spirit, bearing on steadily&#xD;
amid the muddy channels and devious currents of life.&#xD;
The other boat's crew that had stuck to them like fast&#xD;
friends in adversity, now modestly took their leave. This'&#xD;
was done in a simple and quiet way. Indeed, there seemed&#xD;
&#xD;
no desire for display on either side. The others acted as&#xD;
if conscious of having merely done their duty, without car-&#xD;
ing to thrust a sense of obligation upon their beneficiaries.&#xD;
These latter as content to preserve the memory of a rich&#xD;
favor, and let its spiritual fragrance ennoble their own life for&#xD;
good.&#xD;
Beautiful, indeed, is- the rainbow form of politeness, but&#xD;
sweeter by far is the endeared act of kindness, flowing from&#xD;
the unaffected pulsations of-a generous heart.&#xD;
Although they had threaded the tortuous entrance of the&#xD;
bay, yet all vexatious obstacles were not yet surmounted.&#xD;
The night seemed of an Egyptian darkness. No moon hung&#xD;
like a silvery lamp in the sky.  Not a star could peep&#xD;
through the black cloud enshrouding the heavens. The very&#xD;
spirit of darkness seemed brooding over the deep, settling&#xD;
gently upon the broad bosom of ocean, as with raven wings.&#xD;
Indeed, the imagination could be reminded of a night before&#xD;
creation.&#xD;
The wind began to freshen. Appearances boded a speedy&#xD;
onset of the threatening storm. That it might overtake them&#xD;
before achieving the passage, was but .a reasonable apprehen-&#xD;
sion. It should be borne in mind, that their clothing was sat-&#xD;
urated with salt water, their skin chafed to soreness, and them-&#xD;
selves drooping with fatigue and exhaustion.&#xD;
This appalling prospect, added to a shivering numbness&#xD;
from sudden inaction, that was fast creeping over them ; -&#xD;
along with a certain gloomy dejection, which a raw east wind&#xD;
is wont to work upon the nerves, were circumstances keenly&#xD;
disheartening. Moreover, there was no light nor compass- in&#xD;
the boat to steer by ; and, although Fancy conjured up no&#xD;
rocks under the lee, to inspire terror, yet to see the boat foun-&#xD;
der by shipping an unlucky sea, to get swamped in crossing&#xD;
the bar, or to strike the main-land wide of the mark, and foun-&#xD;

FALLING IN WITH THE PINK. ~      109&#xD;
&#xD;
der in the surf, were circumstances not particularly soothing&#xD;
to the mind, already dejected by exposure.&#xD;
But men well inured in the warfare of life, are wont to be&#xD;
not easily discouraged. Their every day grapplings with&#xD;
sturdy nature, leave a fortitude and trepidation of character,&#xD;
that blinks not at difficulties. Such spirits anticipate in ad-&#xD;
vance, the giant Danger, and coolly prepare for the onset.&#xD;
They are thus not easily overcome by his wily surprises.&#xD;
Their genius rises with the wave of emergency, instead of be-&#xD;
ing overcome by it.&#xD;
Moreover, in the intense excitement that accompanies situ-&#xD;
ations of great peril, the soul happily falls unconsciously into&#xD;
an illusion. It is for the moment blind to the impending dan-&#xD;
ger. And it is only when the trial has been passed, and is&#xD;
reviewed by the calm eye of retrospect, that the danger of the&#xD;
scene rises before the mind in its due proportion.&#xD;
But striking random bearings of Monomoy and Chatham&#xD;
lights, which were sharply glimmering through the murky air,,&#xD;
and shaping their course by judgment, that magnet of the&#xD;
soul, to which experience in life imparts greater trueness of&#xD;
touch, they awaited -results, as men who had done what might&#xD;
be in the path of duty.&#xD;
The threatening breeze did not, however, as it was 'feared,&#xD;
swell into a furious gale. It rather subsided to a hectic&#xD;
breath, which came creeping over the waters, like the feeble&#xD;
respiration of a consumptive man.&#xD;
The boat under a single sail could only grope her way lan-&#xD;
guidly. The weary hours lingered behind with sullen gloom.&#xD;
Talk, that swift winged messenger of Time, halted.&#xD;
At length it was felt, they must be nearly over the bay,&#xD;
In truth, their strained vision drew forth from the shadowy&#xD;
realms of darkness, the dim outline ,f land. The sudden and&#xD;
marvellous effect the sight had upon the crew, filled Walter&#xD;
&#xD;
with uncontrollable curiosity. Indeed, the very word "land,"&#xD;
seemed a fairy wand, whose magic touch dissolved the fetters&#xD;
of the soul, restoring it to the joy of freedom.&#xD;
As the older fishermen, each garrulous as half tipsy&#xD;
black-birds, were in a glee of excitement, guessing out&#xD;
the precise whereabouts of'the boat, Walter still remained&#xD;
snugly rolled up under the bow, yet hardly willing to leave&#xD;
his warm, cosy retreat. As his eyes wandered thoughtfully&#xD;
amid the blank  darkness, suddenly they chanced to fall&#xD;
upon something, that sent a startling thrill through his whole&#xD;
frame.&#xD;
It was .a crescent of white foam just on the weather&#xD;
bow. He was at first struck with the belief of its being a&#xD;
breaker, a phenomenon to which he had become painfully&#xD;
sensitive. Bounding from  his covert, he gave the alarm&#xD;
with a shriek that shot like an arrow through every breast.&#xD;
All eyes darted instantaneously toward the spot indicated&#xD;
by the boy, and remained transfixed there in a wild, con-&#xD;
vulsive stare. But this sight proved but the prelude to a&#xD;
more gigantic apparition, for while standing petrified in&#xD;
unazement, there slowly emerged from  the folds of the&#xD;
darkness, like a resurrection, a grizzly bulk, surmounted by&#xD;
an irregularly'shaped phantom, which to their excited imagi-&#xD;
nation, seemed the evil genius of night flapping his broad&#xD;
wings to destroy.&#xD;
The crew catching the sight, sent up in turn, a sinmultane-&#xD;
ous shout, so piercing as to make the darkness quake. It&#xD;
rolled back to the mysterious object like a deep anthem. The&#xD;
huge spectre at once slowly changed its direction, and was&#xD;
moving past them, when "halloa," shouted Fishall, -"the&#xD;
Pink, by jingo; lucky dogs, ain't we ; after all, a miss is as&#xD;
good as a mile. Halloa, there," lie repeated, "send us a rope,&#xD;
-a rope, I say."&#xD;

<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC8107-00000057"/>&#xD;
THE FISHER BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
GOING ON SHORE.&#xD;
&#xD;
The familiar voice of Fishall was instantly seized by&#xD;
the quick ear of the skipper. A   rope was sent with a&#xD;
gladdening impetus, and, in a twinkling, the boat's crew had&#xD;
scrambled over the side of the vessel, and were on board.&#xD;
Mutual congratulations were exchanged ; then followed the&#xD;
breathless narrations of their hair-breadth escapes and other&#xD;
vicissitudes.&#xD;
As for Walter, he felt an ecstasy of gratitude to be again&#xD;
on board of the Pink. He would not have believed the ves-&#xD;
sel so endeared to him. She seemed the warm genial hearth-&#xD;
stone of home after absence ; and when he recalled the- peril-&#xD;
lous scenes through which he had passed, he paced the deck&#xD;
in transport.&#xD;
The skipper having a compass to steer by, might well pre-&#xD;
sume on greater accuracy of reckoning than Fishall. Accord-&#xD;
ingly, the identity of the boat was merged into that of the&#xD;
larger craft.&#xD;
The presumption soon broke forth into reality ; for their&#xD;
exploring eyes now caught sight of a flickering light just&#xD;
ahead. It turned out to be on board of another fishing, craft&#xD;
which was just rounding to for anchor, in the time honored&#xD;
anchorage, called the Deep Hole.&#xD;
Guided by it, they felt their way along to a snug berth at&#xD;
anchor near the shore.&#xD;
" Shall we heave out the boat, or- go ashore in the&#xD;
prize-boat alongside," demanded Fishall of the skipper.&#xD;
The latter was too far in another part of the vessel to&#xD;
hear.&#xD;
"hGo ashore now, whew," interrupted Marl. "You're in a&#xD;
mighty hurry to see Mamma and Bess. Why, at this time&#xD;
of night, you'd be prowling over the old fields, awaking up&#xD;
all the roosters and barking dogs, far and near. Whereas, a&#xD;
couple of hours'd give you daylight to make your welcome&#xD;
&#xD;
bow in. What chowder-heads these women folks make of&#xD;
you."&#xD;
This bit of raillery from  the Salt, fell like* a snow-flake&#xD;
upon the bosom of the thirsty ocean. It did not elicit even a&#xD;
note of reply. Each seemed too intently absorbed for that, in&#xD;
the fulfilment of what was nearest his heart,--namely, get-&#xD;
ting home.&#xD;
It may be safely asserted that the heart beats as warm-&#xD;
ly, under a fisherman's jacket, as beneath the 'richest fus-&#xD;
tian.&#xD;
Indeed, a simple life, while it keeps pure the native emo-&#xD;
tions, greatly increases their force, by bearing them onward in&#xD;
a few well defined channels.&#xD;
Ere long, they pushed blithely off, from the vessel toward&#xD;
the shore. The boat now   cleft the water more fleetly,&#xD;
than when taking them   on board for the voyage. And&#xD;
altogether natural was this, for a different motive lay at&#xD;
the spring of their movement.&#xD;
Now the boat touches the shore; they jump to land with&#xD;
b  ow  e  ot oucestheshre;thy jump t  adwith&#xD;
bounding feet. She is drawn up with a will, her kee&#xD;
barely touching the sand; and turned over with a whirl that&#xD;
would have graced a circus-rider.&#xD;
But for Marl's unbending habit of care, the oars even&#xD;
would hardly have got snugly put away.&#xD;
On they trudged with quickened step, the eye of Fancy&#xD;
fixed upon the dear hearth-stone rising before them in the&#xD;
sweet mirage of anticipation.&#xD;
As for Walter, he felt like a new being, so marvellous had&#xD;
been the transformation in his entire consciousness. The&#xD;
chill air of ocean, softened to an aromatic gale, sighed mellif&#xD;
luous through the murmuring pine-tops, and its mild touch&#xD;
seemed like the soft gentle hand of woman.&#xD;
It soothed the excitement of his feelings, and awakened&#xD;

&#xD;
emotions of joy-and love, that ran through his frame in hal-&#xD;
cyon currents.&#xD;
At length, The dear, venerable mansion stood out before&#xD;
them, dimly in the mellow gray of night. Here the crew&#xD;
separated from Walter, each for his own home, - ever the&#xD;
sweetest spot of earth,'but to the fisherman, the one single&#xD;
magnet of his affections. If, for the lowly, there be fewer&#xD;
objects to claim the homage of the heart, toward these the&#xD;
fires. of love burn with a clearer, ruddier glow.&#xD;
Walter stood a moment before the scene, distracted by the&#xD;
novelty of his emotions. Familiar, yet how strange every-&#xD;
thing struck his sense. It was the same beloved homestead&#xD;
of his youth. Yet to his mental vision how different from the&#xD;
one parted with but a little while before. In truth, a deep&#xD;
and intense experience had given a new lens to the eye of his&#xD;
soul. Besides, that longing for home, which during his ab-&#xD;
sence, had given polarity to his every thought, was now&#xD;
strange enough to himself; felt no more. It was followed&#xD;
even by a sensible indifference toward the desired object,&#xD;
along with an odd perception of mind, not unlike that which&#xD;
comes from suddenly being rid of a long worn habit.&#xD;
Strange anomaly of the soul, that seems even for the mo-&#xD;
ment to lose the sense of enjoyment, when just on the boun-&#xD;
dary of possession. , Is it that the swell of emotion forces the&#xD;
feelings to dead inanity, or that the wave of desire recedes&#xD;
to leave a cleaner breach for the mighty swell of the coming&#xD;
billow?&#xD;
But he reaches the quaint portico, and lays his hand upog&#xD;
the massive brass handle of the door. This he had scarcely&#xD;
rattled a second time, before the responsive portal cautiously&#xD;
opened. Behold the transcendent form of his mother ! Ec-&#xD;
static moment !  The bounding gushes of sympathy over-&#xD;
leaped the flood-gates of his soul.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Walter," "Mother," were all that utterance could vent;&#xD;
and they were instantly locked in each other's arms.&#xD;
What more graceful, more noble,'than filial affection!&#xD;
What deeper, purer, more angelic, than a mother's love !&#xD;

CHAPTER       VIII.&#xD;
" Maternal love ! thou word that seems all bliss,&#xD;
Gives and receives all bliss;- fullest when most&#xD;
Thou givest! spring-head of all felicity,&#xD;
Deepest when most is drawn ! emblem of God !&#xD;
Overflowing most when greatest numbers drink."&#xD;
POLLOCK.&#xD;
WHEN, Walter awoke, the morning sun was streaming in&#xD;
brightly through the eastern windows of his narrow bed-room.&#xD;
The threatening storm had not vented its spite. Indeed, the&#xD;
puny demonstration proved to be only a little foible of Na-&#xD;
ture ; for as if suddenly repenting itself, the vacillating wind&#xD;
hitched back to the south-west, the black clouds hurried away,&#xD;
and the sky put on again its wonted-smile of serenity.&#xD;
His first impression on opening the eyes, was of 'being still&#xD;
on board of the Pink, tossing upon the restless sea. But the&#xD;
comfortable neatness of his room, the golden sunshine flooding&#xD;
it, the soft tread of his mother, preparing the breakfast, and&#xD;
the genial crackling of the flames in the adjoining apartment,&#xD;
dissipated the illusion, and created sensations so delicious;&#xD;
that in a feeling of dreamy repose, he turned languidly upon&#xD;
his pillow for the luxury of a second nap.&#xD;
"Ah, my son," sighed Mrs. Carl, as the boy finished relat-&#xD;
ing the more startling incidents of the trip, "I hope the dan-&#xD;
gers and hardships you have passed through, will strike you&#xD;
with a dread of-the sea; and that I shall be spared the an-&#xD;
guish of another parting."&#xD;
The boy made no reply. He had not the courage to de-&#xD;
(114)&#xD;
&#xD;
stroy the illusive hope of his mother. Yet little did she im-&#xD;
agine the mysterious workings within the breast of her son.&#xD;
The grim trials of his voyage instead of weaning him from&#xD;
the sea, had aroused the latent energies of his nature, and im-&#xD;
parted a heroic complexion to his feelings; and, as the neigh-&#xD;
bors crowded around him with an air of intense sympathetic&#xD;
curiosity, to listen to his witching narratives, he was conscious&#xD;
of a glow of animation, that cast into oblivion the sufferings&#xD;
he had experienced, and made him more resolute than ever,&#xD;
for a "life upon the ocean-wave."&#xD;
The sun was blazing high over the pine-tops, before the&#xD;
skipper made his appearance. As an act of courtesy to Mrs.&#xD;
Carl, he had called on his way to the shore, for Walter to jotn&#xD;
them in boarding the Pink. The severe brushing the little&#xD;
craft had encountered, rendered certain repairs indispensable,&#xD;
before it were safe to venture again upon the treacherous ele-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
This would bring a delay. Mrs. Carl seized the propitious&#xD;
circumstance to secure the interval for her son to remain with&#xD;
her at home. To this end, she wrestled so earnestly, and with&#xD;
such a tone of success, that the skipper yielded, though in so&#xD;
doing, lie subjected himself to the fault-finding of the crew.&#xD;
The boy was now free for a holiday stroll among scenes&#xD;
and acquaintances of his home. He could iot but enjoy the&#xD;
furlough prodigiously. So long had he been tied up to the&#xD;
narrow tossings of a sea-life, that he now felt his expansive&#xD;
freedom, as does the wing of an uncaged bird. The wood-&#xD;
land air mellowed upon his sense, in soft contrast from the&#xD;
raw breeze of the sea. The picturesque surroundings of the&#xD;
Mansion, had become dwarfed a little, it is true, in com-&#xD;
parison with the illimitable ken of old Ocean, but they fell&#xD;
upon the soul with a charm as sweet as the fragrant violet -of&#xD;
his native grove.&#xD;

116              THE FISHER BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
He was conscious moreover of a larger power of life. The&#xD;
germinating seeds of his faculties, quickened by intense expe-&#xD;
rience, had burst through the clay of his being, and were snif-&#xD;
fing the radiance of heaven. Nature wore a brighter, a more&#xD;
animating hue. A freshness of spirit gladdened his breast,,&#xD;
and gave suppleness to his limbs. Life had for him a new&#xD;
charm.&#xD;
The neighbors greeted him, too, in a style very different&#xD;
from their wont. He was no longer to them the insignificant,&#xD;
though amiable youth of past days. He had received a touch,&#xD;
as they termed it, of real life ; and this bound him in a chord&#xD;
of sympathy with themselves. More even than this. He had&#xD;
gote through passages of peril, that had not happened even in&#xD;
their own varied experience, -sublime scenes known to them&#xD;
only through the-eye of fancy. This embalmed him in their&#xD;
eyes with the heroic; and the tone and gesture - the elo-&#xD;
quence of the illiterate-with which they addressed him,&#xD;
aroused to the verge of enthusiasm, the self-gratulation al-&#xD;
ready throbbing his breast.&#xD;
Then he had risen in social consequence marvellously&#xD;
among his youthful companions. He had been lifted to an&#xD;
undisputed elevation. He could now look down upon them&#xD;
from a position positively earned. This unfolded superiority&#xD;
might be likeied to a beautiful flower that bursts into bloom&#xD;
in a single night, eclipsing surrounding shrubs.&#xD;
Then what charm had gained the society of his female ac-&#xD;
quaintances ! As he circulated among them, their gentle&#xD;
forms seemed to have caught new grace, their vivacious souls&#xD;
brighter sparks of ethereal fire. This was, however, but an&#xD;
illusion, - doubtless, one of those complacent arts of nature,,&#xD;
to beguile to a happier state of mind, -but still a deception.&#xD;
It was but an image, mirrored from the golden rays of the&#xD;
boy's own imagination.&#xD;
&#xD;
Still, their manner was obviously changed. There was a&#xD;
certain maidenly coyness which he had never before observed.&#xD;
This struck him oddly, while it but heightened the charm of&#xD;
his agreeable emotions. These blushing beauties fell upon&#xD;
his artless nature, like the magic brush, that touches with&#xD;
lively hues the beaming picture.&#xD;
To a cursory observer, such tender graces might have been&#xD;
construed into that mysterious sympathy of the human heart,&#xD;
that will blush at its purest feelings, and elude the object it&#xD;
most tenderly desires.&#xD;
But such was not the case. Their sweet deference did not&#xD;
spring from any seductive sentiment the boy was uncon-&#xD;
sciously weaving around them. It issued from a nobler&#xD;
source. It was that beautiful homage, the heart of woman in-&#xD;
stinctively yields to the heroic in man, that Desdemona inspi-&#xD;
ration that is thralled by noble daring, and manly energy.&#xD;
For we find that the zenith beauty of woman, is perceived&#xD;
only in contrast with her co-equal, man, as the grandeur of&#xD;
man is heightened when beaming in the azure heaven of&#xD;
woman. Thus the more pure, delicate, and gentle her nature,&#xD;
the more earnestly she seeks a manly trunk around which to&#xD;
wind her gentle tendrils. That is, as the shores of their unit-&#xD;
ing natures widen, do the waters of~ their common soul-lake&#xD;
deepen. Let us then spurn the sentiment that would render&#xD;
woman, manish, and man womanish - would bridge the circle&#xD;
of whose circumference they make counterpart segments,-&#xD;
would merge into an impotent unit, what nature designed as a&#xD;
blessed duality. The towering mountain peak catches a rare&#xD;
significance of grandeur, when mirrored upon the bosom of&#xD;
the placid lake below.&#xD;
But this joyous state of mind did not continue long un-&#xD;
clouded. The golden stream of his feelings flowed not with-&#xD;
out alloy. - Ere long other thoughts, a little dispiriting began&#xD;

SELF-ESTEEM.               119&#xD;
&#xD;
118              THE FISHER BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
entwining amid the wreath of his sensations. We will see&#xD;
how this was.&#xD;
Two or three families in the settlement had gradually&#xD;
risen to comparative wealth, by shop-trading. The posses-&#xD;
sion of substance, and their natural connection with the city,&#xD;
had inflated them with a species of vanity which took to itself&#xD;
airs of social superiority. The heads of a few other families.&#xD;
having ventured into the merchant service, had in due time&#xD;
meritoriously climbed to successful commandership. Their&#xD;
taste liberalized by voyaging abroad, very naturally showed&#xD;
itself in the erection and adornment of more pretentious&#xD;
homes.&#xD;
Worldly prosperity is apt to beguile the heart of its devotee&#xD;
into a feeling of superiority. It tends moreover to dazzle the&#xD;
eyes of the less fortunate into a feeling of envious admiration.&#xD;
And when wealth gained in a given pursuit seems to invest&#xD;
the possessor with superior address and intelligence, it never'&#xD;
fails to turn the heads of the plodding poor, and make them&#xD;
restive under their own peculiar burden, in the dusty road of&#xD;
life.&#xD;
Now, these two classes-namely, the traders and the ship-&#xD;
captains, acquired an influence of opinion, and set an example&#xD;
of style, that quite upset the simple and homely notions pre-&#xD;
valent in the neighborhood. The result was to bring fishing&#xD;
into disrepute; and the calling had already begun to be&#xD;
looked upon as low and menial. Thus a branch of homely&#xD;
industry, which had been followed from time immemorial,&#xD;
bringing health, comfort, and contentment to most, and- com-&#xD;
petence to not a few, became to be discarded. The quiet sat-&#xD;
isfaction of the past had departed, and a new era was follow-&#xD;
ing upon its heels.&#xD;
It may be here observed, that although Walter enjoyed a&#xD;
most enviable popularity, yet he was thought to be tinctured&#xD;
&#xD;
with one blemish. This was what was considered an unwar-&#xD;
rantable pride. , He had ever been looked upon as a proud&#xD;
mortal, which was the more noticeable, as the circumstances&#xD;
of his life did not seem to justify on his part any such feel-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
Claiming for our hero no immunity from the weakness&#xD;
common to humanity, we must admit of there being something&#xD;
in his composition to warrant the notion very generally enter-&#xD;
tained of his possessing an inordinate self-esteem. Having&#xD;
admitted this much, we must in fairness say further, that this&#xD;
defect, if such it could be called, did not spring so much from&#xD;
an egotistical nature, as from a combination of circumstances,&#xD;
beyond human control. But the eye of the public which is&#xD;
-very keen sighted to note the failings of its members, is not&#xD;
always so sharp to trace the cause of any Peculiarity. The&#xD;
spots upon the sun are observed with little trouble, but the&#xD;
reason for this phenomenon, has baffled the most astute phi-&#xD;
losophers.&#xD;
If the eccentricities of character could be looked at fully by&#xD;
the searching eye of truth, many an ungainly trait would be&#xD;
found to be simply superior worth forced from the channels&#xD;
of conventionalism. And if mankind were made to feel the&#xD;
touch of an Ithuriel's Spear, many a fair-seeming, smoth-&#xD;
tongued being, would spring up a hideous monster.&#xD;
As for Walter, what was dwelt upon as an overweening&#xD;
pride, if not proof of excellence, was at least the result of cir-&#xD;
cumstances which he might not control.&#xD;
True, the boy was surrounded by penury. Discourage-&#xD;
ment like a dark cloud hung over his pathway. Still but a&#xD;
youth, he had as yet achieved nothing to swell him with lofty&#xD;
self-esteem. Yet a manly spirit pervaded his being; noble&#xD;
aspirations crowded his breast. Then there was the inspira-&#xD;
tion of blood. He was~related both on his maternal and pa-&#xD;
&#xD;
*&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC8107-00000062"/>&#xD;
2w,0&#xD;
120&#xD;
&#xD;
ternal side to the most pretentious families of the settlement.&#xD;
Indeed, the best of the Puritan blood flowed in his veins; and&#xD;
he could trace his descent direct to the May Flower, that an-&#xD;
chored in Cape Cod Harbor. Whatever may be said to the&#xD;
contrary, there is something in the pride of ancestry, that ap-&#xD;
peals to the noblest instinct of our nature.&#xD;
Besides, his mother, by an overweening care, might have&#xD;
formed within him the gales of self-love. At least, filial grat-&#xD;
itude inspired him to achieve something worthy of her ambi-&#xD;
tion, and deep toned affection. Then his anomalous situation&#xD;
related to the best families, yet not feeling free to associate&#xD;
with them on terms of equal footing, made him peculiarly&#xD;
sensitive to earn for himself a commanding position.&#xD;
However humble his condition, he yet felt burning within&#xD;
an earnest of victory in the battle of life. Visions of a lofty&#xD;
career were wont to flit before his mental eye. Fires burned&#xD;
in the depth of his soul, that lit up his imagination to a splen-&#xD;
dor, that threw the actuality of his humble lot into insignifi-&#xD;
cance. le would remain hours in day-dreamings, in which&#xD;
he was translated to other worlds, amid=scenes more congenial&#xD;
to his panting spirit. These fairy regions were peopled with&#xD;
a race of a nature more consonant with his own unearthly&#xD;
spirit,-with a race actuated by motives that satisfied more&#xD;
fully the integrity of his crystal being. It was in one of these&#xD;
golden reveries, that we first saw him standing upon the turfy&#xD;
bridge, not far from the Old Mansion.&#xD;
Walter did not mingle so freely as was natural with his&#xD;
youthful companions. He appeared coy of their most animat-&#xD;
ing sports. A pensive reserve showed itself at all times in&#xD;
his manner. This was mistaken for a native haughtiness of&#xD;
feeling. But its roots sprang deeper. He could not endure&#xD;
the thoughtless obscenity that would occasionally break out&#xD;
among his playmates, like the suddengniring up of a crystal&#xD;
&#xD;
WOUNDED PRIDE.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
stream. It shocked his fine sensibilities, and turned the most&#xD;
joyous sport into loathing. The seeming hard lot of his birth&#xD;
hung constantly around lim, like a cloud against a morning's&#xD;
horizon. It checked the current of youthful gleesomeness,&#xD;
and imprinted even a sedate hue to his youthful expression.&#xD;
And then there was the abstraction continually of the glorious&#xD;
visions of a golden future, ever rising before him to divert his&#xD;
mind from the r)lesent.&#xD;
Thus what was looked upon as peculiar in the boy, was but&#xD;
a tender, yet deep, spiritual energy, that while struggling&#xD;
amid the tangled path of his lot, was opening a vista into the&#xD;
realms of the future.&#xD;
What finer than youthful genius lit up by hues of heaven,&#xD;
casting its brightness without, to illumine its ascent up the&#xD;
lofty mount of Fame&#xD;
As we have before observed, amid the joyous greetings of&#xD;
his arrival home, twinges of mortification would now and then&#xD;
arise. In truth, his feelings had become somewhat tumultu-&#xD;
ous, now that the first wave of welcome had subsided. New&#xD;
flushed hope, that had given wings to his spirit for a fresh-&#xD;
ened life, could not prevent the sinking of his feelings to a'&#xD;
state of bitter dejection.&#xD;
This abasement arose from contemplating how utterly he&#xD;
had compromised his future, by entering upon the despised&#xD;
pursuit of fishing. The pulse of his being had beaten toward&#xD;
a higher life, not only to satisfy an inward craving for eleva-&#xD;
tion, but to wrest from his pathway the shadowing hand of&#xD;
penury,.and to rise in the future to a social preeminence.&#xD;
But by yielding to the tender solicitude of his mother, he had&#xD;
sunk even deeper into the miry waters of an humble lot.&#xD;
This thought grew painful to him, especially so, as he re-&#xD;
flected how it must widen the social gulf between himself and&#xD;
certain distant relations, whose, equality he desired to con-&#xD;

&#xD;
mand. The young females belonging to these, had shown&#xD;
toward him, as he fancied, a chilling reserve; and this, as he&#xD;
further thought, because of the disparity in their social posi-&#xD;
tion. In this the boy deceived himself. He -looked at the&#xD;
subject through his perverted feelings. It was his own little&#xD;
world, and not the fixed sun that moved. Cooped up in a&#xD;
circle of narrow sympathies, they would gladly have wel-&#xD;
comed him to friendly intercourse; even more, he might have&#xD;
won their intimate friendship; for nothing is. more disinter-&#xD;
ested than a young girl's partialities. But he did not see it&#xD;
so. He continued nursing his wounded pride, cherishing the&#xD;
purpose of one day wringing from them a brilliant admira-&#xD;
tion. How often the susceptible soul preys upon the griefs&#xD;
of its own creation !&#xD;
Before setting out from his youth-harbor, that is, fixing&#xD;
upon a calling, his career could not be divined. His future&#xD;
was hid by an impenetrable veil. He could retreat from the&#xD;
humility of his condition, behind the possibility of a future&#xD;
elevation. This buoyant anticipation sustained him. It ena-&#xD;
bled him to smother many a fancied slight under the lurking&#xD;
resolution of springing some day to a glory that should dazzle&#xD;
with its brightness-&#xD;
But now he had set sails to his barque, had hoisted the col-&#xD;
ors of his calling. The voyage of his career lay disclosed to&#xD;
view, and oh how it falsified his taste and aspirations ! and&#xD;
what a wide remove he had taken from the social point&#xD;
whence he started. This it was that brought to his mind a&#xD;
depth of abasement so profound, as to roll up a wave of de-&#xD;
jection, darkening the whole vista of his life. But the gloom-&#xD;
iest hours have an end; "and if not blessings in disguise, like&#xD;
rainy days, they at least gladden the coming sunshine to our&#xD;
sense.&#xD;
At least, thus was it with Walter. This phantom of per-&#xD;
&#xD;
vested sentiment gradually rolled off from his ridden spirit.&#xD;
Through the darkness that had shut down upon his horizon,&#xD;
there twinkled the beckoning star of Hope. Although com-&#xD;
promised to a calling held in low repute, by those whose opin-&#xD;
ions he most prized, there was yet left him this alternative:&#xD;
Ie might not wait for it inextricably to weave his fate, -&#xD;
to shackle the doom of his destiny. He need only make it&#xD;
the first round in the ladder of his climbing ascent. He&#xD;
could shake off whatever dust odium might attach, like the&#xD;
Apostles of old. .He would only remain till his fledged wings&#xD;
could take him to loftier flights. This thought breaking in&#xD;
upon his troubled spirit, like darting sunbeams through rented&#xD;
clouds, imparted a joyous spring to his ambition.&#xD;
It cleared up his dark vision, rolling back the clouds of de-&#xD;
spondency. Schemes congenial to his taste seized his imagi-&#xD;
nation, and buoyed him upon the pinions of Hope. As his&#xD;
mind become occupied with its communings, and stretched&#xD;
beyond the strata of earth, into the realms of Fancy, lie was&#xD;
more reconciled to his present situation. This moving in a&#xD;
round of drudgery, with the mind in a spiritual sphere of ex-&#xD;
istence, is the life balm  of those whose souls are leaping to&#xD;
some loftier romnd of existence. True, the restiveness of&#xD;
spirit it begets, brings little incense to the shrine of Mammon,&#xD;
but it places a rainbow in the sky of life, that steadies the eye&#xD;
of Faith. The boy was thus distracted by a flow of novel&#xD;
feelings. Day, upon brilliant wings, had flown swiftly athwart&#xD;
the arch, and was now nestling in dreamy repose in the crim-&#xD;
son west.&#xD;
In obedience to a sentiment of filial homage, Walter now&#xD;
set out for his grandfather's. He felt that another welcome&#xD;
was there in store for him. His feelings were buoyant at the&#xD;
consciousness of having risen in- manly consequence, since&#xD;
parting with this venerable parent of his mother; - and he&#xD;

124             THE FISHER BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
could not but set out with elastic step, at the thought of re-&#xD;
ceiving the benediction of one whose nature was in earnest&#xD;
sympathy with every form of honest struggling in~ life. Ac-&#xD;
cordingly, he sauntered thitherward, yielding to the gentle&#xD;
play of his.emotions.&#xD;
The shades of night were fast gathering round, dimming off&#xD;
objects to sombre outline. He had but just crossed the tire-&#xD;
less brook, which was sending up its sweet plaints to the list-&#xD;
ful ear of eve, when he was startled by the appearance of a&#xD;
person on the left of the pathway near him. It was plainly a&#xD;
female, and his impression was of its being some woman, very&#xD;
naturally on her way homeward from an afternoon's visit.&#xD;
Hence, for the moment, he dismissed the figure from his mind;&#xD;
but perceiving afterward, that it continued to keep the same&#xD;
relative position and ~ distance from him, his curiosity was&#xD;
awakened, and he pressed on with a view to overtake it. , But&#xD;
his quickened speed did not bring the expected approach.&#xD;
This struck him strangely, and he redoubled his pace, but not&#xD;
a whit did he seem to gain upon the moving apparition. In-&#xD;
deed, it was very like chasing one's own shadow. Provoked&#xD;
as well as excited, at being so completely foiled, he let out his&#xD;
gait to increased strides. But it was all of no avail, the de-&#xD;
fiant elf still, maintained its vantage ground.&#xD;
Walter was, by nature, sensitively timid, but the first par-&#xD;
oxysm of trepidation over, he was wont to wax bold, and&#xD;
gather a strength of resolution, that nothing could daunt.&#xD;
Determining to solve -the mystery before him, he bounded&#xD;
forward, and ran with such speed, that the fence by his side&#xD;
spun backward like objects darting past a moving railroad car.&#xD;
But this was as futile as his previous efforts. There was still&#xD;
the unresolved wonder, fixed as if held in the wiles of Fate.&#xD;
Only now he thought he perceived a fine oscillation of move-&#xD;
ment, and a gliding forward, as if drawn by a magic wire.&#xD;
&#xD;
Roused .now to fullest excitement, his frenzied enthusiasm&#xD;
lent wings to his speed, and he flew as it were over the&#xD;
ground. Reaching the skirts of the road, the evasive myth&#xD;
disappeared entirely. This, however,. but gave fresh impulse&#xD;
to his.movement, and a few quickened bounds brought him&#xD;
over the mill-dam, past the Washer Tree, up the steep winding&#xD;
Hill, until he arrived panting before the door of his grand-&#xD;
father. His speed was none the less accelerated, because of&#xD;
the momentary apprehension, that behind every passing&#xD;
shrub, the vanished unknown might dart forth, and clutch him&#xD;
to a fearful embrace. At the door he paused a few moments&#xD;
to take breath, and we will devote the interval in attempting&#xD;
a sketch.&#xD;
Walter's grandfather was a man of few words, -a man of&#xD;
action, rather than expression. His firm set character had&#xD;
been moulded in the hardy school of experience, instead of&#xD;
fashioned by the amenities of conventional society. His influ-&#xD;
ence was felt rather in the deep energy of his life, than seen in&#xD;
the specious glitter of verbiage. He belonged to a class who&#xD;
move in obedience to an irrepressible inward spring, to which&#xD;
external pressure but adds vital force, rather than to those&#xD;
that are fanned along by the friendly gales of fortune.&#xD;
Beginning his career as ship-builder, he had hewn out his&#xD;
rough way with a resolute arm, and thoroughly set the&#xD;
gnarled timbers of his fortune. By dint of sagacity united to&#xD;
an untiring energy, he rose to be considered one of the most&#xD;
consequential men of the town, although a singular straight-&#xD;
forwardness of disposition, bordering upon obstinacy, had&#xD;
made him no favorite with the public. Throughout his toil-&#xD;
some ascent, he moiled his way quite alone ; for this aloof&#xD;
standing world, very wisely extends the hand of aid only&#xD;
when the favor is not needed. As there were none upon&#xD;
which he could lean for prop, except such as were lured to&#xD;

&#xD;
him by the sordid spell of gain, he might well be said to have&#xD;
been the architect of his fortune. This absolute dependence&#xD;
upon his own resources, joined to one of those sterling natures&#xD;
to which action engenders enthusiasm and success emboldens&#xD;
the faculties, could not but impart to him immense energy&#xD;
and self-reliance. But fortuitous circumstances contributed&#xD;
to solidify hugely these corner traits of character.&#xD;
Of four brothers, he was the only one of the family group&#xD;
that had thrived. The others withered and dwarfed, held but&#xD;
a precarious existence, and that only under the fostering&#xD;
shade of his own vigorous branches. They might be seen&#xD;
shivering in the air of want, with eyes forever upturned for&#xD;
aid. His wife was a woman of soft nature, but of lively sym-&#xD;
pathies, and of a disposition intensely humane and benevo-&#xD;
lent. In consequence, the current of her life flowed all natu-&#xD;
rally toward the relief of misery, and she was ever seeking&#xD;
occasions for open-handed bounty. To prevent the wasting&#xD;
of his fortune, there was imposed upon Mr. Walfinch, the&#xD;
hard necessity of checking within limits the stream  of the&#xD;
good woman's benevolence. This gave him the appearance&#xD;
of penuriousness, a trait which at the bottom he did not pos-&#xD;
sess.&#xD;
His four children came upon the horizon of life with rosy&#xD;
prospects, but by an inscrutable fate, their bright future soon&#xD;
blighted, they were sooner or later forced back upon their&#xD;
father in hopeless dependence.&#xD;
The bridal joy of the eldest daughter ere long after mar-&#xD;
riage, was turned into mourning; and the widowed mother&#xD;
was forced to come with her two children, to claim the sup- *&#xD;
port of her father. She espoused a second time, but died in&#xD;
the meridian of life, under peculiar circumstances of painful&#xD;
sorrow. As for his other daughter, the mother of Walter, the&#xD;
tenderly beloved of his scion group, cruel Fate had caused&#xD;
&#xD;
her, too, to disappoint his ardent dream of Hope. -As if For-&#xD;
tune were contesting with him the battle of Life, face to face,&#xD;
every enterprise confided to others, had fallen back upon him&#xD;
a failure, whereas the undertakings of which he had retained&#xD;
the sole management, were always crowned with striking&#xD;
success.&#xD;
Thus isolated from dependent aid, he might be likened to a&#xD;
man breasting the swelling current with unassisted arm. His&#xD;
children thrown back upon him for support, at that advanced&#xD;
period of life, when man having sown with faithful energy,&#xD;
looks for filial aid apd sympathy, had the effect to knit every&#xD;
joint and fibre of his being. Chagrin falling upon an ardent&#xD;
nature, had acerbated his temper, melancholy arising from the&#xD;
failure of his dearest plans in life, had tinged his character&#xD;
with moroseness.&#xD;
Thus he bore the appearance of being hard; but the world&#xD;
as usual did not read him aright. True, struggling Fate had,&#xD;
left upon his exterior a tough-hued aspect, yet he carried still&#xD;
a royal nature within. You might have said, in the language&#xD;
of Franklin, that his faults were of that inverted kind, which&#xD;
makes a man appear worse than he really is.&#xD;
A fact or two, may set this point in a clearer light. If he&#xD;
could not be persuaded to unite with the leaders of the Tem-&#xD;
perance cause, it was because he lacked faith in their sin-&#xD;
cerity. If he became estranged from public worship on the&#xD;
Sabbath, he faithfully read the Bible at home, and supported&#xD;
liberally the institutions of the gospel. If he kept aloof from&#xD;
town-politics, it was because he felt a disgust at the reckless&#xD;
manouvres of narrow-minded wire pullers. If his dwelling&#xD;
was furnished in severe simplicity, and his daily table ruled&#xD;
to scanty frugality, it was because he deemed these as essen-&#xD;
tial republican virtues. It may have been further, because&#xD;
he was too persistent to lay aside habits formed in the early&#xD;

&#xD;
times of need. But on a Thanksgiving day, a wedding, or&#xD;
upon any occasion of entertaining friends, when to spread&#xD;
generously the table bears with it an expression of unstinted&#xD;
welcome, his soul was wont to Bow forth with most gracious&#xD;
liberality. And when he travelled, too, from home, he bore&#xD;
himself in a style or regal largeness. There was an ampli-&#xD;
tude in his whole character, when properly viewed, that&#xD;
abashed all meanness. Indeed, his nature seemed studded all&#xD;
over with green spots, that were really refreshing. These&#xD;
indicated a wealth of liberal spirit, that could scarcely have&#xD;
been found elsewhere, even in those good old primitive&#xD;
times, and which might now be looked for the world over in&#xD;
vain.&#xD;
For example, he never allowed himself to receive toll at&#xD;
his grist mill, from destitute widows, or the extreme poor.&#xD;
Rarely could he be prevailed upon to take pay from a neigh-&#xD;
bor for having furnished a horse for a drive. Herrings taken&#xD;
in the brook, were distributed among any who might come for&#xD;
them, after reserving a mess for his own table ; and a success-&#xD;
ful day around the Beach, seining for bass, was hailed as a&#xD;
boon in the.neighborhood. Visitors and even casual callers,&#xD;
were greeted with well filled decanters, and urged freely to&#xD;
partake. At one time, when a dearth for bread was stalking&#xD;
with threatening aspect through the settlement, and one of his&#xD;
schooners ran the gauntlet through the British squadron in&#xD;
the Chesapeake Bay, and arrived safely home, he sent every&#xD;
poor widow in town a half bushel of corn, then selling at ten&#xD;
dollars per bushel. As a thing of course, neighbors were&#xD;
always sent a cut of newly killed beef or pork. Indeed, no&#xD;
balance sheet was ever made of favors.&#xD;
But his passions were of giant strength. When fully&#xD;
aroused, the tornado was not ,more fierce ; nor the lightning&#xD;
more vengeful. He was impatient of contradiction, and his&#xD;
&#xD;
will was law. He exacted implicit deference, and whoever&#xD;
neglected to listen to the conclusion of one of his long wind6d&#xD;
stories, offended him for lifi. False pretence fared hard at&#xD;
his hands, and all manner of trickery shivered at his glance.&#xD;
Possessed of a large antique form, his muscles had grown&#xD;
to iron by exposure. The pure red English blood flowed in&#xD;
his veins, and his countenance was of that bright, deep hue,&#xD;
which is still seen here and there among the descendants of&#xD;
the early settlers of New England. In fact, he lived in that&#xD;
part of the country, where there has been the least admixture&#xD;
of foreign population, where Puritan character is found least&#xD;
alloyed, a spot that has sent from its bosom many a noble son,&#xD;
but whose barren shores present little allurement to bind the&#xD;
step of the stranger.&#xD;
Men slandered the old gentleman, who did not possess a&#xD;
tithe of his sterling character, his genuine honesty of purpose,&#xD;
his noble integrity of life. They carped at his nonconformity&#xD;
with the conventionalities of the village life, when with all his&#xD;
eccentricities, he possessed infinitely more strength and power&#xD;
of goodness than they all.&#xD;
If he could not fawn, it was because a manly impulse&#xD;
sprang up in his breast, in protest against such degradation.&#xD;
If he could not assume the guise of false seeming, in order to&#xD;
conciliate and win, it was because stern reality had become&#xD;
too interwoven into the texture of his nature, to render possi-&#xD;
ble such humiliation. He typified largely that quality of&#xD;
character found occasionally here and there in the world,&#xD;
which abhors the subterfuge of sailing under false colors, pre-&#xD;
ferring the hard alternative of being misunderstood, unappre-&#xD;
ciated, of ill-success, or in fact, of any fate, to the most daz-&#xD;
zling fortune, if accompanied by the-loss of that fresh, throb-&#xD;
bing, noble manhood, which is the first ray, the last vestige of&#xD;
the godlike in man.&#xD;

A SPECTRE.                131&#xD;
&#xD;
His quaint gray home stood upon an elevated site of&#xD;
ground, and his broad acres stretched east and west, ending&#xD;
in luxuriant woodland at the north, and descending on the&#xD;
south to the verge of the sea. The place thus commanded a&#xD;
wide sweep of the ocean, and this cold always be broadened&#xD;
by a time-worn spy-glass awaiting the curious in one corner&#xD;
of the parlor cupboard.&#xD;
When -Walter entered, he found his -grandfather seated by&#xD;
a crackling oak fire which was burning brightly in the capa-&#xD;
cious fire-place, sedately smoking a stubbed clay pipe, as was&#xD;
his wont. A   complacent grunt was -all the response he&#xD;
vouchsafed to the boy's warm but deferential salutation. But&#xD;
when Walter with all the gusto of a youthful hero, related&#xD;
the thrilling adventures of his late fishing-cruise, the whiffs&#xD;
from the pipe grew more frequent and copious, his stern fea-&#xD;
tures relaxed, and the corners of his eyes moistened with&#xD;
sympathetic pride. In reality Mr. Walfinch loved very&#xD;
deeply his grandchild, and nothing but a stern, unrelenting&#xD;
pride prevented his confessing it outright. Left to the im-&#xD;
pulse of natural emotion, he would have folded the boy to his&#xD;
bosom, adopted him as his only heir, and cherished him with&#xD;
the tenderness of a youthful lover ; so void had been his life&#xD;
of congeniality, and so much did he crave an object of&#xD;
sympathy, upon which to lavish the welled up affections of&#xD;
his heart  But our affections rarely flow in the willing chan-&#xD;
nels of the heart. Either some obstacle dams up altogether&#xD;
the swollen current, or turns it to courses repugnant to the&#xD;
instinctive impulse of love.&#xD;
Borne on by the glow of genial converse, the hours had&#xD;
flown swiftly, and the evening was now well nigh spent.&#xD;
Walter was standing near the door-way of the room, balanc-&#xD;
ing in his mind, whether he should yield to the warm, press-&#xD;
ing solicitations of the family to spend the night where he&#xD;
&#xD;
was, at his grandfather's, or be governed by what seemed the&#xD;
paramount claim, as well as expectation of his mother, for his&#xD;
society, and return immediately home, when turning casually&#xD;
around, he was suddenly struck by a strange apparition. It&#xD;
was seen by him out-doors, through one of the windows, and&#xD;
appeared like the face of a female, close to one of the window&#xD;
panes, staring wildly toward him. But before he, could col-&#xD;
lect himself from the shock which the sight gave him, suffi-&#xD;
ciently to scan the countenance, the figure had disappeared.&#xD;
This startling incident was sufficient to turn the scale in&#xD;
favor of remaining for the night, and he reeled to a seat near&#xD;
the fire. Members of the family were quick to perceive the&#xD;
striking change in the manner of the boy, but no one could&#xD;
divine the reason, nor would any one summon resolution to&#xD;
inquire.&#xD;
Erewhile Walter was conducted to his sleeping apartment.&#xD;
It was of that severe simplicity to remind one of primitive&#xD;
times. Very narrow, with wainscoted walls, unpainted, the&#xD;
only furniture was a single chair, a cherry-wood, crow-foot&#xD;
stand, and a small antique mirror, suspended obliquely from&#xD;
the wall. The counterpane of the bed was of woollen, and&#xD;
was a veritable product of the domestic loom. Upon the&#xD;
stand lay a bible, with heavy metallic clasps. Adown the&#xD;
only window of the apartment, hung a curtain, and it and the&#xD;
pillow-cases, were of snowy whiteness. Indeed, the closest&#xD;
eye could scarcely have detected so much as a stain, or parti-&#xD;
cle of dust within the precincts of the room. An embalmed&#xD;
air of neatness pervaded the apartment, so palpable as to lay&#xD;
hold of the sense.&#xD;
Walter lay with eyes opened, ruminating long upon the&#xD;
spectacle that had so excited him anew. He could not doubt&#xD;
its being the same that had so quickened his footsteps, on&#xD;
coming hither, and he thought to trace a resemblance between&#xD;

THE FISHER BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
the face and the one he met a few weeks before upon the&#xD;
tiny bridge.  There was the same deep, suffering look,&#xD;
with a strange pertinacity to hang around his pathway. But&#xD;
who could this mysterious being be; whence came she ; and&#xD;
what was her design upon the boy, that she was thus follow-&#xD;
ing upon his footsteps like a haunting ghost.&#xD;
Excited conceptions of curdling stories, that had been pic-&#xD;
tured by the superstitious upon his childhood mind, began&#xD;
moving athwart his distenipered brain in spectral troops;&#xD;
when lo, and behold, springs before his excited eye-batlls, an-&#xD;
other apparition ! It seems to issue from the depths of the&#xD;
dusky air; it settles slowly toward him, and becomes fixed&#xD;
over his breast. le cannot be mistaken. It is the same face&#xD;
he met upon the bridge; and the identical one, he had just&#xD;
seen through the window. He cannot now avoid, if he will,&#xD;
a scrutinizing look. Her hair hangs in wild, dishevelled tres-&#xD;
ses. A deep, entranced glow beams from her wild, burning&#xD;
eyes. But upon her brow there appears enthroned a calm,&#xD;
holy will, and there seems to play about her mouth, the angel&#xD;
smile of Hope.&#xD;
There was thus nothing sinister in the expression of the&#xD;
face, and Walter would have spoken to the phantom, but his&#xD;
tongue refused utterance. He tried to arouse from his pos-&#xD;
ture, but he seemed pinioned to the spot.&#xD;
At length, when his faculties became collected, the spectre&#xD;
melted back into the darkness. He now sprang from his bed,&#xD;
but his knees were tremulous with weakness. A cold sweat lay&#xD;
upon his forehead, and the air of the room seemed failing him&#xD;
of breath. He threw open the window, to sniff the fresh air&#xD;
of heaven; and throwing on his clothes, lie escaped out-doors,&#xD;
but all was quiet and natural. The stars in the upper deep&#xD;
were shining with undimmed lustre. Several headland lights&#xD;
were gleaming from afar athwart the water, with constancy of&#xD;
&#xD;
blaze. The roaring distant surf came gently floating in low&#xD;
diapason upon the midnight air. A whispering breeze sighed&#xD;
mellifluously through the verdant pines near, and the old&#xD;
family dog came and licked sympathetically Walter's hand, as&#xD;
if to assure him that there was nothing to fear in the sur-&#xD;
rounding world of darkness.&#xD;
Ashamed of his own trepidation, and fearful of awaking the&#xD;
family, he returned quietly to his room, but it was not till&#xD;
Aurora began streaking the east with rosy light, that he could&#xD;
compose himself for repose.&#xD;
When that wary band of sentinels, the nervous system, has&#xD;
once been overpowered by fright, either by the presence of&#xD;
real danger, or by t le illusions of the imagination, not unfre-&#xD;
quently, the slightest touch by the phantom-finger, in the&#xD;
choir of our association, is sufficient to reproduce in exaggera-&#xD;
ted horror the original object of our terror.&#xD;

ENLIVENING SCENE.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
&#xD;
"There's language in her eye, her cheek, her lip,&#xD;
Nay, her foot speaks, her wanton spirits look out&#xD;
At every joint and motion of her body."&#xD;
SIAKSPEARE.&#xD;
&#xD;
"DOES she 'lay her course," demanded the skipper of&#xD;
Marl.&#xD;
" Aye, and a point free," was the gruff response.&#xD;
The latter speaker (in a musing mood) was standing&#xD;
astride the little crooked tiller, which he was sculling from&#xD;
side to side, as if to aid the Pink in her plodding course.&#xD;
" Then keep her full and by," resumed the skipper, "We'll&#xD;
put enough into the pot. Those clouds look like giving us&#xD;
the wind more from the westward, toward midnight."&#xD;
"Aye, aye," reiterated the Salt, with a true twang of a son&#xD;
of Neptune.&#xD;
The vessel had now got past the Cape, and Highland&#xD;
Light was gleaming serenely over the undulating water.&#xD;
"Another gallon to your score, eh, my lad," chuckled Fish-&#xD;
all, who had just come out of the cabin, smoking a newly,&#xD;
lighted pipe, so short as to answer the double purpose of lux-&#xD;
uriating in the weed, and, at the same time, keeping warm a&#xD;
somewhat protruding nose.&#xD;
Walter with great simplicity ventured to ask what the reck-&#xD;
oning meant.&#xD;
"Why, 'tis an old custom," replied Fishall, "that boys pay&#xD;
a gallon of liquor for every light they pass. It goes to treat&#xD;
(134)&#xD;
&#xD;
all hands, and is called paying the Footing. You'll follow&#xD;
suit, of course."&#xD;
"Balh," muttered Marl, "Don't get alarmed, before you're&#xD;
in danger. The boy'll do his part, I'll be bound, not a mean&#xD;
thread in the fellow."&#xD;
The faithful Pink kept her way, bobbing along over the&#xD;
tiny waves, which swelled in size, as they drew away from&#xD;
the winding Cape, into the broad bosomed bay.&#xD;
Weary of the pitchy prospect, and drooping with fatigue,&#xD;
the boy stole away to his bunk.&#xD;
When he awoke in the morning, it was broad daylight.&#xD;
The cook had turned out, and was bustling away toward pre-&#xD;
paring breakfast. But the rest of the crew, overcome with&#xD;
exhaustion in working up the harbor, were still buried in&#xD;
slumber. Their deep respiration showed well enough, that&#xD;
they were afar off in the land of dreams.&#xD;
But Walter was too full of curiosity, to remain willingly in&#xD;
the cabin. As he reached the deck? he was struck at once&#xD;
with wonder. The magic city, its interminable roar of life,&#xD;
the heterogeneous flash of activity, the gay craft in the har-&#xD;
bor, all made up a scene which to the youthful eye of the boy&#xD;
seemed enchantment itself. It sprang upon his maidenly&#xD;
sense, like awaking to celestial visions. He could scarcely&#xD;
have felt more wondrously excited, if he had found himself in&#xD;
a new world.&#xD;
Nestling upon the heel of the bowsprit, he sat distracted,&#xD;
gazing around in mute delight. His rustic eye, pellucid in&#xD;
the freshness of Nature, was enthralled in the mazy charm&#xD;
of Art.&#xD;
Breakfast ov r, all hands were mustered to heave the ves-&#xD;
sel into the wharf. Lines being run and anchor weighed, the&#xD;
movement began briskly. Walter was sent in the boat along&#xD;
with Fishall; but for once the boy did not acquit himself so&#xD;
&#xD;

THE FISHER BOY'&#xD;
&#xD;
WALK ABOUT BOSTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
acceptably as was his wont. The dazzle and clash of novel&#xD;
scenes and voices overcame his self-control. More than once,&#xD;
he found himself as motionless as a statue, absorbed by some&#xD;
striking object, quite oblivious to the duty before him. This&#xD;
could not fail to bring him under the lash of Fishall. It net-&#xD;
tIed too the skipper out of his imperturbable placidity. And&#xD;
even Marl could not refrain a rebuke, advising the boy to quit&#xD;
star-gazing and look to his business. They did not perceive&#xD;
this remissness to be but the natural working of an ingenuous&#xD;
nature in the boy - a spirit that augured an elastic step in&#xD;
the world's climbings.&#xD;
As an interval must elapse before they could commence&#xD;
receiving on board the salt and stores, the day following their&#xD;
arrival was one of absolute leisure. It was passed by the&#xD;
crew in that state of beguiling indolence, which the occupa-&#xD;
tion of fishing seems so fitted to transfuse into the nature.&#xD;
But in the evening, it. was proposed to make a stroll in the&#xD;
city by way of recreation. This was- favored by acclamation.&#xD;
Especially was Walter in ecstasy at the anticipation of ac-&#xD;
tually seeing Boston, and thus realizing a splendid day-dream&#xD;
of his boyhood.&#xD;
Accordingly, taking a harbor-wash, and donning their best&#xD;
go-a-shore habiliments, they stood in their shoes amazingly&#xD;
elevated in a delicate feeling of self-respect. To be sure,&#xD;
they could not be reckoned finely dressed, but they felt as&#xD;
hearty a sense of that indefinable charm that accompanies the&#xD;
renovation of the outward man, as could the daintiest fashion-&#xD;
able, attired for the faultless elegancies of a lady's drawing-&#xD;
room.&#xD;
Off they blithely started, suddenly changed in appearance&#xD;
from the men they had been during the day, while lazily&#xD;
yawning upon the spars and coils of rigging on board. In-&#xD;
deed, they would hardly have been taken for the same beings.&#xD;
&#xD;
A new element had transformed them. The glow of vivacity&#xD;
that lifts the feelings on stepping ashore from confinement on&#xD;
board a vessel, can scarcely be imagined by a landsman.&#xD;
The embrace of mother-earth seems redolent with affection.&#xD;
The mingling current of warm fellow life, imparts a sympa-&#xD;
thetic flow to our feelings.&#xD;
Marl being best acquainted with the city, led the way, with&#xD;
the view of glancing at such notable parts as might be most&#xD;
conveniently passed in the scanty time they had for the tour.&#xD;
The rest followed under that sentiment of deference we natu-&#xD;
rally feel for superiority. As for Walter, he was in a tittila-&#xD;
tion of anticipation. What wonders of beauty were to break&#xD;
upon his enraptured gaze !&#xD;
On reaching Washington street, his bright hopes were&#xD;
more than realized. The dazzling splendor of light, the&#xD;
sweeping by of elegantly attired people, the dash and anima-&#xD;
tion of superb vehicles, the majesty of lofty and massive edi-&#xD;
fices, the magnificence of the shops, made up a scene that be-&#xD;
wildered his sense with delightful curiosity. To his en-&#xD;
tranced vision, it was a magic scene, touched with a fairy life.&#xD;
His faculties were in a high state of agreeable excitement.&#xD;
He could have lingered long- amid the bright conceptions of&#xD;
his teeming brain, and he felt a sweet glow of gratitude for&#xD;
the happiness he inwardly felt.&#xD;
How keen the emotions of youth, as the susceptible facul-&#xD;
ties, opening upon a world of nature and art are kept in a&#xD;
perpetual glow of delightful wonder, while -each successive&#xD;
scene- unfolding to view, keeps up the enchantment. How&#xD;
unhappy that this glorious hallucination of soul should ever&#xD;
cease, -that there should be a time when the scenes of life&#xD;
have lost their charm, - a single moment in our brief span,&#xD;
when all the matchless contrivances of art, or the sublime&#xD;
wonders of Nature in her endless transformations, should pall&#xD;

upon the soul! But is such a state natural? May it not be&#xD;
a moral perversion of the sensibilities, a condition of spiritual&#xD;
distemper?  Are not Nature and Art ample to keep alive&#xD;
with freshened interest the unfolding faculties, until disein-&#xD;
bodied, the soul wings its transit to an abode where all is pe-&#xD;
rennial joy?&#xD;
"There," remarked Marl, as they wended along the prim&#xD;
walks of the Common, or Mall, as it was then called, " There&#xD;
rises the -Old Liberty Tree. If some gracious Genii were to&#xD;
endow it with a tongue, what a burning tale might it not un-&#xD;
fold. It could tell of many a thought-wombed council held&#xD;
under its protecting-shadow, at a time when the spirit ' of&#xD;
Freedom was travailing for birth upon the new world. And&#xD;
does your eye ken that shadowy building upon the right, that&#xD;
crowns our modern Athens, as St. Paul's rears its mighty&#xD;
dome above the mammoth London?    Well, that's our-proud,&#xD;
old, noble State House, and no mean piece of architecture is&#xD;
it either. Its summit commands a prospect, that does a New&#xD;
Englander'sheart good to embrace. Below, upon tablets of&#xD;
stone, one reads sublime memorials of the tempestuous pas-&#xD;
sages of our forefathers, in their dark voyage to Independ-&#xD;
ence. But the most grateful object for contemplation of all,&#xD;
is a full sized statue of Washington himself, the glorious cap-&#xD;
tain that steered our frail Ship of State safely across the&#xD;
howling waters of the Revolution; and who, take him All in&#xD;
all, was, I conclude, a little the noblest piece of humanity big-.&#xD;
wombed time has ever given birth to."&#xD;
By this time, Walter had pressed close up to the Salt, and&#xD;
was drinking in, as-it were, the very breath of his sentences.&#xD;
" That large edifice," continued the sailor, "that I pointed&#xD;
out as we came along,-is the Old Cradle of Liberty, so called,&#xD;
because here amid the lullaby surges of a seven years' war,&#xD;
was rocked into being an infant empire.&#xD;
&#xD;
SIGHT--SEEING.&#xD;
&#xD;
139&#xD;
&#xD;
"And off yonder, -to the north-east, rises Bunker's or&#xD;
rather Breed's Hill, where the haughty Britishers first&#xD;
caught a specimen of Yankee pluck. Daddy Bull here wo-&#xD;
fully found, that he'd just sent over his son Jonathan to pick&#xD;
out the eyes of the sire. -Ah, no monument's needed to,&#xD;
guide the American heart to this spot; for the sacred place&#xD;
is not only engraved in lines of fire upon the country's soul,&#xD;
but 'tis enshrined in the memory of heroism throughout the&#xD;
world. Wherever a noble hart shall throb for liberty, there&#xD;
will be heaved a generous sigh for the heaven-born sacrifices&#xD;
that cluster around this spot.&#xD;
"A little this side of Bunker Hill, is the Navy Yard. 'Tis&#xD;
here that preparations are kept up for engaging the enemy on&#xD;
the sea. And thoroughly is the work done, too. No botch-&#xD;
work there, I assure you. 'Tis all complete order and sys-&#xD;
tem; and everybody there, has to toe the mark. You'd see&#xD;
there, my boy, some big guns, and whopping ships, all kept&#xD;
as prig and shiny as a pewter platter.&#xD;
"You seem posted up in these matters," interposed Marl.&#xD;
"And why shouldn't I be," returned the Salt, "after going&#xD;
seven years at sea in the service, and two in the Yard.&#xD;
That's enough, I conclude, to get a tolerable acquaintance&#xD;
with Uncle Sam."&#xD;
"And how did you like the old gentleman," demanded&#xD;
Fishall.&#xD;
" Why to confess," growled Marl, "none of the best, or I'd&#xD;
been there now. le's rather an exacting master with the&#xD;
lesser tribe of his servants, but then he doesn't always forget&#xD;
them who serve him well."&#xD;
Here the company falling in with a couple of benches, very&#xD;
opportunely placed along the walks for loiterers, they seated&#xD;
themselves, and began yielding to the veering current of talk.&#xD;

140             THE FISHER - BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
snch trivial remarks as the circumstances suggested, Walter&#xD;
was absorbed in the amazing panorama that had just swept&#xD;
athwart his vision, like the corruscations of a gorgeous dIrean.&#xD;
His mind turned to prying into the meaning of what he had&#xD;
seen. Theirs was a glancing eye that flitted upon the sur-&#xD;
- face; his a deeper look, that strove to penetrate below. As&#xD;
for Marl, the golden associations of his youth, reawakened by&#xD;
the presence of familiar objects, loosed his tongue, which rat-&#xD;
tled on with a volubility in marked contrast with his usual&#xD;
taciturnity.&#xD;
" Why how very greatly in haste everybody appeared to be&#xD;
as we came along. They seemed hurrying on after some&#xD;
sight, or fleeing quickly from danger," thoughtfully observed&#xD;
Walter.&#xD;
"Neither," interrupted Marl, "a habit, only a habit, that's&#xD;
all, my boy. The city you must know's little more than a&#xD;
vast beehive where people throng to heap up riches. The&#xD;
intense struggle for success arouses the energies to the fullest,&#xD;
and this comes insensibly to affect even the ordinary move-&#xD;
ments of the body. The current of life in these huge marts&#xD;
of trade, does not flow evenly, as with you adown the coun-&#xD;
try, but sweeps along in enormous whirlpools, into the vor-&#xD;
tices of which all are drawn by the mere force of circum-&#xD;
stances."&#xD;
"But how very nice it must be, just to live among so really&#xD;
sociable people, and so agreeable," continued Walter.&#xD;
"A slight optical illusion that, as they'd say over yonder&#xD;
at Harvard. I must tell you that the bulk of the city people&#xD;
are not half as well acquainted with each other, as your coun-&#xD;
try folks are, nor do they spend near so much time as the lat-&#xD;
ter, in cordial social converse, and mutual kindly offices..&#xD;
True, the city brings the bodies of people together, but it sep-&#xD;
arates their minds.&#xD;
&#xD;
"But how   very polite, everybody appeared," persisted&#xD;
Walter.&#xD;
" Say affable, rather, my boy. Politeness is a wordaof&#xD;
deeper import. It springs from a native source, and is- often&#xD;
seen from under the roughest exterior. It flows from the&#xD;
well-spring of goodness. Its basis is integrity, and its super-&#xD;
structure benevolence. In fact, 'tis simply kindness- kindly&#xD;
expressed. Whereas, the gracious manner you notice is very&#xD;
much a matter of fashion or policy. Where the true charac-&#xD;
ter is not seen, a person is rated at what he seems, and this&#xD;
begets a habit of condescending courtesy towards whom it is&#xD;
the policy to conciliate."&#xD;
"Then how finely dressed they all were," continued the&#xD;
boy, apparently without thinking that lie was opposing the&#xD;
sailor.&#xD;
"Gloss, gloss," growled Marl, that adds not a whit to worth&#xD;
of character. Artificial bodies they are, that tailors and man-&#xD;
tuamakers make. Do ye know, that fondness for decoration&#xD;
in dress, is but an Indian trait at best, and not the most admi-&#xD;
rable one in the category, at that?  Dress, 'tis a sinful thing;&#xD;
and the fashion of it as arbitrary as a tyrant ; as unrelenting&#xD;
as Death; and as unblushing as crime itself. It turns the&#xD;
body into a legion of unnatural shapes, and sets people's wits&#xD;
agog. It pads up and glosses over the hideous spiritual de-&#xD;
formity of people, giving the same faultless elegance to the&#xD;
most rickety and grovelling being, as to a soul of the divinest&#xD;
mould. 'Tis a mighty leveller, rolling down individual supe-&#xD;
riority, and imprinting society with factitious hues. But the&#xD;
worst about dress is, that it helps lure off the mind from the&#xD;
true objects of life, and fix it upon the most trivial of human&#xD;
aims. Ah, my boy, real beauty is not so much a thing con-&#xD;
jured up by human device, as a native plant carefully nur-&#xD;
tured within the soul.&#xD;

CITY AND COUNTRY LIFE.        143&#xD;
&#xD;
"But the people all appeared so intelligent," drawled the&#xD;
boy.&#xD;
%A slight illusion there, again," retorted Marl, rather&#xD;
sharply. " Saving a limited class of cultivated persons of lei-&#xD;
sure, the people of the city are not so well informed in mat-&#xD;
ters of general import, as are the folks in the country. The&#xD;
city people may show more pertness, may have certain con-&#xD;
ventional notions and forms of speech, which they get a glib-&#xD;
ness in by eternally repeating -a certain prettiness of talk;&#xD;
but in strength of judgment, depth of intelligence, or original-&#xD;
ity of thought, they are far behind the better class of country&#xD;
folks."&#xD;
"So delightful to be where one can go to shows, to specta-&#xD;
cles, to concerts; and then how grand to be surrounded by so&#xD;
splendid objects. Why, 'tis glorious just to live in such a&#xD;
place," persisted Walter.&#xD;
"Whew, boy. A touch of the reality would bring down&#xD;
that enthusiasm a peg or two, I fancy," sarcastically rejoined&#xD;
Marl. " Let me tell you, that it takes a little of the rhino, to&#xD;
follow up such places of amusement; and a surplus of the&#xD;
precious article is not what every city man even has to spare.&#xD;
With the ma'ss of the denizens of a city, 'tis a struggle for life&#xD;
from hand to mouth; or a more intense struggle to escape the&#xD;
whirlpool of bankruptcy. Then, the frugal business man has&#xD;
a certain maxim, bequeathed him   by that old sage, Ben&#xD;
Franklin. This, he holds as his chart and compass for suc-&#xD;
cess. It is this: "That Time is Money."  Now, it unwinds&#xD;
the short thread of life a little too rapidly to be running after&#xD;
shows. Most, whose business, like a hard master, keeps them&#xD;
early and late, when once the day is over, are quite content&#xD;
to nestle snugly down, and rest their jaded faculties for the&#xD;
routine of the morrow's sun. And whenever these do start&#xD;
off for a moment's relaxation, their faculties have been so&#xD;
&#xD;
overworked, as to be unfitted for the enjoyment of a perform-&#xD;
ance. For you must know, that the interest of an exhibition&#xD;
depends more upon the listener than upon the actor. Most&#xD;
who go to the -city, go there to make much money quickly,&#xD;
and then retire ; and so enchained are they to this intent, as&#xD;
to find little gratification in aught else. This controlling de-&#xD;
sire obscures everything besides.&#xD;
"As for splendor, as you term it, the bright novelty of that&#xD;
soon wears away, and with it goes the charm, like the cheat-&#xD;
ing mirage of a summer sea. It fades like the pleasing lustre&#xD;
of a new house. Even the few of leisure who have little else&#xD;
for occupation, than to gild the flagging hours, become aweary&#xD;
of their dulcet life, and the most cunning device for enliven-&#xD;
ment, soon palls upon the sensibilities, like the surfeit of a&#xD;
rich banquet. Yes, he continued, waxing warmer, I'd rather&#xD;
be the raggedest plough-boy in the country, so I could have&#xD;
the open sky above, the blue hills before, and the breezes of&#xD;
heaven blowing freely around me, than your newest starched&#xD;
gent, in Washington Street, imprisoned among finery, and&#xD;
dancing attendance to the wiles of Trade. One quaff from&#xD;
the fount of Nature, is worth to me all the trickery of Art&#xD;
that can be mustered."&#xD;
"Yes," urged the boy, growing more bold, "but then 'tis&#xD;
only a little while, struggling so. After gaining a fortune,&#xD;
they can retire to a handsome country seat, and enjoy their&#xD;
wealth; and how nice this must be."&#xD;
"Only a few years, eh," retorted Marl, snappishly. "Ah,&#xD;
my dear fellow, 'tis generally a long passage, let me assure&#xD;
you, ere those who embark upon the uncertain sea of trade,&#xD;
reach the glittering port of wealth; and only the merest frag-&#xD;
ment of such as set out, ever find the port at all. Most run&#xD;
bolt upon the rocks of pure miscalculation, leaving their frag-&#xD;
ments wide floating for common plunder ; or are driven&#xD;

ashore high and dry, by the furious gales of mischance, a&#xD;
prey to the greedy wrecker; or what is still worse, founder&#xD;
in heavy weather at sea, when down they sink, straight into&#xD;
the remorseless jaws of hungry creditors,"&#xD;
"Some, after having successfully braved the perils of the&#xD;
voyage, go down with all on board, just in sight of port. This&#xD;
is the hardest fate of all. 'Twas the dark misfortune of my&#xD;
own poor father to be one of these. After a life of intense&#xD;
industry, his head silvered by hard devotion to trade, just .on&#xD;
the eve of retiring to spend the twilight of his days at a mag-&#xD;
nificent country-villa, nearly completed for him; by some un-&#xD;
lucky endorsement, he made a dreadful slip-bend, and his for-&#xD;
tune flew, as upon the wings of the wind. A horde of cred-&#xD;
itors pounced upon him, as if he were a common felon. Good,&#xD;
dear mother, died under the shock. Father lingered but a&#xD;
few years. Angel sister, the purest spirit of earth,-and&#xD;
here the veterans sailor covered for a moment his face with&#xD;
his hands, while his .stalwart frame shook with convulsive&#xD;
emotion, -now that the cloud of adversity had burst upon us,&#xD;
was deserted by the hollow-hearted youngster, to whom in&#xD;
her guileless innocence, she had confided her pure affection,&#xD;
- when she, too, like a sweet flower, cut by the ruthless&#xD;
scythe, drooped under the stroke, and gently fell into the cold,&#xD;
unfeeling earth,-and I -I took to the sea, to hide myself&#xD;
from the face of men, and wash away the remembrance of my&#xD;
misfortune, in the storms of the ocean."&#xD;
Again the rugged sailor covered his face, and remained a&#xD;
few moments in silence, his powerful frame heaving all the&#xD;
time, with deep emotion, from the mastery of bitter remem-&#xD;
brances, mingled, it may be, with a twinge of remorse, for&#xD;
having dropped so unwarily a clue to his life, about which he&#xD;
had ever before maintained the most pertinacious reserve.&#xD;
Walter had pressed closely up to the stricken man in sym-&#xD;
&#xD;
pathetic reverence, while the rest of the crew, struck with&#xD;
commiseration, preserved a thoughtful silence.&#xD;
At length, brightening serenely up, like the sunbeam face of&#xD;
a shadowy cloud, the sailor resumed. "The very few who&#xD;
make a successful voyage, and retire with the coveted leisure&#xD;
and abundance, find their sympathies to have been so nar-&#xD;
rowed by intense action in a single line of pursuit, as to ren-&#xD;
der plain, natural life destitute of genuine relish. Besides,&#xD;
their minds so long active, crave by habit, continued excite-&#xD;
ment. They soon pine from pure lack of occupation. The&#xD;
truth now bursts upon them. In the exclusive pursuit of&#xD;
wealth, they have been chasing a mere phantom. Its Will o'&#xD;
the Wisp light has lured them off' the upland air of humanity,&#xD;
into the swampy mazes of selfishness."&#xD;
"Still," persisted the boy, "it must be very pleasant living&#xD;
in the city."&#xD;
"A very natural inference for a youngster to make," quoth&#xD;
the sailor. " But there is a slight difference between fact and&#xD;
Fancy, my boy. Many a scene, bright to the ardent eye of&#xD;
youth, proves on inspection, but a dissolving view. The city&#xD;
is but a larger theatre. At a distance, the shifting scenes are&#xD;
mazy with magic beauty, and the painted actors fascinate us&#xD;
by their lordly strut and fine frenzy of manner. But a peep&#xD;
behind the curtain dissolves the illusion. We see but the&#xD;
bloated body of Bacchus, the rattling bones in the valley of&#xD;
Death, the reverse side of a gilded vesture, bald and tawdry.&#xD;
It has a fair form to look upon, but its breath is foul and con-&#xD;
tagious. If you would continue the illusion, approach not too&#xD;
near, nor look too close into its hidden mysteries. The en-&#xD;
amored of the city think to embrace spiritual beauty, but&#xD;
awake hugging hut a deformed carcass."&#xD;
"But for one, I'd like to have wealth," exclaimed the boy,&#xD;
glad to save something from the wreck of his argument.&#xD;

146              THE FISHER BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Very like," rejoined the sailor, "but great possessions&#xD;
often prove but a millstone to drown a man in his own waters.&#xD;
An uncultivated rich man is something in the situation of an&#xD;
ant upon a fat carcass. He is in possession of an abundance,&#xD;
but can take only up to his narrow capacity of enjoyment.&#xD;
As for the rest, he is at most but a guardian for others to use&#xD;
or enjoy, - but a sentinel at the temple of wealth. It can&#xD;
hardly soothe the pillow of a dying man, to feel that he must&#xD;
leave behind what it has cost a lifetime to acquire, especially&#xD;
if he knows it will, go to a band of dissolute relatives, to be&#xD;
scattered to the four corners of the earth."&#xD;
The passing of loiterers had now nearly ceased, and feeling&#xD;
a chilly sensation from the damp of the evening, and from&#xD;
their long sitting, they all began motioning to return.&#xD;
" Do you really mean what you've said," asked Fishall; "is&#xD;
there no good in the city ?"&#xD;
"I grant that there is," replied Marl, "but I like to take&#xD;
off the feathery edge of the boy's enthusiasm."&#xD;
" Well, I think 'tis very convenient, at any rate, to have a&#xD;
rich father," cautiously ventured Fishall.&#xD;
"Convenient, aye, but is convenience to be thought of in&#xD;
the battle for success?" bridled up Marl, a little touched at&#xD;
the unexpected opposition. "Did you not know, that the&#xD;
successful men have sprung nearly always from poor parents?&#xD;
Self-dependence tends to bring the requisite self-reliance and&#xD;
energy for success. Indeed, as human nature is, a father can&#xD;
scarcely entail a greater curse upon his child, than riches.&#xD;
The very notion of the child that he is independent, takes&#xD;
away all motive for effort, and the possession itself induces&#xD;
imbecility."&#xD;
" But you wouldn't object to having enough to set a son up&#xD;
in business ?" asked Fishall.&#xD;
" That, Gftener than otherwise, does more harm than good,"&#xD;
&#xD;
replied Marl; "give a youngster capital to commence trade&#xD;
with, and ten to one, but he'll fail from sheer inexperience.&#xD;
On the contrary, let him earn his capital, and he is gaining his&#xD;
money and experience together, so that, by the time he has&#xD;
accumulated the requisite capital, he has the experience skil-&#xD;
fully to us  it."&#xD;
"I don't quite see how that is," demured Fishall.&#xD;
"Well, let me try to make it plain. Put a young man in&#xD;
command of a large, fine ship at once, and likely asnot he'll&#xD;
soon lose her. But let him begin with the command of a&#xD;
boat, and so work his way up, until he gets the ship, he then&#xD;
has gained experience to take care of her."&#xD;
Fishall was silent. He felt the force of the sailor's rea-&#xD;
soning; and he was too unsophisticated to argue for the sake&#xD;
of arguing.&#xD;
They wended along vesselward. But reaching a business&#xD;
street, the roving eye of Fishall caught sight of a red flag&#xD;
over a spacious door-way. Persons were passing up and&#xD;
down a broad flight of stairs, and the sharp voice of an auc-&#xD;
tioneer was heard in the room above.&#xD;
"Let's go in a while," urged Fishall, "'tis not late."&#xD;
"Nonsense," growled Marl, "some Peter Funk concern.&#xD;
You are sure of getting sold in such places; and of coming&#xD;
away with a lighter purse,'less esteem for human nature, as&#xD;
well as a loss of self-respect."&#xD;
But the allurement of the place, triumphed over the advise&#xD;
of Marl, and they all went up, except the sailor, who turned&#xD;
off to another store for a purchase of his own.&#xD;
The room, brightly lighted, was packed with a motley&#xD;
throng. Dusty maps andgaudy paintings were hung around&#xD;
upon the walls. Tawdry articles were exposed here . and&#xD;
there to view. A tall, slim man, with a keen eye and wiry&#xD;
face, was mounted upon a desk, attending to the sales. By&#xD;

&#xD;
his side was an attendant, and in a corner was a book-&#xD;
keeper.&#xD;
As they entered the room there was a hush amid the com-&#xD;
pany, but the auctioneer bustled with livelier activity.&#xD;
"Well," broke forth the man of sales, "IHere's something&#xD;
will take your eye, I'll be bound," pulling out at the same&#xD;
time a paper-case, containing a medley of articles. "If you&#xD;
can't get suited here, gentlemen, you're hard to please, -sil-&#xD;
ver-watch, gold pencil-case, magnificent breast-pin, and other&#xD;
articles too numerous to mention ; from a gentleman's tooth-&#xD;
pick, to ear-rings fit for an empress. Just look here "-hold-&#xD;
ing up to view, and displaying a massive ring, profusely&#xD;
loaded with stones. " Here's a little article that lord Ches-&#xD;
terfield himself would have felt proud in wearing."&#xD;
"Now how much shall I have a-piece for the lot. Mind&#xD;
ye, I sell the whole for so much a-piece. Make me a bid,&#xD;
gentlemen. How much shall I have - one dollar - seventy-&#xD;
five cents - fifty -twenty cents - anything you please, gen-&#xD;
tlemen. How much, I say, how -   "&#xD;
"Four pence ha'penny," struck out a voice from amid the&#xD;
crowd.&#xD;
"Four pence bid," responded with a jerk, the auctioneer;&#xD;
"thank ye, sir --generous;" then suppressing a laugh, with&#xD;
a mock show of dignity, and drawling out the words, "f-o-u-r&#xD;
p-e-n-c-e. Why gentlemen, here's one article "-disp'laying&#xD;
a heavy yellow metallic chain ; "that's worth the whole&#xD;
amount, at that rate, and leave you the rest for nothing. -&#xD;
Four pence ha'penny a-piece for the, lot. Well, gentlemen,&#xD;
I'm bound to sell them at some price. They must be sold to&#xD;
close a consignment-and sell them I will -four pence'-&#xD;
going, going -shall I have ten cents, nine, eight, seven?"&#xD;
" Seven cents," echoed another voice.&#xD;
"Thank ye. Seven cents - seven, shall I have eight ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Eight cents," issued from another corner.&#xD;
"Eight cents ; shall I have nine?"&#xD;
"Nine cents," followed another bid.&#xD;
"Nine cents, going, going, gone "-and down came the&#xD;
hammer with a bound.&#xD;
" To whom - who takes it at nine cents ; whose bid?"&#xD;
"Mr. Frazier."&#xD;
"Mr. Frazier - charge to Mr. Frazier."&#xD;
There was an eager curiosity to see the purchase. The&#xD;
box was accordingly passed charily around, amid an occa-&#xD;
sional ejaculation of wonder, at the riclmess of the bargain.&#xD;
"Ah, here's one more, interrupted the auctioneer," pulling&#xD;
along another box, "just one more left. Who'll take this at&#xD;
the same price ? Who'll have it? --a bargain for some one."&#xD;
"French," resounded from the middle of the crowd.&#xD;
"Mr. French, charge to Mr. French," shouted the auc-&#xD;
tioneer.&#xD;
" leighho - two more," exclaimed the man of sales, as the&#xD;
attendant clerk placed two more boxes before him, "I thought&#xD;
we had the last."&#xD;
A conversation now in an under tone took place between&#xD;
them, seemingly about the apparent mistake.&#xD;
"Well, they must be sold at any rate," resumed the auc-&#xD;
tioneer. " Who'll take another, at the same price.?" speaking&#xD;
in an unconcerned tone and manner.&#xD;
"Bodfish," spoke out a voice.&#xD;
"Mr. Bodfish; charge to Mr. Bodfish."&#xD;
"One box now left, just one more. Who'll take it, gentle-&#xD;
men? The last you'll have, on my word. Who takes it?&#xD;
Another can't be bought for ten times the money, no, not for&#xD;
any price. Who has it?"&#xD;
"By this time, Fishall had got thoroughly excited; and&#xD;
having found that he could borrow some dollar or so, of&#xD;

change, from one of the crew -breathed out that he would&#xD;
take it.&#xD;
"Who?" inquired the auctioneer, leaning forward to catch&#xD;
the voice.&#xD;
"Fishall," spoke out the fisherman, quiveringly.&#xD;
"Fishall, ah yes, Mr. Fishall. Step up, Mr. Fishall, and&#xD;
take your goods. Make way gentlemen for Mr. Fishall.&#xD;
Here, Mr. Clerk, attend to Mr. Fishall."&#xD;
Fishall at length reached the counter, and was there po-&#xD;
litely informed, that his purchase amounted to $75.28. The&#xD;
fisherman was struck aghast. He could not believe it. The&#xD;
clerk counted the articles, and made it plain before his eyes.&#xD;
But $75--a summer's voyage of itself. He was in conster-&#xD;
nation, and began stammering out something about not.know-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
"Ah, that's your game," screamed the auctioneer, "but no&#xD;
tricks. We take no jokes. Come, pay up, sir, or we'll put&#xD;
you in the way of doing it. We can't wait to chop logic."&#xD;
Walter perceiving Fishall's embarrassment, made a push&#xD;
forward ,to reach his side. In his way, a burly youngster&#xD;
stamped- upon his foot, and then squared round, and gruffly&#xD;
demanded why Walter had trodden upon his toes. There&#xD;
began a turmoil of sensation in the room. Fishall strove for&#xD;
a release from his bargain on the score of ignorance, but his&#xD;
broken-speech apology was only made the butt of coarse wit-&#xD;
ticism. He then essayed a compromise by offering all the&#xD;
money in his purse for a release. But this proposition only&#xD;
increased the earnestness of the auctioneer.&#xD;
" Eh, you long-shore fishmonger you. I'll warrant the had-&#xD;
dock bones are this minute sticking out of your sides, like&#xD;
quills from the back of a porcupine. You come up here with&#xD;
your gurry-butt blarney," screamed the man of sales, at the&#xD;
same time swinging his hammer with the flourish of a&#xD;
&#xD;
French Fencing Master. "I'll teach you, I will, how to jole&#xD;
a cod."&#xD;
Fishall was of a peaceful nature, but such burning words&#xD;
were not to be brooked. Throwing a glance of ineffable con-&#xD;
tempt, accompanied by a gesture of defiance at the auctioneer,&#xD;
he made a rush for the door of the room. The crowd pressed&#xD;
around to cut off his retreat, but once fairly aroused, the ath-&#xD;
letic fisherman ploughed his way through them, and down the&#xD;
stair-way amid the noise and scuffle. The rest of the crew&#xD;
succeeded with difficulty in following him.&#xD;
Walter was the last. But on reaching the stair-way two&#xD;
or three youngsters pounced upon his neck, with the view&#xD;
evidently of wrenching off his grasp from the banister, and&#xD;
precipitating him headlong into the street. And before he&#xD;
could disentangle their wily attack, another big chap gave&#xD;
him a tremendous blow upon the back of his head, which sent&#xD;
the boy fairly twirling down the stair-way, and sprawling&#xD;
upon the pavement of the street.&#xD;
Upon rising to his feet, Walter found himself in the midst&#xD;
of a milde with Fishall, who was exchanging blows with the&#xD;
crowd, striking full at random, so thick were the enemy upon&#xD;
him. The rest of the crew with uplifted voices were hasten-&#xD;
ing to the rescue.&#xD;
At this critical moment, Old Marl made his appearance, as&#xD;
a mountain of light. He sprang like a leopard in their midst,&#xD;
and unfolding himself in awful majesty, demanded in a voice&#xD;
of thunder, what was the matter. His toweing-energy was&#xD;
magic-like. Intimidated, the enemy slank away, and the crew&#xD;
were soon standing alone.&#xD;
They now again commenced making their way toward the&#xD;
vessel, well enough satisfied with their little adventure. It&#xD;
served, however, to increase their confidence in old Marl.&#xD;
Fishall, a little ashamed of having been the .occasion of&#xD;
&#xD;
A SCUFFLE.                151&#xD;

&#xD;
152              THE FISHER BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
their misfortune, sought all means to turn the conversation to&#xD;
some other topic.&#xD;
" There, boy," drawled out the fisherman, as they were&#xD;
threading a dark, narrow cross street, "do you think you&#xD;
could ever find your way down to the vessel again, if left here&#xD;
alone?"&#xD;
"Aye, that he eould," snapped out Marl, nettled at any dis-&#xD;
paraging allusion to Walter, and being otherwise in no placid&#xD;
humor toward Fishall, for the awkward scrape he had gotten&#xD;
the crew into.&#xD;
For once, the judgment of Marl was appealed from by the&#xD;
simple-minded crew. They very naturally doubted so unrea-&#xD;
sonable a thing, as that the boy could find his way back to the&#xD;
vessel unguided. There was a little ripple of excitement&#xD;
arising from diverse opinion. But Marl, little disposed to&#xD;
brook contradiction, with a recklessness not usual to him, pro-&#xD;
ceeded at once to put the matter to the test. So, after lead-&#xD;
ing them around amid a'perfect maze of windings, he bid the&#xD;
boy in a confident tone take the shortest route to the vessel.&#xD;
Walter was as perfectly lost as if he had awaked up for the&#xD;
first time in the depths of Oregon. But he could no more&#xD;
than go wrong, and he was unwilling to risk the displeasure&#xD;
of the sailor, by any appearance of hesitancy; so striking off&#xD;
with promptitude, sure enough, as if directed by some unseen&#xD;
Mentor, the boy proceeded straight to the vessel, and in the&#xD;
shortest possible time, they were on board. Old Marl him-&#xD;
self could not 1iave come more direct. It was of course the&#xD;
merest chance, but in the eyes of the crew, it elevated the&#xD;
Salt to the dignity of a sage, and Walter to a boy of wonder-&#xD;
ful genius. He was ever afterward looked upon by them, as&#xD;
one destined to some important mission in life. May not the&#xD;
tide of fortune in the career of many a man, have taken its&#xD;
swell at as insignificant beginnings as this ?&#xD;
&#xD;
The next day there came on board a man, and applied for&#xD;
a birth to go with them a trip. His appearance was far from&#xD;
indicating that he knew anything of fishing, or that he could&#xD;
otherwise be of much value on board ; but having room for&#xD;
one more hand, and there being now little time to look&#xD;
around for a choice, the skipper, after consulting some of the&#xD;
crew, shipped him.&#xD;
He was a very young man; in fact, he could not be much&#xD;
above twenty years of age. But his limbs were sadly shrunk&#xD;
up, not from the natural dechy of age, but from the blight, as&#xD;
it would seem, of some moral disease. Along his skinny, ca-&#xD;
daverous hands, ran large, blue veins, swelling as if ready to&#xD;
burst their decaying cerements. His sunken, distorted face,&#xD;
bearing an expression of dreadful blight, looked as if he had&#xD;
been breathing the pestilential sirocco, or that some fierce&#xD;
vulture, was even then at work, devouring silently the vitals&#xD;
of his soul.&#xD;
His dress had a genteel fit, and the cloth appeared of supe-&#xD;
rior quality; but it was most disgustingly soiled, and seemed&#xD;
no inappropriate counterpart of the melancholy body which-&#xD;
they encased, - a fit emblem of a soul of natural grace, be-&#xD;
drenched in the cesspool of woe-begone humanity.&#xD;
Old Marl, with that keenness of mental vision which be-&#xD;
longs to the thoroughly experienced in life, saw at a glance,&#xD;
through the character of their newly shipped hand, but he&#xD;
was too genuinely a bred sailor, to interfere against the&#xD;
authority of the skipper, or to submit advice before being&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
Still, so intense was his antipathy to the new recruit, that&#xD;
he might have been observed continually to dog the fellow&#xD;
about, and with an eye of insufferable scrutiny. As the green&#xD;
hand, in his flimsy way, set to work with the crew on board,&#xD;
the burning, lurid expression of mingled indignation and con-&#xD;

tempt that alternately lighted up the countenance, and then&#xD;
lowered over the brow of the old Salt, like the scathing glin-&#xD;
mering of a surcharged thunder cloud, was in'striking con-&#xD;
trast to his usual large and catholic amiability of feeling.&#xD;
Despite an iron will, which enabled him ordinarily to check&#xD;
his impulses, as with the grip of a vice, the heated caldron of&#xD;
his soul would now and then seethe over in some-hard ejacu-&#xD;
lation, anything but complimentary to the new comer.&#xD;
"Our new hand there isn't altogether to your liking," care-&#xD;
lessly observed Fishall.&#xD;
"Not a whit," responded the Salt.&#xD;
"Well, why ?" demanded Fishall, more to draw out his com-&#xD;
panion, than to express dissent. ~&#xD;
"There'll no good come from having that chap aboard, else&#xD;
toss me into the sea for a false prophet. Do you not see, that&#xD;
his very soul. has been gnawed out of him.. Nothing left, I&#xD;
fancy, but villanous canker sores. He'll be spitting off his&#xD;
rotten notions, after some further acquaintance, you may be&#xD;
sure of."&#xD;
"True, he's rather rickety looking in the joints ; and a big&#xD;
halibut might drag him over the rail; still I can't see what&#xD;
very great harm he'll do aboard."&#xD;
"Nothing is it to have such a maggot thrown into one's&#xD;
peck of dirt? Ah, yes," he added playfully, "he may not&#xD;
be able to damage us old sinners, but then we must keep the&#xD;
boy out of harm's way."&#xD;
This latter allusion ruffled Fishall's sensibilities, and it cut&#xD;
off further conversation.  ,&#xD;
The fitting out finally accomplished, and everything aboard&#xD;
and snugly stowed away, all was now ready for the ensuing&#xD;
cruise. The deck had been neatly cleaned up, and the little,&#xD;
Pink looked as tidy as an expectant country maiden on a&#xD;
Saturday afternoon.&#xD;
&#xD;
CITY COUSINS.                  155&#xD;
Walter had the fortune. of a distant relative in Boston.&#xD;
Mrs. Carl, who possessed deeply the refined sentiment of fain-&#xD;
ily friendship, reminded her son on parting, of the pleasant&#xD;
fact, and putting up his best suit, enjoined on him to be heed-&#xD;
ful in calling upon this kinsman, should circumstances allow&#xD;
of it.&#xD;
As it was yet early in the afternoon, Walter, to whom his&#xD;
mother's every behest had always been as easy as the law of&#xD;
love, attired himself as tastefully as might be, and after get-&#xD;
ting what directions seemed fit, set out for the house, yet not&#xD;
without a feeling of excessive timidity.&#xD;
By persistent inquiry, he found the house, and was re-&#xD;
ceived by his friends with expressions of agreeable surprise.&#xD;
Indeed, these city cousins literally showered the boy with af-&#xD;
fhble attentions, and on his taking leave, bestowed their best&#xD;
wishes for his success. with -the- cordial solicitation that he&#xD;
would not fail to write to them, whenever convenient.&#xD;
le had now only to return to the vessel. But in doing&#xD;
this, his good genii, that had so graciously guided him the&#xD;
evening before, seemed now to have forsaken him. With the&#xD;
illusory confidence'of youth, he resolved upon getting back to&#xD;
the Pink without for once inquiring. So striking off in what&#xD;
seemed the right direction, lie pursued his way with quick and&#xD;
confident step.&#xD;
On and on he wended, but objects grew more and more&#xD;
strange in appearance, until out he bolted upon a long bridge.&#xD;
Nothing disheartened, around he wheeled, and set off in&#xD;
another direction, but after much walking, he found himself&#xD;
again at a bridge, in another quarter of the city. He was&#xD;
now enough humiliated, to deign inquiring his way. What&#xD;
was his surprise on being told that Lewis's Wharf, where the&#xD;
Pink lay, was away off at the opposite side of the city.&#xD;
Once more -he set out in the direction given him, but his&#xD;

THE FISHER BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
A NEW SCENE.&#xD;
&#xD;
treacherous little brain proved again at. fault, and round and&#xD;
round he roamed, until, he found himself in a perfect maze of&#xD;
bewilderment.&#xD;
The shades of night began to fall, and a darkness as palpa-&#xD;
ble was fast gathering around his, spirits ; when while thread-&#xD;
ing a new street, whom should he bolt upon but Winthread,&#xD;
their new hand. Hardly anything could have brought him a&#xD;
more vivid glow of delight. The very being whom the day&#xD;
before he had loathed, now burst upon his joyful gaze, in&#xD;
grateful welcome.&#xD;
Such is the force of adversity, to change the eye lens of&#xD;
feeling ! With the confiding air of youth, the 'boy seized&#xD;
eagerly the hand of Winthread, and pressed it affectionately,&#xD;
begging at the same time to be shown the way to the Pink.&#xD;
The man with a bitter smile assented, but muttered in a&#xD;
hollow voice, that seemed to come from the caverns of ruin,&#xD;
that lie must first call at a house near by.&#xD;
Walter suspecting no evil, followed on,. although the&#xD;
-strange air of Winthread gave the boy a slight sense of un-&#xD;
easiness.&#xD;
Winthread led the way until they came- to what appeared&#xD;
an unfrequcueted street, with houses of a somewhat pretentious&#xD;
.style, but rather dilapidated in appearance. To one of these&#xD;
they at length approached a deep doorway,,in which stood&#xD;
leaning against a pillar, a female, whose slight form was par-&#xD;
tially revealed by a pale light that flickered from a lantern,&#xD;
suspended from the ceiling of the archway over the door-&#xD;
steps. She greeted Winthread as lie came up, with a few&#xD;
sentences, coarse, familiar, and jocose ; and then bandying an&#xD;
epithet or two of double meaning, wafted him with her white&#xD;
plump hand into the house. Her demeanor toward Walter&#xD;
was softened to greater feminine propriety, still it failed to&#xD;
inspire him with that divine emotion, which the mere pres-&#xD;
&#xD;
ence of women, rarely fails to awaken in the breast of guile-&#xD;
less youth.&#xD;
On entering, Walter lost sight of Winthread, and saw him&#xD;
not again in the house. But another young female of win-&#xD;
ning address appeared before the boy, and after leading&#xD;
blithely the way through a dimly lighted hall, up a crooked&#xD;
stairway, ushered him into a spacious saloon. It was very&#xD;
brilliantly lighted, and although a practised eye might have&#xD;
recognized a soiled carpet, defaced and ill-assorted furniture,&#xD;
yet to the rustic gaze of Walter, the effect was dazzling. A&#xD;
bevy of females were in the room, varying from sixteen or so,&#xD;
to an age unmentionable. There were some among them&#xD;
)ossessing features of fine mould, but with all there was a&#xD;
lack more or less striking of that sweet spiritual purity which&#xD;
is the fragrance of the female face.  lheir dress flauntingly&#xD;
bedecked, seemed but the bawdy colors of a prurient Fancy.&#xD;
Soihe were lounging in voluptuous posture, upon chairs, sofas,&#xD;
or ottomans, some leaning mechanically against rose-wood&#xD;
tables or marble mantels, looking with vacant stare at some&#xD;
trivial object, while others in a defiant ease of air, were saun-&#xD;
tering up and down the room. Walter tremblingly took a&#xD;
seat. No one accosted him, and he remained a brief space, a&#xD;
silent, though not inattentive spectator. His entrance served&#xD;
to give a flush of movement to the throng, but it was rather&#xD;
the temporary acceleration of a waning pulse, than the strong&#xD;
glow of Nature.&#xD;
Presently two females sprang to their feet, and commenced&#xD;
a striding promenade around the room; two others struck up&#xD;
a pert, gossiping chat; and all in one way or another, essayed&#xD;
to attract attention, and display coquettishly their persons.&#xD;
Now, one sprang to the piano forte, and commenced running&#xD;
her fingers over the keys in a kind of mock agility, another&#xD;
rushed to her side, and cane out with a saucy ditty, while the&#xD;

&#xD;
EMBARRASSING PREDICAMENT.       159&#xD;
&#xD;
former thummed in a laughable accompaniment. This over,&#xD;
the entire company circled in a general promenade. A fast&#xD;
miss now got possession of the instrument, and drummed out&#xD;
a thread-bare tune, throwing in occasional flourishes, by way&#xD;
of episode. The rest paired off for a cotillon, a requisite&#xD;
number assuming the part of gentlemen gallants ; and it must&#xD;
be confessed that these performed their parts, if not with&#xD;
grace, at least with adroitness. The cotillon over, they all&#xD;
subsided into seats, and broke out into a merry bandying col-&#xD;
oquy, accompanied by awry postures, and double entendre&#xD;
expressions.&#xD;
All this time, Walter looked on in dumb confusion. Where&#xD;
was he ? What could be the meaning of what he saw? He could&#xD;
not penetrate the cloud of a mystery that hung around him,&#xD;
yet the voice of Nature whispered "that all is not right."  A&#xD;
moral disquietude possessed him. Sentiment became shocked.&#xD;
Feeling turned into disgust. And even Sense turned aside in&#xD;
loathing. With the fires of youth ~glowing in .his soul and&#xD;
keenly susceptible to the power of female charms, all their&#xD;
low arts, their gross display,.,awoke no agreeable emotion&#xD;
within him. On the contrary, a painful sense of some great,&#xD;
moral derangement, like the unhinging of harmonious nature,&#xD;
oppressed him, and his soul turned away in disgust. Thus it&#xD;
ever is when purity first encounters debasement.&#xD;
He could not penetrate the maze of his situation; could&#xD;
not look through the entanglement of his own feelings, but as&#xD;
his reason contemplated the shreds of humanity before him,&#xD;
an intuitive fim'ger pointed them but the blackened ruins of&#xD;
Nature's Masterpiece. The fire of destruction had swept&#xD;
athwart the ocean of their soul, and had left but charred skele-&#xD;
tons of former loveliness.&#xD;
When the sun of moral beauty in the human soul has once&#xD;
set, how appalling the darkness ! And if that human soul be&#xD;
&#xD;
woman, angelic woman, how dreadful the blackness ! How&#xD;
mournful that celestial beauty can ever be changed to'a thing&#xD;
the most odious ! and the brighter in glory, the darker in per-&#xD;
version. So woman in her native purity, the highest in the&#xD;
heaven of moral beauty, when she falls, sinks to the lowest&#xD;
hell of degradation.&#xD;
In the race of the good, for reaching a higher spiritual mil-&#xD;
lennium upon earth, what a hindering load is not that loveliest&#xD;
attribute of the female character, changed into a hideous mon-&#xD;
ster, and hanging upon the skirts of humanity with clinched&#xD;
pertinacity!&#xD;
Finding thus far their arts availless in beguiling the feel-&#xD;
ings of the boy, they approached each in turn to secure a per-&#xD;
sonal conquest. But their stale efforts only embarrassed the&#xD;
boy's mind. le could not be touched by beings so destitute&#xD;
of points of sympathy.&#xD;
While thus a prey to a species of tormenting disquietude,&#xD;
there suddenly darted through a doorway opposite, a youthful&#xD;
figure. She was of a light and graceful form, and most ex-&#xD;
quisitely attired. Approaching Walter gracefully, she gently&#xD;
laid her hand upon his arm, accosting him-in tones so tender&#xD;
and moving, that he was instantly enthralled by the spell of&#xD;
her presence. In confidential, almost pleading accents, she&#xD;
begged that he would follow her to another room, where she&#xD;
would entrust him with her secret.&#xD;
For a moment he hesitated, under a mingled feeling of&#xD;
timidity and suspicion. But glad to be relieved from his&#xD;
present awkward predicament, and beguiled it may be, by the&#xD;
seductive charm of the fair unknown, he summoned resolution&#xD;
and followed on.&#xD;
She led the way into a small, but elegantly furnished cham-&#xD;
ber, and after closing the door, and handing him a chair&#xD;
seated herself by his side.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC8107-00000082"/>&#xD;
A. STREET ENCOUNTER.           161&#xD;
&#xD;
Her small delicate frame had a fairy grace. 1Her pure&#xD;
classic features breathed the soul of refinement. Instinct with&#xD;
tenderness seemed her speaking blue eyes. Golden tresses&#xD;
fell profusely adown her swan-like neck, and rested upon a&#xD;
bust as white as the lily. A gauze mantle of silvery lue&#xD;
flowed gracefully from her handsomely turned shoulders, re-&#xD;
vealing a bust of exquisite symmetry, and an arm and hand&#xD;
of voluptuous mould. From under her pendent skirt peeped&#xD;
a dainty foot. A single brilliant pinned her scarf, and an-&#xD;
other rayed from the velvet band that bound her forehead.&#xD;
Walter could not but be captivated in the presence of such&#xD;
fascinating beauty, and when he felt her warm breath redo-&#xD;
lent with passion upon his cheek, witnessed her soft bosom&#xD;
palpitate with wild emotion, looked into the countenance of&#xD;
the girl lit-up with intense radiance, a paroxysm of emotion&#xD;
swept over him.&#xD;
Taking his hand in hers, and bending close down to him,&#xD;
"Listen," said the fair stranger. "I am an orphan. My&#xD;
guardian thwarted my will, and I fled his roof. The young&#xD;
man in whom I confided, betrayed my confidence. I was en-&#xD;
trapped and led to this house, by an agency unknown to me.&#xD;
I have now no more to hope for from society. Yet I feel an&#xD;
unconquerable craving for companionship, for sympathy, for&#xD;
love. There is here for me no congeniality. I would fly this&#xD;
place. Take me hence. Be my protector. Lead me whither&#xD;
you will, and take my all, fortune, heart, destiny. Oh do not&#xD;
hesitate. Think me not polluted. I am pure, at least in heart,&#xD;
Heaven knows.&#xD;
And as the eye of the excited girl, melting with beseeching&#xD;
tenderness, fell upon his, the electric glance with her appeal-&#xD;
ing words, aroused all the heroic and generous in his nature.&#xD;
Springing upon his feet, under the impulse of enthusiasm, lie&#xD;
felt as if he could join his destiny with hers, and flee with the&#xD;
&#xD;
fair girl whither she listed. Almost delirious with emotion, he&#xD;
sauntered, unconscious of his movements, towards the window,&#xD;
but his eye turning out doorward, what did it first fall upon, but&#xD;
the same form that lie saw last at his grandfather's, and which&#xD;
had haunted, at times, his imagination ever since ! It stood&#xD;
motionless in an angle of the court, partially enveloped in the&#xD;
gray folds of twilight. He was struck petrified; but this new&#xD;
vision dissolved as with a magic touch, the illusive emotion&#xD;
excited by the fair girl near him. And in its stead, there&#xD;
arose before his distracted vision, the image of his dear&#xD;
mother, in calm, admonitive air; and her closing impressive&#xD;
words seemed to issue from her lips, and fall in healing ac-&#xD;
cents upon his troubled soul. " Beware of false appearances.&#xD;
Be true to yourself, to your mother, your God."  The fetters&#xD;
of his soul were instantly broken. A new perception dawned&#xD;
upon him. A wise resolution sprang up in his breast. Bow-&#xD;
ing to the lady, he left the room, descended the stairway, and&#xD;
was in a moment upon the pavement. The figure that he&#xD;
expected to encounter was nowhere to be seen, but as he felt&#xD;
the air of heaven, a mountain load seemed lifted from his&#xD;
bosom.&#xD;
Proceeding on, his eye caught the figure of a stalwart man&#xD;
making rapid strides towards him. As the approaching per-&#xD;
son passed a street lamp, a gleam of light therefrom shot upon&#xD;
his face, and revealed the well known features of Old Marl.&#xD;
With a bound of joy, the boy sprang to the side of the faithful&#xD;
sailor, but how confounded was he to find his welcome friend&#xD;
barely to notice him. He seemed, on the contrary, engrossed&#xD;
with some object behind the boy. Turning around, Walter&#xD;
perceived Winthread coming up.&#xD;
"Aye, this is your game," roared out the Old Salt, a dark&#xD;
cloud lowering over his jagged features. "Well, I fancied as&#xD;
much. You'd fetch down the boy into your own muddy&#xD;

&#xD;
slough, eh ? I say," he bellowed, raising his voice to thunder&#xD;
tones. "The knot of the hangman under your left ear would&#xD;
be none to good for you, and I've more than half a mind to&#xD;
give you a stroke of introduction to the place.&#xD;
Stung with these .words, Winthread sprang forward and&#xD;
struck the sailor a passionate blow in the face. Aroused to&#xD;
the quick, the latter squared off, and dealt his combatant such&#xD;
a blow as. to fell the other flat upon the pavement. The&#xD;
stroke was a fearful one, and Winthread lay prostrate and&#xD;
bleeding profusely. The belligerent thus summarily van-&#xD;
quished, the current of the sailor's passion, as if suddenly&#xD;
checked, was overflowing him with remorse. Old Marl was&#xD;
first at the side of the wounded man. Raising his head in his&#xD;
arms, with the tenderness of a woman, he endeavored to assuage&#xD;
his hurt.&#xD;
The crowd soon began gathering, but not knowing who had&#xD;
given the blow, they could but little more than express sym-&#xD;
pathy with the suffering man, and breathe imprecations&#xD;
against the inhuman author, as it seemed,, of the atrocious&#xD;
mischief.&#xD;
Presently, a watchman was seen pressing through the&#xD;
crowd, witIr an earnest, authoritative air. With the aid of&#xD;
Marl, he hurried off the bleeding man to a neighboring&#xD;
apothecary's; where cordials were administered, and his&#xD;
bruises assuaged.&#xD;
All this time, the attentions of Marl were those of a de-&#xD;
voted wife. He seemed absolutely to forget himself in fervid&#xD;
sympathy with the suffering man. He would not leave him,&#xD;
until self-possession was regained, and then slipping his purse&#xD;
into the hands of the watchman, he took of Winthread an af-&#xD;
fectionate leave.&#xD;
During the whole scene, there was not a word or sign of&#xD;
upbraiding on the part of Winthread, towards his malefactor.&#xD;
&#xD;
The conviction of having richly deserved his fate, and espe-&#xD;
cially the overflowing goodness of the veteran sailor quite dis..&#xD;
armed him of a feeling for reproach.&#xD;
If men for the most part come to hate those whom they&#xD;
have injured, there are natures so thoroughly honest, a5 to&#xD;
crave the necessity, of making reparation for what they may&#xD;
Have destroyed.&#xD;
On their way to the vessel, Old Marl preserved a dogged&#xD;
silence. This dark, moody air, hung like a cloud of terror&#xD;
over the boy. He felt conscious of having been the occasion&#xD;
of it; and his feelings were not unlike those of the young&#xD;
wife who feels for the first time the frown of the man, in&#xD;
whom her all is staked for life.&#xD;

CHAPTER X.&#xD;
" Though at times my spirit fails me,&#xD;
And the bitter tear-drops fall,&#xD;
Though my lot is hard and lonely,&#xD;
Yet I hope -I hope through all."&#xD;
THE morning dawned with a light wind creeping rippingl&#xD;
adown the stream. The crew responded with alacrity to the&#xD;
call of all hands; and in ajy, to use the quaint style of&#xD;
Fishall, the mindful little Pink with sails hanging like the&#xD;
trowsers of a country lad, just decorated for a rural party,&#xD;
was noiselessly gliding out of the harbor.&#xD;
None more glad to be rid of the glare and dust of the big&#xD;
city, than the fisherman. Its eddying current of intense arti-&#xD;
ficial life bewilders, and its smoky, choking heavens, suffocates&#xD;
his simple nature. Well may he hail a return to the expanse&#xD;
and freedom of ocean with feelings of fresh buoyancy.&#xD;
Lolling upon the deck, or reclining upon hatch-way, kid,&#xD;
or railing, each one carelessly lay, contemplating with tran-&#xD;
quil delight, the animated scene unrolling around them. The&#xD;
resounding city with its forests of masts, its glittering spires,&#xD;
and mountain dome, were giddily receding in the distance.&#xD;
Off to the left, lay several huge naval hulks, sluggishly moored&#xD;
upon the flat waters, like so many surly chained mastiffs,&#xD;
awaiting some dire opportunity. Here and there an eleva-&#xD;
tion was decked by some more pretentious edifice, serving as&#xD;
a land-mark to the inquiring eye. Before them rose a gal-,&#xD;
axy of islands, parking a beautiful labyrinth with the waters,&#xD;
(164)-&#xD;
&#xD;
ENCOUNTER WITH A MAN-OF-WAR.             165&#xD;
all mantling in the deepest flush of May. Over all were&#xD;
showering the golden, rays of the rising sun, which with the&#xD;
graceful sinuosities cf the harbor, and the illusory movement&#xD;
of the different objects upon the shore, filled the mind of the&#xD;
beholder with the most agreeable charm imaginable.&#xD;
"Nicks's Mate. Do you know boy what that means? Eh?&#xD;
No? Well, 'tis the place where a bloody fellow by the name&#xD;
of Nicks, hung his mate," quoth Loggy, turning towards Wal-&#xD;
ter with a quizzing look.&#xD;
"Any more of the same sort," muttered Marl, sarcasti-&#xD;
cally.&#xD;
"Not exactly, but I know of a good one though, that hap-&#xD;
pened about here,' replied the fisherman.&#xD;
" Then let's have it," returned the sailor.&#xD;
" Well, 'twas about Dick Carthwright, or Dick, as he was&#xD;
simply called. He was a hard customer, and cut up many a&#xD;
wild trick with the English. And if I were to tell all the&#xD;
stories I've heard about him, 'twould fill a book."&#xD;
" No matter about the introduction," shouted a half-a-dozen&#xD;
voices, "let's have the story."&#xD;
" Well, you must know," continued Loggy, " that Dick en-&#xD;
gaged for a living, in whatever turned up best. It made little&#xD;
difference to him, so long as things went to his mind, but&#xD;
when they didn't, he was off; like an unbroke colt.&#xD;
" Well, once in the time of the old war, he found himself&#xD;
aboard a wee Pink-stern a fishing. They were at this time&#xD;
off Cape Cod. It was foggy, and thick, too, as mud. The&#xD;
crew were idly at the rail, and they were just talking over&#xD;
the chances of the war, when halloa, there broke out hard&#xD;
upon them, a British ship of war. She showed a double row&#xD;
of teeth, and the men aboard were sas thick as pismires upon&#xD;
a sand-hill. To tell the truth, he was a saucy looking chap,&#xD;
and every man's hair stood right on eend. But when he ran&#xD;

up the English ensign, and fired a gun, the ball of which&#xD;
went whizzing over their heads, and rattling through the rig.&#xD;
ging, like a scared partridge, their skin fairly crawled on1&#xD;
their flesh.&#xD;
"The enemy sent a boat aboard, and offered to let them go&#xD;
free, if one of the crew would pilot them into Boston Harbor.&#xD;
At this, all were struck dumi? with fear. Boston, a little&#xD;
while before, had been in the hands of the British, but now&#xD;
the Americans had again gotten possession. If the truth&#xD;
should be let out, more than likely they would be seized, their&#xD;
vessel scuttled, and they themselves sent to Dartmoor Prison.&#xD;
On the other hand, whichever .should stand pilot, would be&#xD;
pretty sure to get strung up to the yard arm for his pains,&#xD;
when it should really come out which party held Boston.&#xD;
"But Dick didn't know what it was to be afraid. To find&#xD;
himself in some strange scrape, and then by some hocus&#xD;
pocus, work himself out, was just what he most liked. So he&#xD;
stepped forward and volunteered. The British boat now re-&#xD;
turned, and the ship squared away for Boston Harbor.&#xD;
"Dick was a droll fellow, and as soon as he got aboard, be-&#xD;
gan pacing the quarter-deck with a look of as much self-con-&#xD;
sequence; as if he had been the commodore himself. The&#xD;
commander of course didn't like this any too well, but Dick&#xD;
told him broadly, that Dick Carthwright happened to be cap-&#xD;
tain of that ship. Pretty soon the commander gave off some&#xD;
general order, when Dick stepped up to him, and told him&#xD;
plainly, that if another order was given off without his con-&#xD;
sent, he would run them straight upon the first rock they&#xD;
should come up with. This threw the Englishman into a&#xD;
dreadful rage, and he drew his sword. But Dick was not so&#xD;
easily frightened. He ran off a string of 'such awful oaths, as&#xD;
made the Englishman, even, tremble. Then throwing off his&#xD;
boots and pea-jacket, with a ripping oath he swore he would&#xD;
&#xD;
jump overboard and swim ashore, if he couldn't have entire&#xD;
Command of the ship. This did the cure. The commander&#xD;
faneying he'd got some Yankee water-witch aboard, and&#xD;
thinking it best not to lose his pilot, gave in.&#xD;
"All went smoothly afterward, Dick walked side by side&#xD;
with the commander, spinning him long yarns about America&#xD;
and the Revolution. Of course he took care to tickle the&#xD;
Englishman's vanity, and in a little while they were as famil-&#xD;
iar as old cronies.&#xD;
"The fog now broke away, and tl e ship was fast coming&#xD;
up with the islands. Dick hit upon taking her in by a chan-&#xD;
nel that would not let the Englishman see the American&#xD;
colors upon the fort, until it was too late. He was careful to&#xD;
keep the ship chock upon the leeward side of the channel.&#xD;
"Presently they caught the sight of the American flag&#xD;
floating over the fort. The captain saw it first, and he was&#xD;
like a wild man."&#xD;
"American colors," he screamed. " Then they've retaken&#xD;
Boston. What shall we do ?"   All the time looking half&#xD;
crazy.&#xD;
" So they have," shouted Dick, appearing greatly aston-&#xD;
ished. "Then we must back out of this in double quick&#xD;
time."&#xD;
" heave about ?" inquired the captain.&#xD;
"No, not water enough," bawled Dick, "must wear ship.&#xD;
Man your weather-braces, hard starboard your helm," shouted&#xD;
Dick. The captain roared out the command after him.&#xD;
All was alive. The big ship slowly turned upon her heel,&#xD;
but by the time she had got fairly before the wind, stram&#xD;
she struck upon the bottom. The captain was struck speech-&#xD;
less.&#xD;
They began at once to fire from the fort, and a barge was&#xD;
seen approaching.&#xD;

"What can I do ?" said the captain.&#xD;
D ? give me your sword and papers, and go below, and&#xD;
I'll take care of your ship," replied Dick.&#xD;
The captain at length yielded. The barge soon came up.&#xD;
Who commands that ship ?" roared out the officer.&#xD;
"I do," shouted Dick.&#xD;
"Who is I?" bawled the officer.&#xD;
"Dick Carthwright."&#xD;
"Then, Captain   Dick  Carthwright, haul down your&#xD;
colors."&#xD;
This was a capital oversight in Dick. If he had at first&#xD;
doused the English flag, and run up the American instead, he&#xD;
could have held the vessel. Still, he stuck to it, that the ves-&#xD;
sel belonged to him. The government offered to allow him a&#xD;
part of the prize, and no small one was it either,-a trans)ort&#xD;
ship, loaded with all sorts of supplies for their army. But no,&#xD;
Dick would have the whole or none. And he lost the whole.;&#xD;
for what's the use battling with Uncle Sam."&#xD;
"A bran new story that," muttered Marl. "Never heard it&#xD;
before, nor read it, not even in Barber's Historical Collection&#xD;
of Massachusetts."&#xD;
"But 'tis true, every word of it," replied the fisherman, a&#xD;
little warmed up, by the allusion of Marl. "I've heard the&#xD;
old folks tell it a hundred times; besides a great many others&#xD;
just as good, about our forefathers, and the pranks they cut&#xD;
up with the British. But they don't always get the best&#xD;
things into books."&#xD;
"True, true, you're more than half right there," replied&#xD;
Marl. "Your book writers are more than half the time a&#xD;
flimsy pack, but green hands after all aboard the ship of life.&#xD;
The real sailors, the men that have had a touch of expe-&#xD;
rience, have passed through the needle's eye of trial, are a&#xD;

the schools, set themselves up as our high priests.. But their&#xD;
manufactures are more- likely than not, wish-a-washy stuff,&#xD;
either the rehashed notions of others, or the flimsy vagaries&#xD;
of their own feeble fancies. But 'tis little bowing of the knee&#xD;
that these liveried preachers get from me. Their dainty sen-&#xD;
tences are too much like the glove-tipped fingers of an empty&#xD;
pated fop. Give me the hearty grasp of a full soul, that has&#xD;
a ring to it that sends a tingle to your fingers' ends."&#xD;
"Why don't you write a book, Mr. Marlboro ?" exclaimed&#xD;
Walter, his face brightening up, under the double blaze of&#xD;
timidity and a generous suggestion. " Surely you've seen&#xD;
enough of the world,.and we all know how well you can paint&#xD;
lip thi--s."&#xD;
But the boy felt this to be a wide latitude of familiarity, he&#xD;
was taking with the sailor, for whom he still had a feeling of&#xD;
awe, and lie turned hesitatingly toward the furrowed face of&#xD;
Marl, to divine how this boldness would be received.&#xD;
At this unexpected compliment, the susceptible sailor drew&#xD;
up is body like a basking alligator on feeling the warm sun,&#xD;
shifted his quid of tobacco-to the other cheek, threw a serio-&#xD;
comic glance at the boy, while a merry twinkle danced in his&#xD;
eve.&#xD;
" I write a book - I? Why not bid a Polar bear dance&#xD;
a hornpipe."  Then resuming a thoughtful gravity, his coun-&#xD;
tenance, after passing through several hues of emotion, finally&#xD;
blazed up with a radiance that betokened the consciousness of&#xD;
a divinity within; that the feeling of.capability had perched&#xD;
upon the sunlit peak of his soul.&#xD;
" Ah, my boy, this writing a book, is, I fancy, something&#xD;

GEORGE'S BANK.&#xD;
&#xD;
like a voyage of discovery -sure to turn out in the end, a&#xD;
long voyage, and a hard one. First, comes the tedious ap-&#xD;
prenticeship to get the trick of composition, as I have said.&#xD;
Meanwhile, every nook of the universe must be visited for&#xD;
images, else your style will prove as barren as a Scotch&#xD;
heath. Then comes the everlasting labor of composition, in&#xD;
which you must stick close to the line of thought, no matter&#xD;
how many bright scenes tempt you aside ; and keep forever&#xD;
pushing on, no matter how bitterly jaded nature cries stop&#xD;
and refresh yourself.&#xD;
Nor is this all. The prodigious travail of composition over,&#xD;
a publisher is to be found. One could no more hope to get&#xD;
along ,without this fore-topsail agency, than a green captain&#xD;
might expect to without an owner. Now, this hitch in the&#xD;
becket is not so easy to be taken; for the small fry of pub-&#xD;
lishers would be of puny force in helping to launch your&#xD;
newly freighted craft upon the tide of success; and as for the&#xD;
larger and better-fed gentry of the tribe, they are rather&#xD;
chary how they nibble at a new bait. But if one of these&#xD;
latter should condescend to take you under the glossy folds of&#xD;
his wings, and then vague fortune should fall into the humor&#xD;
of sounding you a blast from her conch, these gents are none&#xD;
too dainty to carve for themselves the lion's share, and leave&#xD;
you the bones for picking.&#xD;
"Well, a publisher hitched to your interest, the next is the&#xD;
dread of running the. gauntlet of the press. Nor is this a&#xD;
slight affair either. For although these gentlemen of the&#xD;
quill are now-a-days tolerably civil, yet now and then one&#xD;
does not hesitate to give a cut of the lash, if only for the fun&#xD;
of it, or to try his knack at swinging the whip.&#xD;
"At last comes the dear good public itself. And with them&#xD;
it is very much, a matter of whim. You can no more tell how&#xD;
the popular gale is going to blow, than you can foretell the&#xD;
&#xD;
weather in the Gulf-Stream. Some very good books have&#xD;
fallen dead-born from the press, while many an indifferent&#xD;
volume has had the good luck to fire ablaze the four quarters&#xD;
of the world. But where one volume wins its way to fame,&#xD;
there are ten that moulder in the vaults of the publisher's&#xD;
warehouse. So you see, my lad, 'tis a long, rough, uncertain&#xD;
and weary road, from the setting out, when you first dip pen&#xD;
into inkstand, and the reaching of the goal, when you can put&#xD;
the cash into your pocket."&#xD;
" But it must be so glorious," mused the boy, " to find one's&#xD;
self all of a sudden famous ; to feel that one is being read&#xD;
by the world, that his admirers are counted by the thousands,&#xD;
that he is all at once greatly multiplied."&#xD;
" True," responded Marl, " but 'tis very much a lottery ;&#xD;
and the chances are greatly against you ; and if 'tis a blank&#xD;
you draw, after so much toil, how miserable is the feeling!"&#xD;
The cook here shouted out, "Sate, ye," a sound that cut&#xD;
short further argument.&#xD;
The Pink continued ploughing her way under a brisk south-&#xD;
west breeze, until they struck soundings on George's Bank.&#xD;
Here they made a trial for two or three days, sometimes&#xD;
fishing at anchor, at others adrift, hove to.&#xD;
But Walter's experience while on this bank, was enlivened&#xD;
by hardly a single ray of happy impression. The soundings&#xD;
were deeper and the fishes larger, than on the shoals, which&#xD;
added greatly to the labor and fatigue of hauling the line.&#xD;
Then the tide set wildly (it being spring-tide), and, rigmarole-&#xD;
like, was ever changing its course, sweeping often quite around&#xD;
the compass in the space of twenty-four hours. This caused&#xD;
the lines so to stray as to take 150 or 180 fathoms to reach&#xD;
bottom. Now; when some lordly fish, or more yet, a mon-&#xD;
arch-halibut seized the hook, if he did not snap the line at&#xD;
once, and march summarily off with the rest of the craft, it&#xD;

172              THE FISHER BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
would take several hands and a tedious while to worry his&#xD;
majesty to the surface, when he would break water a long&#xD;
way astern, floundering hitherward reluctantly, reminding&#xD;
Walter of the deceptive antics of a bird of his native, hills,&#xD;
called the killdee, when in fear of losing its eggs or young.&#xD;
This incessant sweep of the rapid current upon the watery&#xD;
waste, awakened a strange feeling of insecurity in the breast&#xD;
of the Fisher Boy, and quite destroyed the sublimity of his&#xD;
emotions.&#xD;
One day, while standing along by the wind, under a stiff&#xD;
breeze, they suddenly shallowed their water, to twenty, fif-&#xD;
teen, ten fathoms.&#xD;
"Breakers!" exclaimed Fishall.&#xD;
"Ah, sure enough," joined Loggy, fumbling forward, and&#xD;
straining his eyes to get a clearer view.,&#xD;
All started up, and in a moment were staring in amaze-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
There they were, long surges of breaking waves, on the&#xD;
weather bow, in reality. Breakers ! out of sight of land, in&#xD;
mid ocean as it were, with nothing else around, far and near,&#xD;
but an illimitable watery waste ! How desolate, how fearful&#xD;
the sentiment it awakened !&#xD;
"They must be the shoal water of George's," at lengitb&#xD;
mused Loggy. " Well," he added, "I've'heard tell a great deal&#xD;
about this shoal water, but in all my fishing about here, I&#xD;
never saw them before. In fact, I doubted if there were any.&#xD;
But there's no mistake, there they are, and saucy looking&#xD;
fellows'are theytoo."&#xD;
Although the breakers were well up to windward, yet the&#xD;
current it appeared was sweeping the vessel with so fearful a&#xD;
rapidity toward them, that the skipper was obliged to put the&#xD;
Pink before the wind, and then she escaped only by the favor&#xD;
of a brisk breeze.&#xD;
&#xD;
As they distanced the danger, Marl, in solemn tones, nar-&#xD;
rated to the crew the fearful stories of these shoals, that con-&#xD;
tinued to haunt the imagination of seamen. In the line of ves-&#xD;
sels from Europe and from the East Indies, how many a-noble&#xD;
ship with all her costly treasure of freight, and her richer&#xD;
treasure of human life, may not here have found a watery&#xD;
grave, -their skeleton forms tossed endlessly to and fro with&#xD;
the shifting sand and ceaseless billow -no inapt emblem of&#xD;
the turmoil of human life -until the judgment trump shall&#xD;
summon all to appear before the bar of the righteous Judge !&#xD;
The swift tides, the blustering weather, and especially the&#xD;
scarcity of fishes on George's, induced them to try their luck&#xD;
elsewhere ; so squaring away, they put the Pink's bow for&#xD;
Brown's bank.&#xD;
On the way, they sounded every now and then, with hooks&#xD;
well baited for a trial ; but no signs appeared of fishes, except&#xD;
here and there, a veritable green-nose cod, which they hauled&#xD;
up, looking an indefatigable worker after muscles.&#xD;
Coming to what they thought the best ground, they made a&#xD;
searching ti al, but evidently what they sought was not there.&#xD;
The wind had fallen off to a calm, the ocean become a&#xD;
metalic mirror, and the shades of evening began to gather&#xD;
around. The crew were lounging promiscuously about the&#xD;
vessel, some ensconced in the cabin, others upon deck pen-&#xD;
sively contemplating the sad beauties of departing day.&#xD;
Loggy alone was at the rail, pertinaciously bobbing for squid.&#xD;
At length, some one feeling a little merry, tossed the old&#xD;
fisherman a pun; others, one after another, followed suit.&#xD;
The example proved contagious, and a lively scene followed.&#xD;
It seemed the aim to cover the veteran fisherman with a&#xD;
laugh, or perchance dislodge him from the berth he held so&#xD;
resolutely ; but at their squibs he only chewed more vehe-&#xD;
mently his quid of tobacco; squirted the juice more cop?-&#xD;

CATCHING SQUID.             175&#xD;
&#xD;
174             THE FISHER BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
ously, meanwhile, now and then casting at them a look&#xD;
askance, as much as to say, " Ah, my boys, I'm 'too old a&#xD;
stager to have my head turned by the jokes of youth."&#xD;
But in a little while the tables were most effectually turned.&#xD;
"«Squid, 0!" ejaculated Loggy, at the same time jerking one&#xD;
over the rail by way of corroboration. " Squid, 0!" was re-&#xD;
peated from mouth to mouth through the vessel. The sound&#xD;
ran like wild-fire. If she had just struck upon a-rock, the&#xD;
excitement could not have been more ardent. Intense bustle&#xD;
and tumult prevails. Each dives into some nook for his box,&#xD;
ransacks it for his craft, when one after another come tumbling&#xD;
and leaping along, without hat or boots it may be, but burning&#xD;
for a hand in the catch. In a moment all are glued to the rail,&#xD;
and 'tis sport indeed.&#xD;
The squid, or cuttle-fsh, is a peculiar species, His head is&#xD;
terminated by long feelers, and for weapon of defence, he&#xD;
secretes a bottle of inky liquid by means of which, when pur-&#xD;
sued, he blackens the waters around, and then darts backward,&#xD;
this easily eluding his enemy.&#xD;
He appears of a quiet, inoffensive disposition, but proves to&#xD;
have a. most voracious appetite ; and when the fisherman's&#xD;
gig - consisting of a cilindrical piece of composition of 4ead&#xD;
and pewter, polished bright, attached by the upper end to a&#xD;
line, and at the lower, having pins carefully lashed around it,&#xD;
reversed as hooks -is bobbing up and down, nitaking it&#xD;
doubtless for a nice, shining fish of prey, he seizes it vora-&#xD;
ciously, and is drawn on board by willing hands.&#xD;
The squid is deemed most capital bait. As many as twenty&#xD;
fishes, it is said, have been exchanged for a single one, by&#xD;
some shrewd old fisherman, used to tip the points of the hooks&#xD;
after stringing on the other bait. Hence, no possible event is&#xD;
so calculated to awaken from their habitual lethargy a fishing&#xD;
crew, and precipitate one and all headlong toward the rail, as&#xD;
&#xD;
if the very furies were in possession of them, as the cry of&#xD;
Squid, 0."  Then this unique fish, like an earnest nature,&#xD;
seizes the hook quietly, but with a will; and what adds fun to&#xD;
catching them is, that they are wont to eject their ink bolt into&#xD;
the face of their captors, just as he is taking them over the rail.&#xD;
The catch was a liberal one ; and under the glow of anima-&#xD;
tion the exercise begat, together with the buoyant prospect of&#xD;
a good day's work on the morrow, all were in the liveliest&#xD;
mood imaginable. The decks were cleared up with a will;&#xD;
supper was despatched with a double zest. Meanwhile, Loggy&#xD;
had cleaned a fine squid, and flayed him on the coals for a&#xD;
rasher; and all agreed that he well deserved the dainty&#xD;
morsel.&#xD;
The plentifulness of squid led them to believe that there&#xD;
must be herring around ; so they let down carefully their set&#xD;
net into the sea, veered it a short distance astern, and then&#xD;
hitched the seine to the vessel by a rope.&#xD;
It remained calm, the surface of the sea was smooth, and&#xD;
the miriad stars, in the soft canopy above, looked sublimely&#xD;
down. The gentle liquid flaps of the fishes,,as one after&#xD;
another became entangled in the meshes of the net, fell softly&#xD;
upon Walter's ear, through the hush of night, and carried his&#xD;
mind in holy, pensive thought, back to the recorded scenes&#xD;
of the fishermen of Galilee.&#xD;
The catch, the next day, did not justify the expectation&#xD;
they had reasonably entertained. The presence of live bait&#xD;
in profusion, and especially the species which they had so&#xD;
abundantly taken, is regarded by the old fishermen, as indica-&#xD;
tive of the presence of shoals of voracious fishes, ready to&#xD;
grab at anything in the shape of bait ; or, at least, to be the&#xD;
immediate harbingers of them. It was evident, then, they&#xD;
had only to wait patiently a few days, when full room for&#xD;
their activity would be found. But the spell of home was&#xD;

&#xD;
broken, and hurried away by that impatience which movement&#xD;
in itself begets, the skipper ordered the sails to be trimmed&#xD;
for pushing further on.&#xD;
On and on they stivered, sounding less and less frequently,&#xD;
until the monotony of sailing enveloped them. At last, all&#xD;
seemed to have become pinioned to their bunks, by that kind&#xD;
goddess, Sleep, rarely crawling therefrom except for meals.&#xD;
This they called bottling up sleep for future occasion.&#xD;
" Land, 0!" shouted the helmsman. The cry ran through&#xD;
the vessel, and, in a moment, the slumbering crew had broken&#xD;
the bonds of Morpheus, and were huddled upon deck, strain-&#xD;
ing their eyes, some to make out the precise locality of the&#xD;
coast, and others to feast the sense upon the banquet of a&#xD;
novel scene. The first sight of land at sea is' a blessed&#xD;
vision.&#xD;
It proved to be the Eastern Coast. A brisk wind was&#xD;
blowing in upon the land; and the chopping waves thwarted&#xD;
by the adverse current, were so considerable as to give an&#xD;
unusually dizzying motion to the vessel. The land which at&#xD;
first seemed to touch the sky, as they neared, swelled out,&#xD;
through the translucent atmosphere, having a mellow, dreamy&#xD;
look, well calculated to touch in a lively manner the Fancy.&#xD;
The novel scene dissipated for the moment the gnawing&#xD;
home-sickness of Walter, and filled him with intense curios-&#xD;
ity.&#xD;
On they went, ploughing their way down along the coast.&#xD;
The next morning the skipper judged himself off the outward&#xD;
entrance of the gut of Canso. The vessel was now headed in&#xD;
for land. They soon rounded in by 'a jagged promontory,&#xD;
and after crossing, a deep bay, they entered a narrow strait,&#xD;
and finally came to in a cosy little cove near  he shore. The&#xD;
change from the tumbling motion of the vessel at sea, and the&#xD;
raw ocean breeze, to the quiet gliding motion upon the sur-&#xD;
&#xD;
face of the land-locked waters, fanned by the soft impregnated&#xD;
air from dale and forest, all enlivrened by the novel and va-&#xD;
riegated scenery by which they were surrounded, was sweetly&#xD;
refreshing to the Fisher Boy.&#xD;
Scarcely anchored, and the sails furled, or "the vessel&#xD;
snugly tied up," in the quaint language of Marl,-when a&#xD;
small black boat was seen approaching from the shore. On&#xD;
reaching the vessel, three men jumped on board ; and one&#xD;
raising lis ha to the skipper, asted him wIh an air of&#xD;
mingled authority and respect. They proved to be rather&#xD;
uncouth specimens of English Officials, or as Marl had it,&#xD;
"the fag end of John Bull."  They had certainly a blousy,&#xD;
besotted look, and a surly filching manner, but there was a&#xD;
tone of manly frankness in the few jerked, growling sentences&#xD;
they condescended to give from time to time, that went far to&#xD;
redeem the otherwise unamiable impression they left. Still, a&#xD;
rude, outlandish style proved them but rough beings, plants&#xD;
that had vegetated outside the flowery garden of the world's&#xD;
intercourse. They had come in the dignity of the English&#xD;
crown to see that no article subject to duty was on board.&#xD;
But after receiving from the skipper a stiff glass or two of&#xD;
grog, a junk of pork, and a parcel of tobacco, they deemed it&#xD;
hardly worth while to institute further search. They believed&#xD;
on the whole, the Yankees too honest to be caught smuggling;&#xD;
so with a hearty blessing upon the whole Yankee nation, they&#xD;
took a gracious leave.&#xD;
The next forenoon was spent ashore by a part of the crew,&#xD;
some in filling water, others in cutting poles for gaff handles,&#xD;
'etc. This over, all were let loose for relaxation. The license&#xD;
was lustily enjoyed. Running, jumping, leaping, scrambling&#xD;
over rocks, and such like athletics as give the limbs a vigorous&#xD;
pleasure, after being tied to confined quarters, were pronis-&#xD;
cuously indulged. Walter among the rest felt a novel pleas-&#xD;

CHAPTER XI.&#xD;
" Calamity is man's true touchstone."&#xD;

" THUMjip, thump, thump," came heavily down the large end&#xD;
of a handspike upon the deck before the gangway. "All&#xD;
hands ahoy. Fish, 0! Fish, 0! They are here, double&#xD;
game twice running," hurriedly bawled Fishall, - and he was&#xD;
off in a twinkling, sawing away again at his line. The crew&#xD;
needed no second call this time. The inspiring sound of&#xD;
"Fish, 0," the balmy state from enjoyed rest, the fresh feel-&#xD;
ing from pleasant scenes passed through, all helped forward a&#xD;
vigor, that sent them bounding up the gangway, most eager&#xD;
to feel the first pulsation of success.&#xD;
In a moment, all were at the rail, in the highest ardor of&#xD;
activity. The completest silence reigned, as if utterance had&#xD;
seethed out amid the- fervor of intense eagerness. Fishall&#xD;
with hat and jacket off, and sleeves rolled up, was bending to&#xD;
the sport, with a freedom, agility, and precision, that be-&#xD;
tokened the adroit sportsman.&#xD;
The broad bosom of the sea, slightly rippled by a feeble,&#xD;
penetrating breeze, presented an aspect of quiet serenity.&#xD;
One or two large ships well in the offing to the North, were&#xD;
pursuing their solitary way, seeming on the very verge of&#xD;
civilization. The atmosphere was of that cold transparency&#xD;
seen in high latitudes. But when the sun sprang from his&#xD;

briny couch, and flung his radiance over the broad expanse,&#xD;
all around shone, as if touched with a magic pencil.&#xD;
Still, to the sensitive imagination of Walter, it seemed that&#xD;
he had been flung to another sphere, unknown to the soft,&#xD;
green earth of his home ; and when the images of his -mother,&#xD;
and loved ones came thronging upon his mind, he could not&#xD;
but suppress a tear of regret. But lie was quick to dissemble&#xD;
the tender sentiment: and lie threw himself into the ardor of&#xD;
activity, as if his heart were in the catch, instead of far away&#xD;
amid the scenes of his youth.&#xD;
The water here was so shallow, not more than thirty fatlh-&#xD;
omns, and the bite so lively and uniform, that ere the morning&#xD;
was far advanced, each had filled his kid, and was counting&#xD;
out upon deck, keeping his own tally.&#xD;
There lay the handsome cod, vanquished by the art of man,&#xD;
shorn of the glory of their native element, flapping and gasp-&#xD;
ing in the fierce rays of the rising sun, their crimson-arched&#xD;
gills, palpitating in the keen anguish of a fatal death-throe.&#xD;
Cruel, avaricious man ! if every pang thou hast inflicted upon&#xD;
mute suffering creation, were to rise up in judgment against&#xD;
thee, what a mountain of condemnation would impend over&#xD;
thy guilty head.&#xD;
But sentiment aside, what exercise more inspiriting and&#xD;
withal more healthful, than taking codfish with hook and line.&#xD;
The firm, erect, well poised attitude in hauling, the vigor-&#xD;
ous action of the muscles of the chest and arms, combine to&#xD;
develop muscular energy, while the mental stimulus is such&#xD;
as to impart that glow of animation without which exercise&#xD;
has little efficiency.&#xD;
Try it, ye waning mortals, whose sluggish "pulse and hectic&#xD;
breath show ye alas in the downhill road of life. Throw to&#xD;
the winds your thousand and one nostrums, and speed to the&#xD;
deck of a fishing vessel. My word for it one trip of hearty&#xD;
&#xD;
fishing life, will more avail to restore that blessed boon, health&#xD;
than all the endeavors of a score of the most sagacious of the&#xD;
sons of Esculapius.&#xD;
The excitement became so general (perhaps the conditional&#xD;
promise of a new hat in the fall, contributed its share of influ-&#xD;
ence) as to draw the cook likewise into the sport, which per-&#xD;
sonage divided most devotedly his time between his line and&#xD;
the pot.&#xD;
Hence, late it was before the greeting sound of breakfast&#xD;
came forth ; and then even the-usual scrambling toward the&#xD;
gangway did not take place. An earnest feeling held hunger&#xD;
at the time at bay. Yet at length one after another stole off&#xD;
below, snatched a bite, and-was so quickly back to his line, as&#xD;
to have made it hardly possible to be missed. The genius of&#xD;
Yankee greed-getting could hardly have exacted anything&#xD;
more fhitliful.&#xD;
Early in the afternoon, the bite began to slacken. But the&#xD;
skipper instead of taking it moderately in the beginning&#xD;
that is, knocking off in season to complete dressing down be-&#xD;
fore night, pursued that very common course of overreaching&#xD;
gain, which commonly defeats its own end,--and had the&#xD;
crew remain at the rail, 'till sunset. This l)rought them far&#xD;
into the night, before the fishes could be put snugly under the&#xD;
deck. Keeping so late hours, might have been borne for one&#xD;
night, but it was repeated time and ag'a in fishing all day, and&#xD;
dressing half the night, until poori human nature could hardly&#xD;
stand up under it longer.&#xD;
As for Walter, he came soon to being nearly used up, to em-&#xD;
ploy a libernianism. The eternal dressing down over, it was&#xD;
with much ado, that he could drag his weary limbs down the&#xD;
gangway, to the supper table. Here, so complete was physi-&#xD;
cal prostration, that as hunger ridden as he was, his spoonful&#xD;
of squeal was as likely to be poured into his bosom, as into-&#xD;

But to muster at the cry of all hands in the morning.&#xD;
Aye, that was the rub. Eyes glued in sleep, fingers sore,&#xD;
swollen, and the joints stiff as an iron poker, the body lame&#xD;
from over exertion, and the whole sense steeped in slumber,&#xD;
as if rolling in the waves of Lethe. Indeed, the effort was&#xD;
next to impossible.&#xD;
Akin to this in trial, was the turning out in the night to&#xD;
stand watch. At so high latitude in mid-summer, the nights&#xD;
were at most, but short. They were moreover greatly clipped&#xD;
by the dressings down, which oftener than otherwise ran into&#xD;
midnight. So that with the number of hands on board, ex-&#xD;
tending nearly to a baker's dozen, the watch came round to&#xD;
each only at long intervals. Yet those intervals were far too&#xD;
short for Walter.&#xD;
The duty of calling Walter, could not but tax very sorely&#xD;
the patience of the unlucky mortal whose watch preceded the&#xD;
boy's. For to speak the sleeper's name, or even shake him&#xD;
pretty vigorously by the collar, had no more effect than it&#xD;
would to shout in the ear of a deaf sunfish. The only way&#xD;
that proved effectual in arousing the boy, was to tumble him&#xD;
out of his bunk, give him a stout shaking upon the chest; or,&#xD;
perchance, drag him upon deck into the midnight air.&#xD;
The man who called Walter, took care always before going&#xD;
below, to reiterate the injunction, to keep a bright look out for&#xD;
ships that were crossing in their wake up and down the St.&#xD;
Lawrence. But one of these huge sailing leviathans, might&#xD;
&#xD;
at any time have swallowed the tiny Pink Stern, without&#xD;
the boy's being a whit wiser for the incident, so completely&#xD;
did he become in a moment after enwrapped in the folds of&#xD;
slumber.&#xD;
Moreover, whenever his watch came in the night, the rest&#xD;
of the crew had good reason to thank the boy for the luxury&#xD;
of a morning doze. For not only were the watchers that fol-&#xD;
lowed left to slumber on, but more likely than not the sun&#xD;
would get well up the arch before there was any mustering at&#xD;
all, and then not unless some veteran fisherman had awaked&#xD;
of himself, and so aroused the others.&#xD;
In this stupor of sleep, Walter might have remained till the&#xD;
crack of doom, but for some overmastering agency. This&#xD;
sometimes came in that intolerable thirst, more powerful even&#xD;
than the drench of slumber. He would then suddenly awake,&#xD;
parched with an excruciating longing for water.&#xD;
The oppressive air through which the cabin lamp feebly&#xD;
rays, seems like a lurid taper in a damp sepulchre. The hard&#xD;
breathings of the slumberers, to say nothing of many a lugu-&#xD;
brious sound, falls upon his sense like the spirit of the night-&#xD;
mare, and makes him fancy himself in a tomb of resuscitating&#xD;
spirits.&#xD;
Crawling over old Loggy who lies as inanimate as .a dead&#xD;
whale, and stumbling at length upon an unwashed tin cap,&#xD;
from the cook's scanty cupboard, he is not long in making&#xD;
way to the water-bucket in the dirtiest nook of the cabin,&#xD;
thoroughly begrimmed as it is without, and loaded with recre-&#xD;
ment within.&#xD;
The foetid odor of the water, from lack of ventilation in&#xD;
the barrel, and especially the innumerable bits of scum float-&#xD;
ing thickly through the liquid, would seem to render the&#xD;
draught loathsome enough of itself; but thirst has the power&#xD;
to parch up delicacy of taste, and to change the disgusting&#xD;

into the grateful. How supremely sweet were not those&#xD;
draughts! The nectar of the gods could not have been more&#xD;
delicious !&#xD;
For a few days, it had been blowing so brisk a norther, as&#xD;
to forbid any attempt at fish-taking. Accordingly, the rail&#xD;
was abandoned, and the wee nook of a cabin became for the&#xD;
time being their hearth of life. This gave a joyful respite to&#xD;
sore fingers and jaded muscles, and the work-ridden crew,&#xD;
blessed the god of storms for the boon. It was rough without,&#xD;
but balmy repose gilded the horizon within.&#xD;
Fishall had the watch on deck. - The rest of the crew were&#xD;
complacently ensconced in the cabin, when unexpectedly a&#xD;
voice shouted at the top of the gangway,&#xD;
"Gone -the rudder's gone ! Sure's I'm a living man; saw&#xD;
it sink right out of sight."&#xD;
"Don't say," groaned Loggy, dismally.&#xD;
Old Marl darted upon deck, and in a moment returned,&#xD;
verifying the astounding intelligence. The crew were struck&#xD;
with an amazement bordering upon alarm; and well they&#xD;
might be, being as they were, upon a strange coast, more than&#xD;
a hundred miles from a convenient harbor, with no rudder to&#xD;
their vessel! Hardly could a situation seem more disheart-&#xD;
ening, if not perilous.&#xD;
But the skipper seemed not in the least daunted. He had&#xD;
schooled himself into the belief, that all things in the end&#xD;
work for the best ; and he showed himself in this case, one of'&#xD;
those very few philosophers whose practice accords with their&#xD;
precepts. Still, as he pondered it over, the mortal difficulty&#xD;
of getting back to the Gut of Canso, without rudder, stared&#xD;
him in the face rather sternly. It seemed very like driving a&#xD;
horse through the main street of a populous city, without reins&#xD;
to guide. Disquietude weighed all the more heavily, from&#xD;
the novelty of their situation. At sea without a rudder !&#xD;
&#xD;
Who had ever heard    of a like situation! Accustomed&#xD;
troubles bring accustomed fortitude, but a new difficulty is&#xD;
accompanied by a strange feeling of embarrassment, appalling&#xD;
to the energies. But obstacles are vanquished by marching&#xD;
upon them with a bold step, and the pace forward is quick-&#xD;
ened, by the stern necessity which throws us upon the foe&#xD;
with no choice of retreat. The skipper and Old Marl, had&#xD;
both got in the school of life not a little of that fortitude, that&#xD;
meets with calmness a trying situation, strengthened by an&#xD;
inward force that rises superior to misfortune.&#xD;
As soon as the gale had enough moderated, the anchor was&#xD;
weighed, when her bow fell off with a fair wind. Sailing&#xD;
before it, like riding down hill, would seem an easy affair.&#xD;
And it may be, when one has a firm check-rein to his horse,&#xD;
or a sure rudder to the stern of his vessel, but without those&#xD;
convenient appendages, it becomes rather an awkward feat.&#xD;
After many fruitless attempts to manage the steering of the&#xD;
vessel, they finally hit upon the following successful expe-&#xD;
dient. The jib and foresail set, the mainsail was hoisted&#xD;
partly up. One man then stood with compass before him on&#xD;
the hatch, and main-peak halliards in hand. Hoisting the&#xD;
peak ever so slightly, caused the vessel to luff; and lowering&#xD;
it again, her bow would fall off. Thus, a tolerably straight&#xD;
wake could be made. Whichever way the wind, they found&#xD;
by a little judgment in trimming sails, the sprightly craft&#xD;
could be steered with wonderful ease. But what put the&#xD;
climax to their success, was sailing by the wind; or more as-&#xD;
tonishingly still in beating to windward. This, when it was&#xD;
smooth, they could do most admirably. The magic manou-&#xD;
vre was performed in this wise. The jib and foresheets were&#xD;
hauled close aft. The main-sheet left about a point free,&#xD;
when the thing of life as if proud of her ability, would glide&#xD;
forward, keeping the luff of the mainsail barely lighting in&#xD;

&#xD;
the breeze, and making a wake as direct as the course of the&#xD;
wind itself.&#xD;
To about ship, they had only to ease off the fore and jib-&#xD;
sheets, haul close aft the main-sheet, when the knowhg thing&#xD;
would turn upon her heel, as pertly as a country maiden in a&#xD;
waltz. Indeed, one day in company with a number of ves-&#xD;
sels, she outstripped them all in readiness and precision of&#xD;
working, and left them all ere long well off in the distance to&#xD;
the leeward. Not one of these vessels in any probability for&#xD;
once imagined that the little craft that had thus so beaten&#xD;
them, was destitute of rudder.&#xD;
Every one aboard felt, and with good reason, a keen glow&#xD;
of satisfaction at the striking success they had met with, in&#xD;
their very novel mode of managing a vessel. Intense anxiety&#xD;
now gave place to serene joy..&#xD;
In the rubbish of the world's doings, there is many a feat&#xD;
of skill by humble hands, that needs but a fortunate setting,&#xD;
to make it admirably famous._&#xD;
"What's the use of a helm at all," at length broke forth&#xD;
Fishall, in a gratulatory tone.  " For, without one, we sail&#xD;
better it seems, get along faster, and save our trick in the&#xD;
bargain. When I build myship, I'll leave out the rudder,&#xD;
I think. What say you, Mr. Marl ?"&#xD;
" Well, I'll hardly go so far as that," drawled the Salt,&#xD;
thoughtfully, "but I'll agree, that if Captains would attend&#xD;
more closely to trimming sail, there'd be less occasion to find&#xD;
fault with helmsmen. Yes," he added, "widening in thought,&#xD;
I'll not doubt there's vastly too much steering in the world --,"&#xD;
too much leaning upon old musty guides, and not enough&#xD;
standing upon one's own royal judgment."&#xD;
"How's that? " inquired Fishall, evidently a little be-&#xD;
wildered by being thus suddenly drawn into the region of&#xD;
generalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Why," continued the sailor, " to make the thing more&#xD;
clear, there's your book worm of a student for example. He's&#xD;
forever grubbing away, amid the decayed mould of the past,&#xD;
feeding upon defunct notions and exploded theories. True, his&#xD;
cranium gets filled, but 'tis with a kind of lumber, that leaves&#xD;
his puny soul in but a rickety'condition at best. If he'd make&#xD;
use of his wasted time, and misspent energies in searching the&#xD;
clew to the mysteries to the great, living, beating world&#xD;
around him, he'd become for all useful ends, I fancy, quite&#xD;
as wise, and, furthermore, would thereby catch a spark or two&#xD;
of vitality to animate his step through this crowded mart of&#xD;
life."&#xD;
"Can you mention another case ?" inquired the skipper,&#xD;
his eyes sparkling with interest.&#xD;
"Yes," replied the sailor, "there's woman, magnificent&#xD;
woman, decking herself in the flimsy trickery of Fashion,&#xD;
spreading  all canvas to outstrip  her  sex, and  steer&#xD;
straight into the port of Matrimony. Can she not per-&#xD;
ceive that good sensible man, must look upon all such low&#xD;
arts, as the mere scum of vanity ; that his royal nature can&#xD;
be brought to love only what is pure, noble, and free of&#xD;
guile.&#xD;
" But the very worst steered craft that I know of, is the&#xD;
ship of State. Every year or so, likely as not, a green skip-&#xD;
per and a bran new crew come aboard, and what with the ig-.&#xD;
norance of their new place, and their vanity of making a show&#xD;
of doing something, they bring the good oldship to make but&#xD;
a crooked track of it. If the noble craft were left more to&#xD;
her own bearings, she'd fetch about a better turn of it, I&#xD;
fancy."&#xD;
The attention of the speaker was at this moment drawn off&#xD;
by the appearance of a dark.cloud rising'in the north-western&#xD;
horizon. Vivid glimmerings and forked chains of lightning&#xD;
&#xD;
TVMO RALIZING.                  187'&#xD;

&#xD;
would light up in rapid succession its sombre lid, and then&#xD;
play upon its lowering brow, like fiery spirits caressing the&#xD;
sublime Genii of the heavens.&#xD;
"A savage looking customer, that," mused Marl, cast-&#xD;
ing doubtful glances, alternately at the cloud, and the&#xD;
tiny sails of the vessel. "A  bell weather of the flock, to&#xD;
appearance. 'Twould be on the safe side to dowse our&#xD;
calico."&#xD;
The skipper gave prompt orders to take in sail at once.&#xD;
The crew sprang like men who act before the quickening&#xD;
menace of danger; and by the time the canvas was secured,&#xD;
the heavens were grimly enshrouded, as with the pall of mid-&#xD;
night. The gentle leading breeze against which the vessel&#xD;
had borne her way so adroitly, now quietly vanished, as if&#xD;
borne off in a winding sheet of death. The calm was stark,&#xD;
breathless. The threatening elements like embattled war-&#xD;
riors, just on the eve of a terrible onslaught, stood face to&#xD;
face, silent, moody, ominous. The stillness was the hush of&#xD;
the grave-side.&#xD;
In a moment it came ; first, the wind, in a sweeping, furious&#xD;
gust; as if it were about to snatch the mortal breath out of&#xD;
one ; then the rain, in driving, pelting, pouring torrents.&#xD;
Indeed, it seemed that the very windows of heaven had been&#xD;
opened, and that the Deity had repented himself of having&#xD;
.vouchsafed to man immunity from another flood. The deep&#xD;
toned thunder roared and bellowed like a maddened bull. It&#xD;
commingled with the jarring,, frenzied elements, in startling&#xD;
confusion, and seemed every moment on the point of breaking&#xD;
its chains of confinement, to fall upon the devoted heads of&#xD;
all.&#xD;
The harpy lightning shot through the wild gloom in fiery&#xD;
vividness, leaping, from mast to deck with the ferocity of a&#xD;
rabid animal.&#xD;
&#xD;
The peak of the jib had been left standing just to steady&#xD;
her before the wind, when under the herculean force of the&#xD;
gale, she flew off with the speed of an arrow, and with a rush&#xD;
of motion that actually caught up the breath with intensity of&#xD;
thrill.&#xD;
Walter had shared largely the evil of that miserable&#xD;
dealing with children,, which ends in making them afraid&#xD;
of their own shadow -not from the kind, common-sense&#xD;
philosophy of, his mother, but from  the silly, superstition&#xD;
of early teachers and associates. He could not sit with&#xD;
quiet nerves at home, amidst the roaring of a violent&#xD;
thunder-storm. What then must have been his trepidation at&#xD;
sea, with all the elements of terror greatly increased?  But&#xD;
he constantly strove with earnest purpose, to get the better&#xD;
of this weakness, and, in this instance, he at length so mas-&#xD;
tered his quailing emotions, as Partially to enjoy the grandeur&#xD;
of the scene.&#xD;
It was now evident the craft had got the full weight of the&#xD;
gale, and she was careering on before the mighty aerial cur-&#xD;
rent in thrilling majesty. Marl was standing near the fore&#xD;
shrouds in an attitude of cairn contemplation, evidently in that&#xD;
entranced state of soul, to which sublime scenes of nature ele-&#xD;
vate imperial spirits, when all of a sudden, the stalwart sailor&#xD;
fetched a twitch and a writhe, as if shot by the spark of a&#xD;
double galvanic battery; and sending up a -shout that was&#xD;
heard above even the roar of the tempest, "Man overboard!"&#xD;
he sprang abaftward, his eyes wild with excitement, his face&#xD;
haggard with intense solicitude, and every limb swelling with&#xD;
leaping force.&#xD;
Every article of a floating nature that could possibly afford&#xD;
a chance boon to the drowning man, was instantly seized and&#xD;
thrown into the sea, regardless of its cost or value. The lash-&#xD;
ings of the boat stowed amidships were cut at a stroke. For-&#xD;

THE FISHER BOt.&#xD;
&#xD;
tunately at this moment the gale lulled ; the jib was lowered,&#xD;
and hoisting the peak of the main-sail brought the Pink head&#xD;
to the wind. Overboard now flew the boat, and in leaped&#xD;
Marl, Fishall, and another..&#xD;
They pulled with frenzied energy toward the lost man.&#xD;
Around and around they rowed the conjectured spot where&#xD;
he fell, hallooing and shouting till the shades of night began&#xD;
to appear. The vessel meanwhile seconded their efforts by&#xD;
sailing and tacking near them, and occasionally firing a gun.&#xD;
But all was vain. No human figure could be descried; no&#xD;
human voice heard. Nought broke - the stillness save the&#xD;
mocking sound of the clashing waters. It was the silence of&#xD;
death. He had gone; had sunk to rise no more; his brief&#xD;
span was over; his bubble of life burst. -low sad, how&#xD;
mournful, how solemn! .But a moment before in the full&#xD;
energy and young prime of years, without a note of warning, a&#xD;
staying hand for kindly succor, or a sympathizing tear to soothe&#xD;
the dread passage, he was hurried to that bourne whence no&#xD;
traveller returns.&#xD;
Surely, "in life, aie we in the midst of death."&#xD;
At length, they returned on board, with heads bent in sol-&#xD;
emn dejection upon their breasts ; and with hearts of sadness,&#xD;
the vessel was put again upon her course.&#xD;
The drowned man, it seemed, went out on the bowsprit, in&#xD;
order to secure more completely the furled part of the jib.&#xD;
While returning, his feet slipping from the foot-rope, he drop-&#xD;
ped into the water, and was passed over by the vessel. He,&#xD;
nevertheless, came up close astern, sprang half his length&#xD;
above the surface, throwing up at the same time, his arms in&#xD;
a gesture of forlorn distress, accompanied by a cry of anguish,&#xD;
so bitter as to pierce to the core the sternest heart. A good&#xD;
swimmer, he instinctively struck out toward the vessel, and&#xD;
when last seen was buffeting the angry billows with the&#xD;
energy of despair.&#xD;
&#xD;
A MELANChOLY NIGHT.&#xD;
&#xD;
191&#xD;
&#xD;
Ah, what must have been his feelings, when all hope of&#xD;
rescue at last faded forever from his vision, -when the stern,&#xD;
dreadful reality of a final farewell to earth stared him irre-&#xD;
vocably to view, and the horrors of a watery grave closed in&#xD;
upon his soul.&#xD;
How sad and melancholy hung that night over the&#xD;
thoughtful crew !  So sudden, so unexpected . a death, in&#xD;
their very midst    One of their little band, a band&#xD;
knit closely by the common links of exposure and hard-&#xD;
ship; snatched, as it were, from them, taken just before&#xD;
their eyes, in the full flush of life, and hurled without a&#xD;
single note of warning, to the surging, angry, relentless bil-&#xD;
lows.&#xD;
How   vividly it impressed  them  with the   uncertain&#xD;
tenure of life ! How  it quickened their apprehension of&#xD;
the element at whose meicy they were. floating!   With&#xD;
what awful terror it clothed the memory of the fatal gale&#xD;
which like a stealthy murderer had come so direfully upon&#xD;
them.&#xD;
The deceased possessed a kind heart, an equable temper,&#xD;
and a spirit of fhitlifuliiess to duty. Moved by that amiable&#xD;
principle of human nature, by which the virtues only of the&#xD;
departed are dwelt upon, these rough men, but with hearts of&#xD;
woman's tenderness, had many a good thing to narrate of&#xD;
their lost companion.&#xD;
But it was a night of harrowing disquietude, especially to&#xD;
Walter. The shock of the- awful scene continued to agitate&#xD;
him like a troubled sea. The imploring attitude of the dying&#xD;
man, and above all, that unearthly shriek pressed still upon&#xD;
his soul like a haunting incubus.&#xD;

&#xD;
scrambling out of their berths, and making all possible haste&#xD;
to reach the deck.&#xD;
As Walter gained the deck, behold, the vessel so far turned&#xD;
over on her side, as to bring the water quite up to the lower&#xD;
combing of the hatch-way. Everything loose upon deck had&#xD;
either tumbled into the water or floated from off the deck,&#xD;
and all swept from sight by the current. The unlucky vessel&#xD;
was evidently in imminent peril of upsetting. Partially load-&#xD;
ed with fish and salt, she must have sunk direct to the bottom.&#xD;
The moment was one, then, of real alarm.&#xD;
But, fortunately, one of the inhabitants ashore happening&#xD;
about midnight to pass along the beach toward home, was&#xD;
struck by the unhappy predicament of the Pink. Surmising&#xD;
the cause, in a friendly spirit he quickly alarmed his neigh-&#xD;
bors, who as promptly turned out, and sprang forward to the&#xD;
rescue. Presently, the dark line of the shore seemed crowd-&#xD;
ed with forms dimly visible through the gray folds of night,&#xD;
suggestive to the imagination of benignant spirits from the&#xD;
regions of Pluto.&#xD;
Shouting lustily until they had awakened the crew on&#xD;
board, like men who apprehend at a glance the secret turn of&#xD;
a crisis, they suggested readily the means of relief.. A haw-&#xD;
ser bent to an anchor ashore, and hitched to the main and fore&#xD;
halliards aboard, kept the hapless Pink from turning further&#xD;
over until she was righted, and finally floated off by the in-&#xD;
coming tide.&#xD;
The way in which the vessel evidently fell into the odd&#xD;
dilemma was now pointed out to them by the friendly shore-&#xD;
men, who, with good reason, congratulated the skipper, upon&#xD;
so lucky an escape. A wicked, sunken rock nestled in the&#xD;
harbor, over which, during the night, the Pink had swung,&#xD;
with the change of wind. On the ebbing of the- tide, which&#xD;
is not inconsiderable in these latitudes, the keel caught upon&#xD;

CHAPTER       XII.&#xD;
"Hail, Holy Day! the blessing from above&#xD;
Brightens thy presence like a smile of love,&#xD;
Smoothing, iie oil upon a stormy sea,&#xD;
The roughest waves of lunan destiny -&#xD;
Cheering the good, and to the poor oppressed&#xD;
Bearing the promise of their heavenly rest."&#xD;
"THREADING this needle will be no easy matter, I fancy,"&#xD;
mused Marl. Indeed, to succeed entering the harbor, did&#xD;
look, as if it might prove a perplexing feat. True, out in the&#xD;
bay, with a plenty of sea-room, they had contrived well&#xD;
enough to get along, but to run in through a narrow winding&#xD;
passage, with a strong breeze upon the quarter, was quite a&#xD;
different affair. But they had proceeded now quite too far,&#xD;
to turn back or even to hesitate. So, by the aid of a couple&#xD;
of long oars at the stern, and tending sheets pretty sharply,&#xD;
they did succeed in achieving the passage, and soon came&#xD;
securely at anchor in the harbor to the no little amazement&#xD;
of the inhabitants of the place, who had gathered wonderingly&#xD;
upon the shores, to witness so unusual a spectacle as a vessel&#xD;
running into their harbor without a;rudder.&#xD;
Excessively fatigued, all hands turned in early for a sound&#xD;
night's rest; but before many hours, Walter awakened, and&#xD;
found a strange bustling in the cabin. To his amazement the&#xD;
vessel was so careened, as to render it impossible standing&#xD;
erect upon the floor of the cabin, and the crew generally were&#xD;

REST IN PROSPECT.              195&#xD;
&#xD;
ii&#xD;
&#xD;
a verge of the rock which tripped the unsuspecting craft, as&#xD;
many a storm-beaten mortal, at length moored in self-security&#xD;
in some placid harbor of life, is suddenly struck by the fang of&#xD;
a secret enemy, at a time when dreaming of no evil.&#xD;
Early in the morning, the crew set out in quest of the arti-&#xD;
cles that had been swept from the deck of the Pink, in their&#xD;
night's strange vicissitude. A few of the least valuable of&#xD;
these were at once found upon the beach, where they had&#xD;
been left, high and dry, by the receding tide. A few others&#xD;
were at length discovered, behind hillocks and amid thickets,&#xD;
where they had evidently been secreted by covetous hands.&#xD;
But of the bulk of the straying articles no clew, whatever, as&#xD;
to their whereabouts could be traced.&#xD;
What struck the crew as a strange episode, in their search,&#xD;
was, that on touching the shore they were greeted by several&#xD;
of the same men who had lent them so efficient aid during&#xD;
the night just passed ; and who now proffered them the most&#xD;
cordial assistance to discover the missing articles, or ferret out&#xD;
any one who might have, been so base as to steal them.&#xD;
They even swore roundly at the inhumanity of any one who&#xD;
could think of robbing the stranger and the cast-away. But&#xD;
strange to say, it turned out in the sequel, that these very&#xD;
persons were, beyond doubt, among the guilty ones ; and that&#xD;
this little plausibility was merely a trick, to lead away sus-&#xD;
picion by false pretence.&#xD;
It is not the least among the anomalies of human character&#xD;
that men can be found who, at one moment will pour out their&#xD;
sympathies, like water, in succoring a distressed fellow mortal,&#xD;
and at the next, rob this brother being of the coat even from&#xD;
off his back. Men - shall we call them such ?-- who can look&#xD;
unaffected upon death itself, if some trivial article of acquisition&#xD;
come between them and the dread scene ; can even rifle the&#xD;
dead body, cut from the swollen finger of the cold corpse the&#xD;
&#xD;
last simple jewel of affection, the heart-felt token, it may be,&#xD;
of a mother's undying love. But this dire phase of pervert-&#xD;
ed human character may too often be met with in any places,&#xD;
greatly exposed to shipwreck. It shows the sad depths of&#xD;
human degradation to which the morbid passion of gain will&#xD;
hurry the soul.&#xD;
A rudder was at length with some difficulty completed, and&#xD;
securely hung. After being paid for, by a draft upon the&#xD;
owners in the States, they cheerily set sail, and ere long, were&#xD;
again upon their former fishing ground in the bay.&#xD;
Here, the fishes showed no abatement from their former&#xD;
eagerness for taking the hook, and all hands soon became&#xD;
again dragged down with the toil of catching.&#xD;
" The last fish this week, and I'm only too glad of it," joy-&#xD;
fully broke forth Fishall, as late of a Saturday night his knife&#xD;
came down upon the splitting table, with a more lively ring&#xD;
than usual.&#xD;
The soothing anticipation of the morrow's rest held a ling-&#xD;
ering charm over their minds, and their simple supper was&#xD;
despatched with a zest of spirits bordering upon hilarity.&#xD;
Even their usual eagerness for retiring was relaxed, as if to&#xD;
prolong the present enjoyment of future delight.&#xD;
Ah, how grateful upon the jaded spirit of the fisherman&#xD;
falls the quiet shadows of a more than Cotter's Saturday night.&#xD;
It seems to him as if an angel stooping from heaven, and un-&#xD;
locking the huge door barred for six days, by grim Labor, lets&#xD;
him into the sweet banquet hall of Nature.&#xD;
On awaking the next morning, Walter found all the rest of&#xD;
the crew, save the skipper and cook, snoring and puffing in&#xD;
their berths, as if struggling for dear life with that old arch&#xD;
giant, Slumber,&#xD;
" Weariness&#xD;
Can snore upon the flint, when resty sloth&#xD;
Finds the down-pillow hard."&#xD;

196             THE FISHER .BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
The skipper, seated upon the narrow end of the transom,&#xD;
near the dingy fire-place, was actually lending a gracious&#xD;
hand at getting the breakfast, while glee-hearted Dunder-&#xD;
fish, but too glad to be for once relieved from  the heat&#xD;
and smoke of his everlasting drudgery, and not a little elated&#xD;
at the thought of so much dignity gracing his office, was danc-&#xD;
ing attendance upon the skipper's every behest, with all the&#xD;
deference and promptitude of a newly appointed knight&#xD;
squire. By his side loomed a couple of kids heaped with&#xD;
tempting doughnuts, fried in fresh liver fat, and still the&#xD;
fierce work continued to go on.&#xD;
In due time, breakfast in full was joyously brought forth&#xD;
upon the table. It consisted ofstacks of brownly crisped&#xD;
nuts, hot wheat bread, butter, nice corned cod boiled, and&#xD;
coffee. Surely such a repast might have tempted the dainty&#xD;
palate of a king. Then how sweetly inviting must it not have&#xD;
been to the gaunt appetite of the squeal-famished crew. How-&#xD;
ever stilted philosophy may-affect to contemn the pleasures of&#xD;
appetite, to a hungry man there are few things in life more&#xD;
welcome than a good savory meal. As the grateful odor&#xD;
curled up from the smoking viands, the crew were not laggard&#xD;
in mustering to the call to breakfast. Out they come rolling&#xD;
from their berths, yawning and grunting, fetching that pe-&#xD;
culiar kind of grunt which is indicative of inward satisfitction.&#xD;
Without giving themselves the trouble of doing their toilet,&#xD;
or of even dressing, they squat themselves around the table,&#xD;
and commenced without ceremony attacking the breast-work&#xD;
of edibles, like men bent upon vanquishing. The scene was&#xD;
such as to confound the notions of those fastidious people who&#xD;
insist upon morning ablutions, elaborate toilet, and thorough&#xD;
mastication at the table.&#xD;
Breakfast over, each rolled himself back into his berth in&#xD;
order to complete the morning's doze. And two or three of&#xD;
&#xD;
II&#xD;
&#xD;
the crew, under the grip of their somnambulent powers, passed&#xD;
off into a profound slumber, that lasted till toward noon.. But&#xD;
for the most of them, the claims of digestion proved too ex-&#xD;
acting; and after tossing restlessly from side to side, with vain&#xD;
effort to court sleep, one after another bolted upon deck for a&#xD;
quaff of the morning sunshine. The Sabbath morn greeted&#xD;
them with clapping hands; all around, in sky and upon ocean,&#xD;
wore a serene, pensive smile ; and a sweet, holy emotion&#xD;
blossomed up in their freshened hearts.&#xD;
Whatever of damp clothing that could be mustered from&#xD;
.the cabin, was now spread upon deck for an airing; and while&#xD;
some of the crew were employed in the hold, packing the&#xD;
kentches of fish, in order to economize room, others might&#xD;
have been seen jogging away at the pump, to remove the&#xD;
pickle that had accumulated from the salted fishes.&#xD;
These duties over, each made the most of the pint of fresh&#xD;
water prudence allowed him to take for a personal wash.&#xD;
Sore fingers were then dressed with as much care as is wont&#xD;
to be bestowed upon a new-born babe.&#xD;
In the afternoon, all hands were wide awake. The day&#xD;
still continued very beautiful. With the exception of here&#xD;
and there a tuft of fleecy cloud floating in the soft azure, the&#xD;
heavens were entirely serene. A dove-like gentleness seemed&#xD;
to sit upon the placid bosom of the ocean. The sun gushed&#xD;
forth his exhaustless beams, filling the air with a subdued, but&#xD;
genial splendor.&#xD;
The decks and cabin having been scrubbed, wore a sweet&#xD;
face of cheerfulness. The crew cleaned, personally, and&#xD;
dressed in their tidiest, looked pleasanter, and felt nobler.&#xD;
Indeed, they were filled with that delightful complacency,&#xD;
that accompanies an appeased stomach, a peaceful conscience,&#xD;
and a bright, lovely day.&#xD;

&#xD;
that fervent sect, the Methodist, and who themselves were&#xD;
religious to superstition, drew forth their begriinmed psalm-&#xD;
books, and commenced pitching their vocal pipes. True, their&#xD;
voices chorded but indifferently, yet, accompanied as they&#xD;
were by several others of the crew, who chimed in with a&#xD;
monotonous diapason, the singing had at least the quality of&#xD;
volume ; and as the rough but tender cadences died away&#xD;
upon the ear, they failed- not to awaken some of the purest&#xD;
and dearest associations of home.&#xD;
Sabbath upon the ocean! How joyful the day ! Upon&#xD;
every vocation, this glorious Christian boon falls with seasona-&#xD;
ble grace, but to the wayfaring mariner, tossed upon the cease-&#xD;
less billow, it comes an unspeakable blessing. -&#xD;
To the weary, plodding fisherman, especially, it is truly a&#xD;
day of rest, - a day of sweet refreshing,-- a season for calm,&#xD;
holy enjoyment. Floating so helplessly upon the boundless&#xD;
waste of waters, and surrounded by the mazy sublime scenery&#xD;
of ocean, are circumstances well calculated deeply to impress&#xD;
his open, susceptible nature, and touch with liveliness the&#xD;
mysteries of his divine faith.&#xD;
Ocean ! thou grand type of the glorious Infinite ! -mighty,&#xD;
illimitable, unsearchable ! What thought can compass thy&#xD;
boundless attributes, what expression body thy marvellous as-&#xD;
pects ! Now, grand, majestic, sublime; now, placid, lovely,&#xD;
beautiful. At one time, bold and terrific as a fierce war-&#xD;
charger ; at another,.sweet and tender as a sighing maiden !&#xD;
How fit an emblem is thy ever restless bosom, of the unsatis-&#xD;
fying nature of man ! Thy ever-changing scenery, how&#xD;
strikingly it typifies the unstable in human life ! How pro-&#xD;
foundly thy deep, unexplored caverns appeal to the imagina-&#xD;
tion, suggesting, with awe, the mysterious in the fate of man,&#xD;
and the dark, uncertain future whither he is hastening. Yet,&#xD;
in all thy fitful moods, thou art ever noble, grand old ocean,&#xD;
&#xD;
lifting the soul above earthly grovelling, and inspiring it with&#xD;
lofty.views, and generous aims.&#xD;
As for Walter, so changed, so renovated was now the&#xD;
aspect of every thing around him, contrasted with but a day&#xD;
before, that, looking at life through his feelings, he would&#xD;
scarcely have believed himself on board the same craft, and&#xD;
among the same fellow-beings as formerly.&#xD;
It is doubtless this variety, which lends that peculiar fasci-&#xD;
nation so wonderful to a sea life; a fascination that binds with&#xD;
a spell all-powerful the feet of the hardy wanderer to the&#xD;
severe vicissitudes of the trackless main.&#xD;
There is this difference between the condition of the lowly,&#xD;
and that of the offspring of fortune, that while the honied, velvet&#xD;
life of the latter soon palls upon the sense, and no change can&#xD;
bring richer delight than he has already enjoyed, but may bring&#xD;
disgust rather ; to the former, the merest change is a -hap-&#xD;
py improvement, and is naturally accompanied by that fresh&#xD;
complacency of feeling so conducive to happiness. That is,&#xD;
when we are once used to the harder lot, we glide into the&#xD;
easier with joyous feelings ; but if the easier lot be ours at&#xD;
first, we fall to the harder with a cloud of dejectioh lowering&#xD;
around our path-way. Hence, it is better to commence the&#xD;
ladder of life at the lower round, and make our way up by&#xD;
gradual but firm steppings, when each pace upwards brings&#xD;
us to a broader horizon, and sweeter atmosphere, than to be-&#xD;
gin life at the top-round of the ladder, which can know no&#xD;
higher enjoyment, and if forced down by the unrelenting hand&#xD;
of fortune, must fall to a depressing level of disquietude.&#xD;
They fished away in the spot where they now were, with&#xD;
unflagging activity, buoyed up from the depression of weari-&#xD;
someness, by that elixir of a fishing crew, namely, the hope&#xD;
of full fare and a quick return. But the deck getting cum-&#xD;
bered with gurry, it became necessary to throw it overboard,&#xD;
and change their fishing-ground.&#xD;

&#xD;
Heaving the anchor a-peak, they found it fast to the bottom;&#xD;
and no purchase which they could bring to bear proved ade-&#xD;
quate to weigh it. ' After their best endeavors, they were&#xD;
obliged to cut cable, and leave this part of their ground-&#xD;
tackle behind them.&#xD;
There was now remaining to them but the sheet-anchor,&#xD;
and they deemed it hardly prudent to drop this, lest in the&#xD;
event of losing it, they would be left in the situation most&#xD;
dreaded of all by seamen, namely, at sea without anchors.&#xD;
The opinion now seemed to prevail that they should return&#xD;
home.   True, they might continue on the ground, fishing&#xD;
adrift; and as it was in the gala of the season, and their salt&#xD;
was far from being all wet, this would seem to have been the&#xD;
more reasonable course. Yet no one on board even suggested&#xD;
such a thing. Each one, on the contrary, seemed to fear that&#xD;
something of the kind would be proposed. They had been&#xD;
absent just long enough for that longing sentiment after&#xD;
home, so honorable to our better nature, to have risen to its&#xD;
culmination, and the slightest pretext for turning their face&#xD;
homeward, they seized with the avidity of famishing men.&#xD;
A simple life, with but few objects to direct the current of&#xD;
the affections, seems to increase their depth and strength, just&#xD;
as a stream delves its way all the deeper, as the banks within&#xD;
which it is confined grow more and more narrow.&#xD;

CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
"I LOVE that dear old home! my mother lived there&#xD;
her first sweet marriage years, and last sad widowed ones;&#xD;
The sun-light there seems to me brighter far&#xD;

It is my home."&#xD;
MRs. FRANCES K. BUTLER.&#xD;
"CAM, cam,,cam, not air enough stirring to blow away the&#xD;
breath from the nose of a dead chicken, -never shall get&#xD;
home at this rate, never," grumbled with a pathetic tone, Old&#xD;
Loggy, as he drew his unwieldly body out of the gang-way&#xD;
upon deck.&#xD;
"No use in fretting. Wind'11 come in its own good time,"&#xD;
said the skipper, soothingly.&#xD;
" Then heaven speed the day," answered the old fisherman,&#xD;
rather snappishly.  "Come, boy," he continued, addressing&#xD;
Walter, who was standing near him, " can't you whistle us up&#xD;
a breeze ? I'm not much of a hand for such tricks myself.&#xD;
In fact, used to think 'twasn't right,, but I'll go in for any-&#xD;
thing now, that'll push us along."&#xD;
" Tut, tut," broke forth the skipper, "I never knew any&#xD;
good to come from whistling on board a vessel, especially&#xD;
whistling to get a breeze. On the contrary, I've seen it fol-&#xD;
lowed by squalls enough to- take the very spars out of the&#xD;
vessel. Shouldn't ever tempt the Almighty."&#xD;

&#xD;
In truth, their patience had been greatly put to the test, by&#xD;
a tedious succession of light, baffling head winds, creeping&#xD;
lazily ever from one point of the heavens -namely, the&#xD;
south-west. Their progress all this time was, in the nomen-&#xD;
clature of Marl, but a snail's gallop.&#xD;
At long intervals, however, the feeble breath of wind, after&#xD;
-     sporting cruelly with their intense longing for a change, would&#xD;
wane and wane, until it completely gasped out, leaving a day&#xD;
or two of flat burning calm. A slight breeze would then&#xD;
spring up from the east, accompanied by an ominous thicken-.&#xD;
ing up in the sky. This would soon gradually veer around to&#xD;
the south-east, freshen, while the entire canopy of the heavens&#xD;
would undergo all the magic wonders of the kaleidoscope.&#xD;
The vessel would now plough her way, as if eager to im-&#xD;
prove the moment; and the crew walking briskly the deck,&#xD;
under the electric thrill of rapid motion, and the charm of re-&#xD;
vived hopes, could not but be in the most happy state of mind-&#xD;
possible. But in a little while, the rain would strike in, and.&#xD;
presently pour down in torrents. Then would come the&#xD;
"stumps " as they were called, heard at the bow, indicating a&#xD;
change of wind, which was sure soon to follow, whipping in to&#xD;
the north-west, and after making a little feint here at blowing,&#xD;
would veer back to the south-west, and settle down at its old&#xD;
tune.&#xD;
But for these free flaws, the goal, it seemed, would never&#xD;
be reached. And as it was, the distance between them and&#xD;
home, looked to the eye of feeling of interminable length, and&#xD;
the time rolled back and loomed up in the mirage of dejection&#xD;
as a space never to be spanned.&#xD;
For a week after leaving the fishing-ground, the time, night&#xD;
and day, was about all consumed in eating and sleeping.&#xD;
Jaded nature now made sweet amends for past neglect.&#xD;
The physical satiated, several of the more ingenious took to&#xD;
&#xD;
haberdashing in order to kill time. Fishall cut out with his&#xD;
knife a very pretty hull of a schooner. Marl busied himself&#xD;
upon a curious ivory box, the materials of which he had got&#xD;
on a previous voyage whaling.- While the skipper - and&#xD;
shall we say it - was absorbed in the setting together in the&#xD;
most fantastic manner, the patch-work of a quilt. No curious&#xD;
lady's fingers-could have shown greater delicacy or skill.&#xD;
This timely occupation was enlivened by each one's run-&#xD;
ning off his stock on hand of old stories. By the time they&#xD;
had got round, these would bear repeating. Then came a&#xD;
string of old stories revamped. Bits of personal experience&#xD;
followed, threads of early life -scenes of love, courtship, mar-&#xD;
riage, in which Imagination, good, dear Divinity, helped&#xD;
amazingly to embellish the text.&#xD;
This resource exhausted, there settled around them a season&#xD;
of dread melancholy, filled with sullen looks, snappish tones and&#xD;
ugly ways. It was that dire sea-curse which comes so strangely&#xD;
like a deep unsettling cloud to drive far away the sweet amen-&#xD;
ities of social life, making the faces even of boon comrades to&#xD;
look hateful.&#xD;
This blank monotony was, however, occasionally relieved&#xD;
by some godsend of an incident, or perhaps, by a general&#xD;
discussion upon a chapter of the ways in early times.-&#xD;
For example, at a remark of Walter, about the badness of&#xD;
their diet, which had been of, late rapidly growing worse and&#xD;
worse, as the cook shared the general langor and dejection,&#xD;
old Loggy took up the thread of talk in his own peculiar&#xD;
vein.&#xD;
" Ah, my boy," quoth the veteran fisherman, "you know&#xD;
nothing of the hardships of fishing, as it used to be when I was&#xD;
a boy. When eleven years old, I went cook of a low decked&#xD;
banker, for sixteen men, all regular salamanders for eating.&#xD;
" Hard times of it, I'll be bound," remarked Fishall.&#xD;
&#xD;
HARD FARE.              203&#xD;

THE FISHER BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Well, it kept me pretty busy, but boys worked in them&#xD;
days. But then it must be owned, that we didn't have so&#xD;
many nice fixings in with the bill of fare, as they do now-a-&#xD;
days. 'Twas plain sailing after all.  Brown bread, hasty&#xD;
pudding, squeal, stifled fish heads and beans, were the princi-&#xD;
pal things. Pork and molasses were extras. About these&#xD;
latter, some would eat theirs as they went along, but most&#xD;
strung up their share of pork, and poured their molasses into&#xD;
a jug, to take home for their families in the winter. Fish and&#xD;
potatoes with pork fat, was called fish and dip ; without the&#xD;
pork, it wasfish and pint, that is, to eat the fish and potatoes&#xD;
and point at, or think of the pork. Doughboys, were some-&#xD;
times boiled with the fish and potatoes. A few would eat&#xD;
these hot with their pork and molasses, but most of the crew&#xD;
strung up theirs to take home. In them times fishermen&#xD;
thought they couldn't afford to eat the bodies of the fishes&#xD;
they caught, but were content with the heads and back-bones,&#xD;
and good eating are they too. They used to save all the&#xD;
tongues and sounds of their codfish, all the fins, skinnet and&#xD;
junket of their halibut to buy vegetables with in the fall, at&#xD;
market."&#xD;
" They lived so saving in olden times, that I should think&#xD;
everybody would have got rich," observed Fishall.&#xD;
Yes, owners and skippers did use to get ahead, but us&#xD;
poor hands had a hard-time of it," continued Loggy. " First,&#xD;
we had to fit out in Boston. The fitters put aboard such&#xD;
stores as they liked, and charged what prices they thought&#xD;
best ; then put on 6 per cent for six months, or 12 per cent&#xD;
per year, giving the skipper, perhaps, an extra demijohn or&#xD;
so, to pull the wool over his- eyes. When they came to settle&#xD;
the voyage in the fall, the skipper must first have his sixty-&#xD;
fourth, the owners a quarter for the vessel, and an eighth for&#xD;
making the fish. Then taking out the great generals, the&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
small generals, what each had had out for himself, and for his&#xD;
family, there would be precious little left for the family to&#xD;
live on, after paying up doctors' bills, store-bills, and giving&#xD;
the gals each a new suit, and the boys a few dollars for spend-&#xD;
ing money for frolics and weddings; for we used to have a&#xD;
good many mouths to feed in them days. Poor father and&#xD;
mother had twenty four children, and I and Jemimah, by the&#xD;
blessing of heaven, have given the light to eighteen ; but poor&#xD;
us, we 've got most through this empty world."&#xD;
At this moment, the cry of "porpoises " was heard. Every&#xD;
man below sprang upon deck, and rushed forward, as if&#xD;
pressed on with a fury. And the skipper foremost of all&#xD;
seized the harpoon, that was lying upon the windlass ready&#xD;
bent to a coil of rope, leaped into the bow-sprit rigging, and&#xD;
poised the weapon for a throw. The vessel, at the time,&#xD;
was running quickly with a fresh breeze .upon the quarter.&#xD;
The shoals of porpoises seemed in the merriest glee. Tak-&#xD;
ing, doubtless, the hulk of the vessel for a huge whale, they&#xD;
appeared to vie with each other in sportive pranks about his&#xD;
body. Down they would come on the quarter, cutting the&#xD;
water with the keenest zest, and after reaching the bow, dart&#xD;
across the forefoot, as if for very fun.&#xD;
At length, after aiming awhile in indecision, the skipper let&#xD;
fly, and had the good luck to peirce a large one through and&#xD;
through. Athletic hands seized the rope attached to the har-&#xD;
poon, and, in a trice, the bleeding animal of the deep, writhing&#xD;
in the agony of death, was roused up to the cat-head, and&#xD;
pulled in upon deck. But the companions of the captured&#xD;
fish, as if imbued with the instinct of humanity, all disap-&#xD;
peared at once, seeming to shrink in horror in view of the&#xD;
barbarity of the deed.&#xD;
The porpoise proved a plump one, and cutting off the&#xD;
blubber, and trying it out for oil, the muscle resembling that&#xD;

of the ox, was kept for the table, and a dainty morsel it was,&#xD;
after so long fast from fresh provisions.&#xD;
This incident served as food both for body and mind. The&#xD;
moody incrustation that had grown around them, like a mossy&#xD;
shell, appeared broken, and sociality was revived.&#xD;
One morning, after a most satisfying meal of porpoise, a&#xD;
conversation sprang up, which became very lively and ear-&#xD;
nest.~&#xD;
" After all said," summed up Fishall, "fishing is a mean&#xD;
business. 'Tis a real dog's life to lead. Everybody looks&#xD;
upon it as a despised calling. It is a curse to our place. No-&#xD;
body that follows fishing, ever arrives to anything, and I am&#xD;
going to get out of it as soon as possible. What say you, Mr.&#xD;
Marl?"&#xD;
" Well," replied the Salt, with a thoughtful look, and with&#xD;
a tone of more than usual frankness, "To confess, I once had&#xD;
a prejudice against the calling, but a wider experience in life,&#xD;
has changed somewhat my early notions. I have now come&#xD;
to regard any pursuit honorable, that is honest. 'Tis the man&#xD;
that gives character to the calling, and not the calling that&#xD;
imparts- dignity to the man. As Dr. Young justly says:&#xD;
"Pigmies are pigmies still, though perched on Alps,&#xD;
And pyramids are pyramids in vales."&#xD;
"Agriculture was considered menial among the ancients, yet&#xD;
Cincinnatus was called from the plough to lead the- Roman&#xD;
armies, and few men have been more truly honored by their&#xD;
country.&#xD;
"If fishing has been looked upon as low and mean, it is be-&#xD;
cause low and ignorant people have for the most part, been&#xD;
engaged in it. Let the business be taken up by men of intel-&#xD;
ligence, enterprise and high social position, and the sentiment&#xD;
in respect to it would change at once. This is evident from&#xD;
&#xD;
THE FISHING BUSINESS.             207&#xD;
&#xD;
the fact that gentlemen of the highest pretensions feel it a&#xD;
privilege to catch fish for sport. Now, what is beautiful as&#xD;
amusement, cannot be degrading as an occupation.&#xD;
" Indeed, so far from being a debasing employment, it may be&#xD;
looked upon, in comparison with many other ways men resort&#xD;
to, to eke out a livelihood, a glorious avocation. No one can fail&#xD;
to perceive, for example, that hauling codfish from the deep,&#xD;
is in itself quite as noble as peddling wooden nutmegs, or&#xD;
even measuring tape behind a counter. There are some&#xD;
kinds of business ashore whose very littleness belittles the&#xD;
mind. There are many others which are so mixed up with&#xD;
deception, slander, and overreaching, that one cannot engage&#xD;
in them earnestly without imbibing more or less of these hate-&#xD;
ful qualities himself. Now fishing is free from all these influ-&#xD;
ences, and is singularly calculated to keep the mind pure and&#xD;
simple, and the feelings chaste, warm and generous.&#xD;
"In this respect fishing may be classed side by side with&#xD;
agriculture, two of the most honest and noble occupations of&#xD;
life. One reaping riches from the bounteous earth, the other&#xD;
drawing them from the exhaustless ocean, and both contribut-&#xD;
ing to the wealth of the country and the happiness and wel-&#xD;
fare of man.&#xD;
"It must be confessed, that the fishing business admits of&#xD;
very great improvement ; and when we consider the inestima-&#xD;
ble value of fish as an article of food, and consider. the bound-&#xD;
less regions, the domain of the miriads of the finny tribes, to-&#xD;
gether with the marvellous fruitfulness of the species, it be-&#xD;
comes, at once apparent how desirable are any means that&#xD;
shall look to the amelioration of the condition of the fisher-&#xD;
man, and add to the lucrativeness of his craft.&#xD;
" Though fishing has been greatly abused," continued Marl,&#xD;
"yet a good deal can be said in its favor. It is certainly a&#xD;
very healthful occupation, and this is no small item in the bill&#xD;

of human welfare. It has justly been regarded as a nursery&#xD;
for staunch and able seamen. In the trying scenes of the&#xD;
late war with England, not a few of the bold hearts and de-&#xD;
fiant arms that successfully repulsed the foe, and protected our&#xD;
sea-board sprang from the ranks of the fishermen. And at&#xD;
this day, a goodly proportion of those noble commanders that&#xD;
at once honor and grace our marine, commenced their career&#xD;
as fishing boys.&#xD;
"More even, I could point you here and there, all over the&#xD;
land, to many a gentleman living ashore in affluence, and&#xD;
adorning every profession in life, who commenced the world&#xD;
on board a fishing schooner.&#xD;
"The chronicles of the past, tell us that many of the splendid&#xD;
cities of the world, among them London, Paris, and Havre do&#xD;
Grace, were once obscure fishing towns ; and so strikingly&#xD;
was this true of Amsterdam, as to give rise to the remark,&#xD;
that that city was built upon fish-bones.&#xD;
" And greater than all, and what should cover the humble&#xD;
vocation of fishing with everlasting honor, is, that Christ, our&#xD;
blessed Saviour and guide, chose for his disciples and bosom&#xD;
companions, who were to promulgate to the world, and to suc-&#xD;
ceeding generations, the immortal truths of the New Testa-&#xD;
ment, the despised fishermen of Galilee.&#xD;
"The deplorable truth is, we are ever getting our heads&#xD;
turned and our souls corrupted, by suffering the longing eye&#xD;
to hanker after the dazzling unrealities of life. We wander&#xD;
like the prodigal son from the hearth-stone of simple nature,&#xD;
and become badly intoxicated over the drugged wines of Fal-&#xD;
sity. The unsophisticated youth, for instance, peers out&#xD;
through the loop-hole of his narrow existence, and the big&#xD;
world swells upon his vision like some splendid city flashing&#xD;
in the golden sun rays, but on entering this city's crowded&#xD;
precincts, he is sickened with the view of narrow, dirty streets&#xD;
&#xD;
and squalid misery staring him on every side, and on looking&#xD;
deeper, is shocked with great blotches of pollution, like dark&#xD;
running sores upon the body.&#xD;
"And when he gazes at society, dear, divine.society, with its&#xD;
rustling silks, superb equipage, soft, complacent airs, he is&#xD;
quite fascinated. He feels to despise his rustic lot, and sighs&#xD;
for the golden bauble of his vision ; but when permitted to&#xD;
grasp the flashing meteor, how astounded is he to find it little&#xD;
more than empty show and hollow pretension !&#xD;
a It has been my fortune," he continued, "to see much of the&#xD;
world, to mingle intimately with all classes, and I have found&#xD;
the good and the bad, the noble and the ignoble, the refined&#xD;
and the vile, in every condition; and I have as often met&#xD;
with refinement of feeling, sympathy of heart, and real man-&#xD;
hood, among the lower as among the higher classes, so&#xD;
called.&#xD;
"But there is after all a real society upon earth, made up&#xD;
like the great Catholic Church, of kindred natures, of con-&#xD;
genial spirits, of such as are drawn to each other by the chords&#xD;
of mutual love and esteem.&#xD;
"What is needed in the world is more honesty of purpose,&#xD;
more independence of character, more genuine sympathy with&#xD;
the good, the natural, the meritorious. Each should be more&#xD;
true to his own noble instincts, should rise superior to the&#xD;
prejudices of society, should assert the dignity of human na-&#xD;
ture everywhere, should magnify the immortal manhood&#xD;
within him. For what are all the factitious distinctions of life&#xD;
compared with the possession of the fresh, vigorous pulse of&#xD;
nature beating within us.&#xD;
" Well, how hard we strive after happiness, when the cov-&#xD;
eted boon is so nearly within our grasp. A peaceful con-&#xD;
science, congenial employment,-and if to these be added a&#xD;
few, a very few friends -yea, a single real heart-entwined&#xD;

&#xD;
friend, with a healthful love for the exhaustless glories of na-&#xD;
ture, art and literature, - and little more is wanting to coin-&#xD;
plete our little paradise upon earth."&#xD;
At this conclusion of the veteran sailor, the crew remained&#xD;
for a time thoughtfully silent, while Walter felt a, strange&#xD;
momentary sensation of despondency in contemplating what&#xD;
went so effectually to shiver his own bright vision of the&#xD;
future.&#xD;
Meanwhile, their reckoning was so nearly up, that expecta-&#xD;
tion on board stood a tiptoe looking out for land. None but&#xD;
such as may have experienced it, can picture the mortal im-&#xD;
patience, felt at sea for the first sight of land, and especially,&#xD;
if that land be home. They looked and looked, straining&#xD;
their longing vision, until Hope seemed cruelly sporting with&#xD;
their fond anticipations.&#xD;
' At length, glorious vision ! it appears. A propitious&#xD;
breeze wafts them joyously toward the grateful shores. The&#xD;
steadfast point beaming with a smile of welcome is rounded.&#xD;
The lovely waters of the Bay are fleetly crossed. Now&#xD;
comes the painful suspense, before the first flash of news.&#xD;
Are all their friends alive and well, or has, casualty, disease&#xD;
or death been stealing its insidious foot among them, in their&#xD;
absence? A man approached on the beach.&#xD;
"What of the news."&#xD;
"All are well."&#xD;
Their hearts beat in a tumult of joy at the sweet tidings.&#xD;
As Walter sprang upon the beach, the soft, fragrant wood-&#xD;
land air fell upon his sense, with the keenest charm of delight,&#xD;
so bright and soothing was the green verdure upon the mel-&#xD;
low landscape before him. This was the outward of that&#xD;
inner and deeper sentiment with which anticipation had col-&#xD;
ored the heart.&#xD;
But as he wended homeward, he felt 'strange at the awk-&#xD;
&#xD;
I'&#xD;
&#xD;
wardness of his own gait. The ground seemed unsteady&#xD;
beneath his tread. In fact he rolled and pitched, as if still&#xD;
aboard the capricious Pink; and he noticed the rest had a&#xD;
similar, ungainly walk.&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
"Let me live amongst high thoughts, and smiles&#xD;
As beautiful as love; with grasping hands,&#xD;
And a heart that flutters with diviner life&#xD;
Whene'er my step is heard."&#xD;
PRoCTon's MIRAmDOLA.&#xD;
IT was now a joyous season at the Mansion. Walter's re-&#xD;
turn had ushered in a wave of sunshine upon the parental&#xD;
roof. Grandmother, uncles, aunts, relatives, and neighbors,&#xD;
all were filled with gladsomeness, and rushed around the boy&#xD;
to express their congratulations, and heart-felt sympathy.&#xD;
Oh the happiness of a cordial welcome, from warm, sympa-&#xD;
thetic hearts ! It seemed to Walter to compensate for all the&#xD;
hardships he had undergone. As for Mrs. Carl, her joy and&#xD;
gratitude knew no bounds. It nearly took away the power&#xD;
of expression.&#xD;
The Pink had been absent eight weeks, during which no&#xD;
tidings had been heard of her. They intended on leaving to&#xD;
be gone but a few days, and this unaccountable absence filled&#xD;
the friends at home, as well it might, with the most intense&#xD;
solicitude, and apprehension. All sorts of conjectures were&#xD;
framed as to the probable fate of the Pink, and even the most&#xD;
prudent and slowest of belief, shook their heads and looked&#xD;
serious when called upon for an opinion. They were then&#xD;
like friends risen from the dead.&#xD;
(212)&#xD;
&#xD;
The following morning dawned brightly for the inevitable&#xD;
washing-out-day. Basking so delightfully amid the sweet&#xD;
charms of home, Walter would gladly have excused himself&#xD;
from the drudgery of washing-out, but his generous nature&#xD;
recoiled at the thought of shirking his share of duty with the&#xD;
rest.&#xD;
On reaching the beach, he found most of the crew down&#xD;
there before him, briskly at work. They were garbed in a&#xD;
clean suit from head to foot, and their countenances were&#xD;
wreathed with an expression of radiant complaisance.&#xD;
A scow was along side -of the Pink, into which the fishes&#xD;
were being pitched from the hold of the vessel, and they were&#xD;
flying through the air, as if hurled by the spring of gladness.&#xD;
When loaded, the scow was slowly pulled ashore, and her&#xD;
burden tumbled into the edge of the water, or surf. Here a&#xD;
part of the crew stationed. themselves, and each in a stooping&#xD;
posture, seizing a fish by the tail in either hand, and after&#xD;
scrubbing them together and washing and rinsing them until&#xD;
clean, added another and another, until the hands being full,&#xD;
he trudged them up the rising beach, and deposited them&#xD;
upon a rectangular pile, or stack, termed Waterhorse. Here&#xD;
the fishes remained a day or two, until the surplus water had&#xD;
become duly pressed from them, when they were carted by&#xD;
the shoresman, and spread upon the flakes for drying.&#xD;
This washing-out was wearisome enough to Walter, but&#xD;
then he was standing upon his native shore, and the labor of&#xD;
the day once over, he could-nestle ,till the morrow, amid the&#xD;
dear delights of home. Then the irksomeness of washing-out&#xD;
was relieved by the notable washing-out dinner. This was a&#xD;
bright spot in the fishing life, - an event looked forward to&#xD;
with keen anticipation, a pleasure beforehand that helped to&#xD;
dissipate many a weary day at sea.&#xD;
It was given by the owners who were also shoresmen, as a&#xD;

&#xD;
bonus to the crew for privileges received in return, and&#xD;
doubtless originated from the well known principle of human&#xD;
nature, that when the stomach is once appeased, the other&#xD;
powers'of the man yield a ready acquiescence.&#xD;
The washing-out dinner in the simple life -of the fisherman&#xD;
was an event of more real lively importance, than the most&#xD;
sumptuous banquet in society. The preparations for it were&#xD;
little less extensive, and the circumstances with which it was&#xD;
invested, were not of much less eclat than those accompany-&#xD;
ing an old fashioned family wedding.&#xD;
First, the neighborhood had to be scoured for the nicest&#xD;
pig, calf, lamb, or poultry; and this in a part of the country,&#xD;
and, at a time, when fresh meat was a rare and expensive&#xD;
luxury. Added to these were the puddings, pies, custards,&#xD;
and other forms of pastry, prepared by the good matrons of&#xD;
the day, who prided themselves, without vain pretension, upon&#xD;
excellent cookery.&#xD;
This substantial and not altogether not luxurious board,&#xD;
was heightened immensely in charm, by the fast from shore-&#xD;
diet at sea, and the waste of the system, by a long forenoon's&#xD;
washing-out. Well might it be looked forward to, with a&#xD;
covetous, longing eye.&#xD;
And thrice joyful was the moment, when the long.polished&#xD;
table, stretched in the most capacious room, with floor well&#xD;
scoured and sanded, displaying in unstinted abundance the&#xD;
glowing savory viands to tempt the eager appetite. Around&#xD;
it ranged with alacrity the crew, with a sprinkling of the&#xD;
shoresmen.  Their manner was pervaded by a kind of&#xD;
hearty and hale frankness, but mincing ceremony was no&#xD;
more seen among them, than if such a thing did not exist in&#xD;
the world. Yet there was apparent a kind of deferential re-&#xD;
spect, and, among the younger of the crew, a species of be-&#xD;
coming modesty, or bashfulness, that invested the scene with&#xD;
&#xD;
a certain air of restraint. Still, there were abundant evi-&#xD;
dences of genial good humor playing up in the countenances&#xD;
of all, and not unfrequently there would break forth a laconic&#xD;
remark, or a dry joke, that enkindled the company and en-&#xD;
livened the repast.&#xD;
Not the least charming features of the scene were the&#xD;
bloomed matrons and the blooming maidens, who like&#xD;
freighted blessings with angel wings, were quick and ready in&#xD;
their attendance upon the-company. It was no menial grudg-&#xD;
ing service that they rendered, but that sweet happy bestowal&#xD;
from united hands and loving hearts.&#xD;
The former mildly clad, with countenance beaming with&#xD;
gratitude and happiness. The latter simply garbed, but in&#xD;
their tidiest and prettiest, with bosom swelling with hope,&#xD;
eye melting with tenderness, and cheek crimsoning with mod-&#xD;
esty.&#xD;
To the pure, impressionable soul of youth, what object so&#xD;
inspiring of delicious emotions, as the contemplation of a&#xD;
beautiful maiden, reared amid the sweet simplicities of na-&#xD;
ture. Swelling like a soft, bursting rose-bud, with the inimi-&#xD;
table charms of Nature and her sex, -just standing upon the&#xD;
-mysterious threshold of womanhood, she appears as.uncon-&#xD;
scious of her deep loveliness, as the woodland bird of its&#xD;
matchless note, or the gay butterfly of the inimitable hue of&#xD;
its wings.&#xD;
Ah, hapless man, couldst thou arrest from the inexorable&#xD;
ravishings of Time, and the heartless corruptions of the world,&#xD;
so divine, but fugitive charms ; couldst thou fold the embodied&#xD;
joy forever to thy own needful, yearning heart; nestle there&#xD;
rapturously amid the soft palpitations of its virginal bosom;&#xD;
and drink in endlessly from the love incense of its fragrant&#xD;
breath, what a fount of perennial happiness would not be&#xD;
thine ! How then to thy inner sense would this earth blos-&#xD;

THE FISHER BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
son like a beautiful garden ; its radiant heavens beam with&#xD;
the prismatic hues of the rainbow; and life all around' hang&#xD;
thickly with the golden fruit of human blessedness. This one&#xD;
need of thy nature fulfilled, -the fine germ of thy soul thus&#xD;
enveloped in the- native beauty of a kindred existence, how&#xD;
would thy new life shoot up afresh from the darkness of chaos&#xD;
and blossom like a rose. What a heaven of heavens would it&#xD;
hang around thy perpetual view. How it would nerve thy.&#xD;
arm valorously for the stern battle of Life.&#xD;
Alas, that such a picture can rarely exist, except in tie&#xD;
longing dream of the heart. Alas, that the wine of life must&#xD;
be so often spilled ; that dawning innocence should ever&#xD;
awake to a night of shame ; that the perceptions of moral&#xD;
beauty should ever be perverted by the corrupting influences&#xD;
of society, that the dearest and loveliest attributes of the soul,&#xD;
should ever be bartered for sordid gain; and that life should'&#xD;
sink into a grovelling existence destitute alike of noble aim or&#xD;
spiritual beauty.&#xD;
The washing-out done by the crew, the making or drying&#xD;
of the fish, was the part of the shoresman and his gang.&#xD;
From the water-horse, the fishes were carted, and spread for&#xD;
drying upon platforms entwined with twigs, called flakes or&#xD;
hurdles, situated in the most favorable spot to woo the breeze&#xD;
and sun. As the evening dew began to fall, or upon the ap-&#xD;
proach of wet weather, the fishes were gathered in yaffles, but&#xD;
spread again whenever circumstances appeared favorable for&#xD;
drying. This process repeated a few days, they were ready&#xD;
to be packed into larger stacks for a smoother face, when of a&#xD;
fine drying day, they were thrown out for a final airing, they&#xD;
were either weighed off and despatched on board a vessel to&#xD;
market, or else stored for a more deliberate sale, according to&#xD;
circumstances.&#xD;
Washing-out over, and the vessel thoroughly cleared out,&#xD;
&#xD;
F'&#xD;
&#xD;
washed and scrubbed, there were a few days leisure to the ves-&#xD;
sel's company, before setting out upon the Mackerel Voyage.&#xD;
The married portion of the crew, and some of the more sedate&#xD;
of the bachelors, employed the interval in doing up the neg-&#xD;
lected home chores. But the youngsters were only too happy&#xD;
in the opportunity it afforded them, to appear trigged in their&#xD;
gayest attire, and saunter full-bloomed, all redolent with the&#xD;
perfume of their own fresh feelings, amid the welcome neigh-&#xD;
borhood. It was altogether natural that some of these latter&#xD;
should often of a fine afternoon, find themselves straying off&#xD;
toward the Fishing Flakes, attracted thither by the young&#xD;
damsels so busy there, garbed in short skirts, gloves, armlets,&#xD;
and sun-bonnets, lustily engaged in the general work. For&#xD;
in those days, the practice prevailed among the fishermen of&#xD;
employing young women to help at the flakes, whose efficient&#xD;
services could be secured for a trivial pecuniary consideration.&#xD;
Not unfrequently the wives and daughters of the crew, skip-&#xD;
per and shoresman, and even of the owners .themselves, did&#xD;
not feel too good to lend a helping hand. Indeed, oftentimes,&#xD;
some fair young daughter, the pride of the neighborhood,&#xD;
whose father, it may be, in solid wealth, could outweigh a&#xD;
score of some of your puny city misses, too delicate to look a&#xD;
rough North-wester full in the face, might have been seen&#xD;
among the number.&#xD;
Without meddling with the vexed question of woman's&#xD;
rights, one thing is certain, that these simple young women&#xD;
of olden time, who never felt too good to labor with their&#xD;
hands, were never above the calling of their parents, who&#xD;
were always ready to assist in earning the money intended for&#xD;
their comfort and happiness in life,--in all the cardinal qual-&#xD;
ities of character grew up very excellent women--affection-&#xD;
ate wives, good mothers, kind neigh' rs, and exemplary Chris-&#xD;
tians.&#xD;

Undoubtedly pursuit and association have their influence in&#xD;
the formation of female character, but the power of these is&#xD;
not radical, when, the primitive elements are kept within the&#xD;
fountain of simplicity and truth. Else, how is it, that we so&#xD;
often meet with some fair flower of character, all fragrant with&#xD;
the grace and loveliness of nature, that has grown up amid&#xD;
the grosser associations of life, while we as often see another&#xD;
frail being cradled in the lap of luxury and boasted refine-&#xD;

Yet is the school-house rude,&#xD;
As is the chrysalis to the butterfly,-&#xD;

STREET'S Poaas&#xD;
THE fishing season was over. The first summer's experi-&#xD;
ence in Walter's sea life, was now numbered with the fleeting&#xD;
moments of the past. Its hardships and checkered incident&#xD;
had broadened life's horizon to the boy, and imparted to him&#xD;
greater depth; of character.&#xD;
The mackerel voyage in the fall, which we have not here&#xD;
room to describe, being over, and the vessel hauled up for the&#xD;
season, Walter stood in his winter suit of new cloth, some-&#xD;
what more of a man in stature, and greatly more in a compla-&#xD;
cent feeling of. self-importance. He had achieved something,&#xD;
or, at least, had experienced a real grappling with life, and&#xD;
the consciousness of this lit up his imagination soothingly, and&#xD;
gave a sweet glow to hope. It sent the blood throbbing with&#xD;
keener. vigor through his pulse, and imparted a more lively&#xD;
elasticity to his step.&#xD;
There is something nobly charming in the first pulsations&#xD;
of successful achievement. The delight it awakens is scarcely&#xD;
less sweet than the blissful dream of love. The incipient&#xD;
power seizes the ardent and aspiring soul of youth, kindling&#xD;

&#xD;
and glowing into a passion for generous and manly effort,&#xD;
casting outward its piercing beams, and lighting up a bright&#xD;
vista of the future, vague and dreamy, but grand and fascinat-&#xD;
ing. The intoxicated youth feels suddenly endowed with an&#xD;
illimitable capacity. Great and noble deeds lie golden in his&#xD;
path-way; his heart distends with its own generous emotion,&#xD;
and yearns to press to its warm embrace the whole living&#xD;
world. His soul soars to the loftiest flights, seeking some&#xD;
career of grandeur that shall crownhis footsteps with immor-&#xD;
tal honors.&#xD;
This feeling sobers' with age, and is dulled by the realities&#xD;
ahid disappointments of life, but it never becomes extinct ; .&#xD;
not at least, so long as there is vitality in the heart, vigor ini&#xD;
the step, and activity in the muscle. It, is, in fact, the birth&#xD;
of action, living with its life, and dying with its death. Thus,&#xD;
we perceive, it is the getting, and not the possessing of wealth&#xD;
that keeps the soul full of the enjoyment of acquisition -- the&#xD;
climbing up the ladder of Fame, and not the serene contem-&#xD;
plation from its summit, that keeps the heart aglow with the&#xD;
sweet enthusiasm  of ambition. 'Tis the moving wing that&#xD;
flashes in the sunlight. Thus, those who look forward con-&#xD;
fidently to a day of complete rest upon earth, a time when all&#xD;
the faculties may remain in a state of inactivity, fall into a&#xD;
dangerous illusion.-&#xD;
Glorious Thanksgivingpast, a day of rare significance in&#xD;
those simple times, and one that gave a bright inauguration to&#xD;
the Winter's- festivities, came the Winter's School. This, by&#xD;
time honored custom must always commence the first Monday&#xD;
after Thanksgiving day. Here assembled for learning, the&#xD;
youths of the neighborhood. High and low, rich and poor,&#xD;
the Abecedarian, and the most advanced of the People's Col-&#xD;

the separation. of the sexes, refined contrivances of the pre-&#xD;
sent knowing age, were out of the question in those primi-&#xD;
tive times. - A neighborhood was but a larger family. Chil-&#xD;
dren played together, grew up with each other, usually at-&#xD;
tended the same church, at least, went to the same school,&#xD;
assembled at one festive board, intermarried according to&#xD;
individual bent, were attended in sickness by neighbors and&#xD;
friends, received genuine sympathy on their death-bed, and&#xD;
were laid in the same graveyard together at the close of life.&#xD;
To be sure, these simple rude societies were not free of the&#xD;
ills that everywhere beset human nature, and fester as people&#xD;
crowd into neighborhoods, but there was ~ in them a cordial,&#xD;
friendly intercourse, a hearty, genuine sympathy, that seems&#xD;
fast dying out upon earth. Oh, that we could invoke the in-&#xD;
cense of the warm heart of the Past.&#xD;
The branches taught in school then, had not widened off to&#xD;
such a range as we find now. There were no learned lan-&#xD;
guages, with their eternal clatter. At most but the simple&#xD;
tough Anglo Saxon, quaintly spoken. No ologies diving into&#xD;
the mysteries of Nature. No ornamentals, save, perhaps, a&#xD;
sample of the marking stitch, or'a humble effort at painting&#xD;
with the cranberry or chokeberry. No singing except an&#xD;
occasional solo from some repentant urchin suffering from the&#xD;
smart of the teacher's ire. The utmost scope, given to the&#xD;
branches taught, were reading, spelling, penmanship, and&#xD;
arithmetic; and even of these, the latter branch was deemed&#xD;
quite useless for females. - The softer sex were thought of&#xD;
hardly sufficient intellectual power to delve successfully into&#xD;
the abstrusities of the mathematics. At any rate, such hard&#xD;
and out of the way knowledge, could not be, it was contended,&#xD;
of any possible use to them. It would not render them more&#xD;
skilful in making bread, or weaving cloth.&#xD;
The master was subjected to no such crucifixion, as exam-&#xD;

ination. No committee of wiseacres sat in umpire over his&#xD;
claims. Our fathers had a simple way of testing. qualifica-&#xD;
tions. The popular apprehension decided first whether an&#xD;
applicant should be admitted to trial. If he then succeeded&#xD;
in conducting acceptably his school, he was reemployed.&#xD;
There was no third party to test fitness.&#xD;
The primary element in a teacher's success, was his&#xD;
power or tact to govern. If he could rule his little king-&#xD;
dom, all was right. Literary qualifications were of minor&#xD;
importance. If he could not govern perfectly, it was all&#xD;
over with him, however competent he might be in other&#xD;
respects.&#xD;
But in his authority, he stood alone, himself on one side,&#xD;
his little army of spirits on the other. Whatever his fate,&#xD;
he received no comfort ,or aid from parents. He must fight&#xD;
his own battles. Indeed, if the parents did not encourage&#xD;
the sly tricks of their little ones to out-wit the school-&#xD;
master, they certainly winked at them, and were inclined&#xD;
to look upon their mischievous pranks as evidence of smart-&#xD;
iless.&#xD;
But then if they did not cooperate with the teacher in&#xD;
maintaining his authority, they never took the part of the&#xD;
child against the teacher. The practice was, if a child had&#xD;
received a whipping at school, to give him another, and send&#xD;
him back for a third.&#xD;
The question of the master's supremacy was usually de-&#xD;
cided in the outset. If the teacher was ejected out of the&#xD;
doorway, or worse, thrown through the window, the first day,&#xD;
and then snowballed until acknowledging himself vanquished,&#xD;
by a combination of the older boys, it were about useless for&#xD;
him to attempt a resumption of his official position, but if by&#xD;
some coup d' etat, or coup de main, he succeeded in getting&#xD;
the reins in his own hands, all was right.&#xD;
&#xD;
Government was too often arbitrary, harsh and impulsive,&#xD;
and punishments often severe, intemperate and cruel.&#xD;
Scholars could hardly be expected to cherish affection for&#xD;
teachers exercising government in so despotic and barbarous&#xD;
a manner, and the most these knights of the rod and ferule&#xD;
could boast of in the way of fealty from their pupils, was a&#xD;
sort of trembling awe. Hence, it was no rare episode among&#xD;
the incidents of the last day of school, for some of the more&#xD;
daring spirits of the little empire, who during the winter, had&#xD;
felt the smart of the teacher's rod oftener than their haughty&#xD;
spirit was disposed to brook, and moved by that inexorable&#xD;
law, "as a man soweth so shall he reap," to overtake the master&#xD;
while this dignitary was on his way home, and come down&#xD;
with a sound drubbing upon his merciless head, and so wipe&#xD;
out the old score.&#xD;
It were pleasing to attempt a picture of the Old District&#xD;
School, that had for so long pursued the even tenor of its way,&#xD;
but limited space bids us hurry on with this narrative of the&#xD;
Fisher Boy. Suffice it to say, that the current of school life,&#xD;
that had flown so evenly in the moss-grown edifice, was soon&#xD;
to receive a check. As we have elsewhere intimated, a spirit&#xD;
of innovation had already begun to dawn in the settlement.&#xD;
It was soon to show itself in the administration of the School.&#xD;
Several of the more progressive of the leading minds had for&#xD;
some time evinced a desire for employing teachers of a differ-&#xD;
ent character from those that had heretofore swayed the rule&#xD;
of authority in the school. By some accidental turn in the&#xD;
wheel of affairs, one of these revolutionists had received the&#xD;
appointment of agent; and he with the cooperation of the&#xD;
minister, procured the engagement of a teacher for the district&#xD;
school from abroad. The candidate for this new honor, was a&#xD;
young man of no more than. twenty-three summers, who had&#xD;
just completed his course of study at college. He came fresh&#xD;

224              THE FISHER BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
TIlE NEW SCHOOL-MASTER,          225&#xD;
&#xD;
from the Tields of science, all fragrant with the rose of litera-&#xD;
ture.&#xD;
So bold a step of departure from the time-worn usage of&#xD;
the district, produced a lively sensation in the neighborhood,&#xD;
but for the Moment, the grumbling of the opposition was&#xD;
drowned amid the fervor of public curiosity. Young maidens&#xD;
hastened forward their nice winter dresses, and summoned&#xD;
from the depths of beauty, their very best looks, wondering in&#xD;
their heart of hearts who was to be blessed with the new&#xD;
teacher's especial attentions. Matrons discussed the probabil-&#xD;
ities of his success with their husbands, and chatted about his&#xD;
imagined qualities, over a cup of tea with their neighbors.&#xD;
While the old men of the neighborhood, put on a grave taci-&#xD;
turnity, ominously expressing the belief that the times Were&#xD;
wofully changing, and that the American Republic could not&#xD;
be expected to last a great while longer.&#xD;
The much looked for day at length arrived. Curiosity&#xD;
was on tiptoe. At half past 8 o'clock, the new school-master&#xD;
was seen to issue from deacon Goodman's, and make his way&#xD;
primly toward the old red school-house. He was a slender&#xD;
young man, but possessed of a graceful, genteel form, with a&#xD;
face of a pale, interesting cast. His dress was plain, but he&#xD;
was garbed in fashionable taste. There was something about&#xD;
his whole bearing revealing an air of the book, something that&#xD;
smacked of the midnight lamp.&#xD;
On the way, he was the observed of all who happened to&#xD;
live upon his route, and many a curious one took -pains to&#xD;
cross his path-way, as it would seem by accident. They all&#xD;
noticed that he was very affable in manner toward Miss&#xD;
Goodman, who very naturally accompanied him to point out&#xD;
the way to the school-house.&#xD;
This becoming manner of the teacher, so trifling as it would&#xD;
seem in itself, was yet made the text of a good deal of com-&#xD;
&#xD;
nient in the district. The young maidens were greatly flut-&#xD;
tered, that Miss Goodman should be the first to win the re-&#xD;
gard of the teacher. They could not see what there was in&#xD;
Sally Goodman, so very taking. Besides, was not such famil-&#xD;
iarity very bold in a stranger, and he their teacher ? They&#xD;
had never seen anything like it in all their born lives, they&#xD;
were sure. They guessed it would be one long while before&#xD;
they allowed him or any man, especially a stranger, to take&#xD;
such latitude with them.&#xD;
The matrons too were not a little shocked in their notions&#xD;
of propriety, by this first behavior of the school-master. They&#xD;
could not but swell with that very noble feeling - virtuous&#xD;
indignation. Rightfully the guardians of the public honor, it&#xD;
was fit that they should give utterance to their opinion upon&#xD;
the subject. Hence, they thought the conduct of the school-&#xD;
master very suspicious. It wasn't best to put too much confi-&#xD;
dence in people. Strangers, especially, 'needed to have a&#xD;
pretty close eye kept after them. It was no matter if he was&#xD;
genteel and innocent looking. These white slivered young&#xD;
men with glossy locks were just the very worst to be found.&#xD;
It was "the still pig that drinks the swill."  Coming from&#xD;
College didn't mend the matter a whit. They had heard&#xD;
enough about the pranks cut up at College. The biggest&#xD;
rogues in the world were such as had got their heads stuffed&#xD;
full of all kinds of learning. On the whole, they concluded&#xD;
the young man must at least be watched pretty closely.&#xD;
The school commenced. The pupils saw at a glance, that&#xD;
a new sun had risen upon them. They found nothing as for-&#xD;
merly, save the house and the familiar faces of comrades.&#xD;
The teacher began his rule by gentle, moral means. He&#xD;
addressed his pupils as rational beings, influenced by the law&#xD;
of kindness. He broached a thorough reform, -a change of&#xD;
text-books, - an innovation always so dangerous to a teacher,&#xD;

TROUBLE IN THE SCHOOL.         227&#xD;
&#xD;
classified the school according to age, and stage of advance-&#xD;
ment, required them to learn the rules, give explanations, and&#xD;
define the words in their lessons.-&#xD;
For a few days, the school current flowed smoothly. In-&#xD;
deed, there was even a gush of enthusiasm from the sponta-&#xD;
neity of youthful, hearts, touched by ~ the spring of novelty.&#xD;
The gleeful wave rippled along the school, like the sun-kissed&#xD;
wavelet. over the pebbled beach. But before this youth-&#xD;
ful glow had subsided, an untoward incident fell upon the&#xD;
teacher's fortune, like a spark lighting into a magazine of'&#xD;
powder.&#xD;
A sturdy little fellow to whom a lesson had been assigned;&#xD;
failed in preparing it. Opportunity was given to make good&#xD;
the delinquency, but the second time the obstinacy of the little&#xD;
fellow triumphed. The teacher now with some little severity,&#xD;
ordered him to remain until the lesson should- be prepared.&#xD;
At this, Rebellion shot from the little tyro's eyes, and flashed&#xD;
from his lowering face, like lightning from a summer thunder&#xD;
'cloud. With a voice and gesture that would have befitted a&#xD;
much older person, he declared boldly that he would do no&#xD;
such thing.&#xD;
The unexpected incident created a rush of sensation&#xD;
throughout the school. Scholars are ever eager for excite-&#xD;
ment, and anything that promises fun, they hail as a god-&#xD;
send. Their sympathies sweep them along with the weaker and&#xD;
suffering party, having little regard to justice or what is befit-&#xD;
ting; and they are ever most ready to show their colors. So&#xD;
long as no eddies got into the current of the school-life, the&#xD;
glow of novelty kept up an unruffled flow.in the stream. But&#xD;
not one of the school was disposed to brook the slightest oppo-&#xD;
sition, from the present incumbent. The chains of their for-&#xD;
mer restraint had been worn too long to be thus suddenly&#xD;
removed with impunity. In little empires, as in great, long&#xD;
&#xD;
existing arbitrary power should be changed only by gradual&#xD;
steps.&#xD;
The culprit perceiving with the unerring instinct of child-&#xD;
hood, that he was deeply entrenched in the sympathies-of the&#xD;
school, held out in dogged defiance. Though a man of kindly&#xD;
feelings, the teacher comprehended the necessity of subduing&#xD;
this rebellious spirit to the authority of the school. To this&#xD;
end, he struggled till the falling shadows of evening cut short&#xD;
the contest, without, however, achieving the result. The un-&#xD;
willing captive released, darted home, a fire-brand through&#xD;
the wintry air. His wrongs portrayed by the eloquent tongue&#xD;
of passion, touched the sympathies of his family at the ten-&#xD;
derest point. The whole household was inflamed with indig-&#xD;
nation. The father, an impulsive, headstrong man, happening&#xD;
withal to be of the opposition, flew into a tornado of passion.&#xD;
Throwing .himself among the discontented of the district, a&#xD;
rebellion was at once fomented. Political interest drew some&#xD;
to its ranks, were excitement attracted some others, while an&#xD;
eager curiosity swelled greatly the cortege.&#xD;
It was unanimously agreed, among the malcontents, that a&#xD;
school-meeting should forthwith be called, to settle the matter&#xD;
without further loss of time. A few people of strong common&#xD;
sense, and of a decided independent .turn of mind, --such as&#xD;
may be found in very small numbers in ahnost every village,&#xD;
quiteashamed of this much ado about nothing -remained at&#xD;
home. Yet the meeting was a large one - that is, the house&#xD;
was filled to its utm st capacity. Young and old, inimical&#xD;
and friendly, had gathered there with a common curiosity.&#xD;
The assembly was er4livened. even with a sprinkling of the&#xD;
fair sex, and the teacher himself had shown the temerity to&#xD;
smuggle in with the rest.&#xD;
Esq. Langdon was voted moderator by acclamation. This&#xD;
gentleman always presided at the public meetings of the neigh-&#xD;

THE SCHOOL-MASTER IN DIFFICULTY.    229&#xD;
&#xD;
boyhood, whenever present. He possessed a kind of ubiquitous&#xD;
trait of character, which enabled him rarely to miss his attend-&#xD;
ance, and consequently, the honor of presiding. The Squire was&#xD;
a highly respectable man; in fact, looking at him from all points&#xD;
of-view, the most purely respectable personage of the neighbor-&#xD;
hood. He united in himself so many winning abilities, as to have&#xD;
long passed for the village oracle. His official character was&#xD;
as varied as country politics, and the offices he was called&#xD;
upon to perform, as multifarious as public life itself. A&#xD;
deacon of the church, he not unfrequently officiated in the&#xD;
absence of the minister, to the great acceptance of everybody.&#xD;
A justice of the peace, he was often called to try petty suits&#xD;
at law, as well as to judge knotty points of jurisprudence, and&#xD;
to draw up the last wills and testaments of such, as had&#xD;
deemed it prudent to set well in order their house, in this&#xD;
world, before leaving it for the next. Added to these he was&#xD;
one of the fathers of the town, a road commissioner, and was&#xD;
not unfrequently called to sit as referee or arbitor, in a com-&#xD;
plicated case of dispute. Sometimes, he had been called to&#xD;
perform the ban of marriage to some happy couple just enter-&#xD;
ing upon their earthly paradise. And from time far beyond&#xD;
the recollection of Walter, he had represented the town in the&#xD;
General Court. He was supposed to have been elected and&#xD;
to retain this most honorable office -partly because of his im-&#xD;
maculate wisdom, and in part, because his family needed the&#xD;
emoluments accruing from so lucrative a situation.&#xD;
Squire Langdon presided. He rose calmly, and with a&#xD;
grave, consequential air, briefly laid open the objects of the&#xD;
meeting. He possessed a pensive, gracious mien, that seemed&#xD;
compounded of wisdom and benevolence, which went far to&#xD;
captivate the imagination of the populace.-&#xD;
The. father of the aggrieved boy first took the floor. He&#xD;
gave utterance to his excited feelings, with impassive verbi-&#xD;
&#xD;
age. He even fretted and tore, until reason abashed, seemed&#xD;
to have descended from its royal throne, and to have with-&#xD;
drawn, in very shame. He took up his complaint, dwelt&#xD;
upon it, turned it over, hammered it upon this side and upon&#xD;
that, until it seemed huge enough to overwhelm the ill-fated&#xD;
teacher. He finally adduced his son as living evidence of the&#xD;
truth of his assertions, and wound up with the fippant re-&#xD;
mark, that such a man was not lit for a tinker, much less for&#xD;
a teacher,&#xD;
The harangue of the next speaker was kindred in tone.&#xD;
He did not need to have been in the school-room, to know&#xD;
how things had been going on there. He could easily read&#xD;
the whole story in the children's faces, as he met them day by&#xD;
day, in the road. And for his part, he guessed there had&#xD;
been some strange doings in the school-room. He shouldn't&#xD;
wonder, if the order had been greatly out of joint. From&#xD;
what he could learn, the school-master had a bran new way&#xD;
of governing, a way that didn't seem to work very well, for it&#xD;
was clear that the scholars had gotten the upper hand of him.&#xD;
Well, it had turned out very much as lie guessed it would,&#xD;
when they told hint how they were agoing to change, and-&#xD;
what manner of man they had gotten. The truth was, green&#xD;
sappling school-masters from out of the country were not just&#xD;
the thing to manage their salt-water boys. He didn't know&#xD;
of any better way to govern than the old fashioned way,&#xD;
namely, when a boy didn't mind, to whip him till he did. He&#xD;
sent his boys to school to behave. If they didn't do this of&#xD;
their own accord, they must be made to. He.didn't wish the&#xD;
teacher to show them any quarter. If the boys stood out, the&#xD;
teacher might kill them, and the father would make coffins for&#xD;
them.&#xD;
The unearthly tone of this last sentence, sent a wild thrill&#xD;
through every breast, and brought to his feet a tall, fierce&#xD;
20&#xD;

DIVERSE OPINIONS.             231&#xD;
&#xD;
looking man, in whose face the fires of anger shot forth like&#xD;
tongues of flame, beneath a half-pent fire.&#xD;
He was exactly of the same opinion as the last speaker.&#xD;
For one, he hadn't liked either the order or the teaching in&#xD;
that school. He was no friend to such new angled notions.&#xD;
He was for the old way. Plain sailing was the thing to his&#xD;
taste; One thing he could say certain. His boy hadn't&#xD;
learned a word since the school had commenced. He didn't&#xD;
want his children coaxed up with sweetmeats. Bring them&#xD;
right up to the ring-bolt. Pinch their ears till they screamed,&#xD;
"0 !"  That would be one letter, at least.&#xD;
There was now a pause. Squire Langdon, the moderator,&#xD;
with great propriety filled the gap. He descanted with ver-&#xD;
bose dignity upon the nature of the case. Usually his lan-&#xD;
guage was such, that you could not tell to which side he&#xD;
leaned, a circumstance which gave him the air of profound&#xD;
judgment, and a scrupulous care in forming an opinion. But&#xD;
in this instance, the preponderance of public opinion was such&#xD;
as to warrant a departure from his usual wont, and he very&#xD;
palpably hinted, that the best way would be to break up the&#xD;
school, and try a new teacher.&#xD;
The school-master perceiving the current to be setting so&#xD;
unmistakably against him, arose, and in a .calm, logical man-&#xD;
ner, endeavored to justify his course. He assured the assem-&#xD;
bly, that if permitted a fair trial, he could convince them of&#xD;
the virtue of his principles. But he found the torrent setting&#xD;
against him -too strong to be stemmed. The school was&#xD;
broken up, and the teacher summarily dismissed in dis-&#xD;
grace.&#xD;
The gentle spirit of the teacher, crushed with the feeling of&#xD;
the wrong done him, took his departure from the district&#xD;
and place' forever. So rude and mortifying treatment, just&#xD;
upon the threshold of responsible life, gave a shock to his sen-&#xD;
&#xD;
sitive nature from which he never fully recovered. Hieing&#xD;
him to obscure life, he betook himself to scribbling and mel-&#xD;
ancholy, and died a victim to morbid sensibility.&#xD;
Meanwhile, the school was again started- under the- auspices&#xD;
of one of the old standard teachers. of the district, the confi-&#xD;
dence of the community became speedily restored, and very&#xD;
soon all was as quiet as if there had been not a ripple upon&#xD;
the bosom of their late so agitated society.&#xD;
"But all is not Rome that is of Rome." . There were a few&#xD;
of the district whose finer feelings revolted at the treatment&#xD;
their late beloved teacher had received. Small in number,&#xD;
they were yet strong in influence of opinion, because of the&#xD;
universal faith in their elevated sense and truthfulness. The&#xD;
swelling tide of numbers and the whirl of hfman clamor, do.&#xD;
not always bear away in their course the primal convictions of&#xD;
society. There often springs a counter current, flowing from&#xD;
the well-spring of honest nature, which, like the under stream&#xD;
of a mighty river, moves on noiseless and unseen, but certain&#xD;
and resistless, bearing the accumulated train of waters into&#xD;
the bosom of the ocean-eternity of truth!&#xD;
Of the small number whose wrathfulness of soul rose in&#xD;
indignation at the spray of ignominy flung at their late&#xD;
teacher, and whose loyalty of nature bid them express with-&#xD;
,out counting the cost, their fullest measure of disapprobation&#xD;
of the act, were Walter and his mother, and the families of&#xD;
two others whose sons were of about the same age as that of&#xD;
the Fisher Boy.&#xD;
These three resolved quietly to withdraw from the school,&#xD;
and attend at the Old Parish, some two or three miles&#xD;
distant. In spite of their secret movements in the matter,&#xD;
their intention early leaked out, as the most vigilantly&#xD;
guarded secret is sure to do in a country village. The rumor&#xD;
had soon flown to every body's ear. As strange as it may&#xD;

seem, it awakened a sensation, but a little less intense than&#xD;
did the advent of the late vanquished teacher. A decided&#xD;
feeling of envy ruffled the neighborhood, but the rebuke it&#xD;
bore for the abandonment of the teacher, plucked the barb&#xD;
from that emotion. Besides the parents of two of the boys,&#xD;
were not to be questioned for independent action. And as&#xD;
for Walter, although he encountered here and there, a fling&#xD;
of irony, as to the ability of his mother to support him in his&#xD;
ambitious pretensions, he arose after some struggles of spirit,&#xD;
above these ,wounding reproaches, resolving to allow their bit-&#xD;
terness only to inspire him with higher purpose and firmer&#xD;
step, in the upward road of a noble career.&#xD;
When the first wave of agitation had subsided, there was&#xD;
an honest feeling of regret, at the contemplated leaving of the&#xD;
boys. To lose from the society of their school, three of their&#xD;
choicest spirits, would be, it was felt, a great loss, and already&#xD;
the impending cloud of sorrow cast its shadow before. But&#xD;
both parties possessed too much pride of dignity, to advance&#xD;
overtures for a compromise, and each day's sun only bright-&#xD;
ened more clearly the devious paths of their course.&#xD;

CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
"Love is a celestial harmony&#xD;
Of likely hearts."&#xD;
SPENCER'S HYMN IN HONOR OF BEAUTY.&#xD;
THERE iWas now to be a new turn in the current of Wal-&#xD;
ter's life. He was going to school at the Old Parish. The&#xD;
thought was very pleasing to him, and yet the delight'it af-&#xD;
forded was not unmixed with a certain indefinable emotion,&#xD;
that made him feel loth, after all, to commence bending his&#xD;
steps thitherward. In truth, the boy inherited by nature an&#xD;
uncontrollable bashfulness, and this, with a certain prestige&#xD;
which the Old Parish held in his mind, brought a tremulous&#xD;
emotion to his breast, in view of becoming a participator in&#xD;
its society.&#xD;
The Old Parish he had ever been accustomed to look up to&#xD;
with feelings of profound reverence. All its scenes were&#xD;
associated in his mind with sentiments of youthful venera-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
There ascended the Old Parish Church, mellowed by time,&#xD;
yet ever fragrant with the sweet sanctity of worship. Here&#xD;
from time beyond the memory of Walter, had weekly held&#xD;
forth the Rev. Mr. Radcliff, the Revolutionary 'Patriot, the&#xD;
genial wit, the college bred scholar, and the ministerial oracle&#xD;
of the town. With his stately, venerable form, his graceful&#xD;
port, his antique costume, his elegant diction, tempered with&#xD;
benignity, the veteran preacher was pictured upon the mem-&#xD;

&#xD;
ory of Walter, with ineffaceable distinctness, a living daguer-&#xD;
reotype of the courtly times of the past.&#xD;
Near the gray old church, stood the Town's Poor House,&#xD;
the dread of tottering humanity, but the almoner of Heaven-&#xD;
descending charity.&#xD;
Not far from these, glared the Old Rickety Town House,&#xD;
looking consequential in its broad interest of the political&#xD;
family.&#xD;
Upon the county road running through the neighborhood,&#xD;
might have been seen in lowly guise, about the only "West&#xD;
India and Dry Good Store" in town, drawing thither the&#xD;
needy from all quarters, and supplying them with the useful&#xD;
and ornamental with tireless hand.&#xD;
In a broad neighboring field, where the frugal pines had&#xD;
refused to grow, was mustered the Yearly General Training.&#xD;
This inspiring pageant was sure to sweep for at least one day&#xD;
in the year, the whole living town into a focus, to have their&#xD;
pulses quickened by martial display, and to revel in social in-&#xD;
terchange and physical gratification.&#xD;
On an eminence, stood the slumbering, red powder house&#xD;
of the Town, and near it squat upon the ground, the big iron&#xD;
cannon, that thundered out, of a fourth of July, the remem-&#xD;
brance of our national birth day.&#xD;
It was in the Old Parish, that lived some of the oldest and&#xD;
most consequential families of the town. Indeed, the very&#xD;
site Was the most elevated part of the township, and over-&#xD;
looked the adjacent country, as the Parish people looked&#xD;
down upon those residing in other parts of the settlement.&#xD;
Was it wonderful, therefore, that this favored centralization&#xD;
should feel a little puffed up with local vanity?&#xD;
For the school then --in the Old Parish, so exalted in the&#xD;
mirage of his youthful fancy, he was to exchange the long&#xD;
familiar one of his home.&#xD;
&#xD;
SETTING OUT FOR THE NEW SCHOOL.           235&#xD;
It was of a Monday morning that he set out, all flushed&#xD;
with the novel feelings of the change.&#xD;
He started very early and alone,-that he might have time&#xD;
to call on the agent of the district whither he was going, to&#xD;
secure the preliminary written permit, to enter on the foot-&#xD;
ing of a member of the district.&#xD;
Naturally timid, he would have been glad of the company&#xD;
of his two associates, to make his debut into the new school,&#xD;
but they had already received a certificate of admission, and,&#xD;
consequently, had no need of leaving home so early.&#xD;
He made his toilet that morning with unusual care, as if&#xD;
inspired with a pleasing presentiment of the value of decora-&#xD;
tion. There are times when the soul would fain adorn the&#xD;
body with the blooming freshness of its own feelings.&#xD;
After words of noble advice from his angel mother, he&#xD;
closed the door behind him of their simply furnished apart-&#xD;
ments.&#xD;
The frosty morning air breaking in upon his sense, lent a&#xD;
keen invigoration to his elastic steps, while the warm eddying&#xD;
glow which the exercise of the route diffused throughout his&#xD;
system, awoke to beauty of perception every faculty sof his&#xD;
being. As he bounded along the crooked and uneven way,&#xD;
smiling nature around swelled with an air of grandeur and&#xD;
sweetness upon his mental horizon, and existence itself, rosy&#xD;
with the bright wings of morning, nestled within his breast,&#xD;
as a halcyon boon, radiant with joy and love.&#xD;
How happy those moments, when the soul, bursting the&#xD;
fetters of sordid life, breaks forth upon its throne of glory,&#xD;
like some sudden illumination of enchantment,-imparting a&#xD;
magic touch to the golden threads of our affections, and&#xD;
gilding every outward object with its rays of celestial fire.&#xD;
Then it is that the inspiration for a grander life seizes and&#xD;
distends the soul; then that the heart pants with true pulsa-&#xD;

&#xD;
tions for the noble and sublime ; then that we are transported&#xD;
to elysian fields, where vistas of enrapturing beauty shadow&#xD;
forth upon the enchanted sense the divine charms of an&#xD;
eternal blessedness.&#xD;
These vivid gleamings of the soul, like gushing sunlight&#xD;
through April clouds, show to what serene exaltation we&#xD;
might-attain were our life simple and noble, beautiful and&#xD;
true, in harmony. with nature and congenial with virtue.&#xD;
They reveal, moreover, the transcendent, immortalnature of&#xD;
man, his. boundless, varied capacity for happiness, while'&#xD;
shadowing to his feeble comprehension the pure, illimitable&#xD;
joys of heaven.&#xD;
Thus, the gracious divinity of his teeming brain cast her&#xD;
benign spell over his buoyant spirit, drawing to her charmed&#xD;
embrace the impressionable faculties, and breathing over&#xD;
them the dewy fragrance of her own sweet incense. Indeed,&#xD;
his mind seemed to have been gradually drawn inward until&#xD;
he was quite oblivious to the sharp outline of the world&#xD;
without.&#xD;
In that enthralled, glowing state, he wended his way&#xD;
mechanically, a way not much less familiar to him than the&#xD;
time-trodden paths about his home. He soon' approached a&#xD;
valley, one of those deep, regular valleys extending for many&#xD;
miles across the country, seeming to mark some energetic&#xD;
volcanic change at a previous period of the world's history.&#xD;
This was covered with coppice, extending to within a narrow&#xD;
margin of the bed, through which ran a tiny stream, dry in&#xD;
the summer, but now swollen by the fall rains, it was gurgling&#xD;
its way toward the ocean with something of the strut of a&#xD;
more lordly stream of water.&#xD;
As he was turning an angle of the road, that brought to&#xD;
view a crossing of the stream, his eye unexpectedly fell upon&#xD;
the form of a girl. She was standing upon the opposite bank&#xD;
&#xD;
of the swollen rivulet, across which a couple of rails had been&#xD;
lain to accommodate passers.&#xD;
When the young girl first struck his view she had just&#xD;
placed her small plump foot upon the rustic bridge-way, evi-&#xD;
dently in the act of crossing, but catching a glimpse of the&#xD;
boy, she naively retreated, partially concealing herself behind&#xD;
a cluster of shrubbery, as if she shrunk from exposing herself&#xD;
in a new situation before a stranger.&#xD;
This sudden meeting of a girl of about his own age, and&#xD;
unknown to him, completely aroused Walter from his sweet&#xD;
musings, and sent a wild flash of emotion through his heart.&#xD;
He stood for a moment irresolute, overcome by that strange&#xD;
delight that woman by her mere presence has the unconscious&#xD;
power of awakening in man. But summoning courage, he&#xD;
stepped boldly forward, and delicately tendered his aid for&#xD;
her crossing.&#xD;
The girl acquiesced without solicitation, but with a charm of&#xD;
grace so unaffected as to touch the finest chord of the beautiful&#xD;
within his own breast. And when her soft, trembling fingers&#xD;
met his own, accompanied by a look of gratitude so sweet&#xD;
as to be richly laden with reward, a wave of delicious sensi-&#xD;
bility swept over his soul, and thrilled through every fibre of&#xD;
his being.&#xD;
As her feet touched the coveted bank, she bowed to Walter&#xD;
a token of cordial acknowledgment, blushing at the same&#xD;
time, an apology for the sensation she had caused him, then&#xD;
turning upon the boy a final look of bewitching complaisance,&#xD;
she bounded off with a step as light and a movement as airy&#xD;
as those of a fawn upon the mountain green.&#xD;
Walter was rivited to the spot spell-bound, entranced; and&#xD;
there he stood, gazing with mute but enraptured emotions&#xD;
after the enchanting vision, until her divine form faded&#xD;
entirely from view. What was it that had enthroned so sud-&#xD;

238 '           TUE FISHER BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
denly the fair girl in his breast? What that had imprinted&#xD;
her image, as with lines of fire, upon the beauty-tablet of his&#xD;
soul? Was it her exquisitely neat fitting dress, revealing&#xD;
limbs divinely moulded?  Was it those soft, golden ringlets,&#xD;
toying so delicately her snowy neck and breast? Was it those&#xD;
joyous, speaking eyes, eyes of heavenly azure, mirroring a&#xD;
soul of melting tenderness, but pure as the gushing spring&#xD;
upon the hill-side?  Was it that sweet, dainty mouth, around&#xD;
which played a soft, perpetual smile, ineffable of inward&#xD;
delight ?  Or, was it the captivating grace of her manner, so&#xD;
simple, so unconscious, yet so charming to his finer sense ;&#xD;
or, with a more philosophic air, could it be attributed to the&#xD;
poetic complexion of his own feelings, enlivened by meeting a&#xD;
fair young girl under so pleasing circumstances, that had&#xD;
enkindled his imagination and clothed the living object of his&#xD;
vision with the gorgeous hues of his own impressionable soul?&#xD;
Or, further still, must it be more deeply sought in that myste-&#xD;
rious sympathy of the human heart, which, like the magnet of&#xD;
nature, while it maintains its influence with unweilding per-&#xD;
sistency, evades all explanation as to the secret of its power?&#xD;
Was it one, or all of these combined, that had so wonderfully&#xD;
transformed his very existence?  Of this, he did not care to&#xD;
seek the solution. He only knew that whereas before blind&#xD;
in the exquisite sense of the heart, he now saw with beatific&#xD;
vision. The fetters of his soul had dissolved, and his happy&#xD;
spirit was leaping in the sunlight of joy.. All the traits of&#xD;
female loveliness that had ever gleamed athwart his spiritual&#xD;
vision seemed now concentrated in one sweet image that was&#xD;
glowing in his breast with transcendent brightness. He did&#xD;
not even ask himself if these enchanting feelings of his heart&#xD;
were shared. or reciprocated by the angelic being that had&#xD;
called them forth. These emotions for the instant were too&#xD;
disinterested to claim homage from another; too generous&#xD;
&#xD;
were they to exact a return. For the time, he was content to&#xD;
revel in the blissful dream into which he had fallen, and to&#xD;
enfold to his gladsome embrace the beaming image alone that&#xD;
had so entranced his soul. How pure the love that springs&#xD;
from the crystal fount of the soul, that casts the radiance of&#xD;
its own joy upon all without, that is happy in the supreme in&#xD;
the delight of its own gracious communings, -the love that&#xD;
is unmixed with the sting- of remorse, unsullied with the&#xD;
sordid fang of passion.&#xD;
Amid the bright dawning of his new emotions, he felt a&#xD;
mild force that lent a grateful elevation to his feelings. It&#xD;
was like the glow of power, the charm of possession, the&#xD;
sweet joy of a kindred spirit, the dew and sunshine of con-&#xD;
geniality, the halcyon security of an intimate relation. It&#xD;
was a feeling kindred to that which glows in the breast of the&#xD;
mother as she catches for the first time the breath of her&#xD;
newly-born,-of the loving husband, who feels for the first&#xD;
time, upon his arm, the elastic weight of a double existence.&#xD;
In this delightful mood he bounded forward-with a buoyant&#xD;
step. Surrounding nature seemed to reflect the lively hues&#xD;
of his own emotions. The light air fanned his cheek wooingly.&#xD;
The verdant pines seemed joining their hands in love. The&#xD;
sky had a smile of joy. The fleecy clouds were soft with&#xD;
delicious langour ; and even the sober and gray fields looked&#xD;
mild with a serene benignity. The tiny brook that he leaped&#xD;
was babbling in tQnes of affection, and the little gray squirrel&#xD;
that tripped athwart his pathway seemed ready to nestle in&#xD;
his bosom and there chatter out its tale of life.&#xD;
Reaching the agent's, and obtaining the desired certificate,&#xD;
Walter flew back towards the parish school-house. The low,&#xD;
quaint, red edifice soon broke, forth to his view. In a few&#xD;
moments longer he was standing before its rough portal,&#xD;
blanched and furrowed by the peltings of the weather, and&#xD;
scarred by the vandalism of Yankee boyhood.&#xD;

240             THE FISHER BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
The teacher, with a mild, intelligent countenance, welcomed&#xD;
him within. As the boy entered, his abashed glance met a&#xD;
sea of upturned faces, and among them upon whom should his&#xD;
eye fall but upon the face of the identical girl whom he had&#xD;
met that very morning at the crossing described. As her&#xD;
glance met his, he thought to detect a delicate blush upon her&#xD;
cheek, that blush that obtrudes unconsciously at the strange-&#xD;
ness of one's own sensations, while her eye suddenly fell upon&#xD;
the bench before her, as if fearful of trusting to view that&#xD;
feature of the form divine that is wont to reveal so unmis-&#xD;
takably the emotions of the heart.&#xD;
At so unexpected a re-encounter with the fair girl, a thrill&#xD;
of excitement shot through the frame of the boy. The blood&#xD;
mounted with a rush to his cheeks, and then subsided with a&#xD;
warm, tingling sensation to the verge of his extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
"The cause of love can never be assigned,&#xD;
Tis in no face, but in the lover's mind."-'-DRYDEN.&#xD;
IT is a severe trial to a timid nature, that of being suddenly&#xD;
ushered into a society of strangers, and there left to delve&#xD;
one's way to an easy acquaintance with them. Besides, Wal&#xD;
ter was affected by a tender sentiment that colored all his per-&#xD;
ceptions, and placed him ill at ease in his feelings. This was&#xD;
all the worse, because lie naturally desired to appear to the&#xD;
best advantage in the eyes of others, while the peculiar em-&#xD;
barrassments under which lie labored tended continually to&#xD;
surprise him into some little mortifying - act of demeanor.&#xD;
But the two companions from his own district served in the&#xD;
outset to fortify his timorous spirit.  The teacher at once&#xD;
approached the boy, in a gentle, winning way, and soon&#xD;
secured - his confidence.  One after another of thev- warm,&#xD;
generous-hearted school-mates won his regard by some tender&#xD;
act of welcome. In fact, the entire sympathetic current of&#xD;
the school was continually swelling up in his breast a commu-&#xD;
nity of feeling, until in a brief space of time he was on so&#xD;
easy terms of familiarity with the whole little community that&#xD;
he wondered that he could ever have felt as a stranger among&#xD;
them.&#xD;
It would surpass the limits of our narrative to  detail the&#xD;
many pleasing incidents of the winter's school at the Parish.&#xD;

SCHOOL COMPANIONS.            243&#xD;
&#xD;
Suffice it to say that the season passed charmingly, leaving&#xD;
behind one of those bright spots in the sunny period of youth,&#xD;
that the heart clings to so fondly in after life. The entire&#xD;
community at the new school was quite superior in point of&#xD;
elevation and refinement to the one at home. The teacher,&#xD;
though a similar style of man from the one so summarily&#xD;
ejected from his own school, here enjoyed perfect success,&#xD;
being in a different social and literary atmosphere, and called&#xD;
to rule unlike elements of character.&#xD;
A happy spirit of mutual good will throbbed through the&#xD;
school; and Walter, enjoying a high degree of mingled forti-&#xD;
tude and self-respect from the summer's strengthening adven-&#xD;
tures and from the lustre of novelty around him, was thrown&#xD;
into a frame of mind most delectable. Not that there were&#xD;
no troublesome eddies in the stream of the winter's school,-&#xD;
such as an occasional ripple of indignation at some fancied in-&#xD;
justice on the part of the teacher ; now and then a falling out&#xD;
between some rather intimate couple, resulting in a temporary&#xD;
alienation, but soon made up with deepened affection ; here a&#xD;
momentary heartburn, there a little jealousy. At one time,&#xD;
a lump of gossip thrown among them as leaven ; at another,&#xD;
the belching to light of some covert act or manner, demanding&#xD;
a rebuke from authority; and such like foibles of human&#xD;
nature which are, after all, but the spice of small societies.&#xD;
But, on the whole, the spirit of the school was excellent, and&#xD;
the improvement good; and Walter felt a degree of large&#xD;
tranquillity, such as he had never before experienced. His&#xD;
soul seemed to expand with elevating emotions under the&#xD;
benign influence.&#xD;
If one idle trait more than another got ascendency, and&#xD;
took to itself undue share of time, it was a species of intimacy&#xD;
that sprang up between the older of the boys and girls. This&#xD;
would not unfrequently be seen in interchange of furtive&#xD;
&#xD;
glances, in forbidden slate communications of flattering ad..&#xD;
dresses and arch replies, and in an occasional billet doux,&#xD;
containing here and there a pretty, but indefinite sentiment.&#xD;
Out of school hours the charming maidens were wont at times&#xD;
to have proffered them a more substantial expression of favor,&#xD;
in the form of fruit or some little gift-token, and they were as&#xD;
often subjected to those warm, delicate attentions that spring&#xD;
up between the sexes as sweetly as gush out the crystal&#xD;
waters from the fount of nature.&#xD;
But there were three among the girls that shared more&#xD;
largely than all the rest, of this homage. Indeed, the whole&#xD;
school by accord raised them by its affection upon an elevated&#xD;
pedestal of worship. Yet in personal appearance, in indi-&#xD;
vidual character, and in that indefinable charm in which lies&#xD;
the mysterious power of woman, they were as unlike as could&#xD;
well be imagined. They seemed to unite by contrarieties, as&#xD;
nature often forms the closest union from opposite elements,&#xD;
for to appearance they were bound. in more than sisterly&#xD;
concord.&#xD;
Of this lovely trio, Angeline Readcliff was the queen&#xD;
flower. She it was that drew forth the heart-incense of the&#xD;
entire school. Her two devoted 'companions were but lesser&#xD;
settings to the central, lustrous diamond that flashed in the&#xD;
sunlight, and challenged the admiration of all. It was this&#xD;
girl that Walter encountered at the crossing, and whose eyes&#xD;
met his with such mysterious magnetism on entering the&#xD;
school. Nature and life had formed her among the loveliest&#xD;
of earth's beautiful flowers. The pet grand-daughter of the&#xD;
parish clergyman already noted, the sweet dignity of the&#xD;
venerable man of God, and his pure holiness seemed to have&#xD;
descended like a delicate.mantle upon this tender lamb of his&#xD;
fold. One might have said that she had caught from the-&#xD;
halo of earthly glory that surrounded the venerable man, as&#xD;

A SHOW OF GALLANTRY.            245&#xD;
&#xD;
244               THE FISHER R BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
the heroines of old hallowed lustre from the prestige of rank&#xD;
and wealth.- The idol of her parents, she inherited from her&#xD;
mother a certain graceful affection not easily portrayed, and&#xD;
from her father a nobleness of soul that forbade all meanness.&#xD;
From her tenderest babyhood she had been beloved by&#xD;
everybody.  She had become the adoptive child of the uni-&#xD;
versal heart. The instincts of the masses, true to the im-&#xD;
pulses of nature, had enfolded her to their bosom as  by&#xD;
common inheritage. The affection, the reverence, which&#xD;
people felt for the village pastor was now lavished upon his&#xD;
sweet grand-child. The loving tenderness which his minis-&#xD;
trations had swelled up in the hearts of his hearers now&#xD;
flowed forth upon the blooming scion of his old age.&#xD;
But these profuse attentions did not spoil the girl, as flat-&#xD;
tery is almost sure to do, because, in this case, they were only&#xD;
an unaffected response to genuine worth, and sprang by nat-&#xD;
ural impulse from the heart.&#xD;
There are two types of female grace in the world. One is&#xD;
the off-shoot of culture and art, the other springs from the&#xD;
dewy lap of nature, and finds expression in the golden sun-&#xD;
shine, the melody of birds, the gushing, dancing rivulet, and&#xD;
in all the sweet, joyous harmony of the universe. Angeline&#xD;
was a true child of nature, and of nature in her brightest and&#xD;
loveliest phase.&#xD;
Artless, noble, and generous, she may yet have had faults,&#xD;
but as no one else could see any, we will not seek to find&#xD;
them ourselves. Her goodness of heart proved a talisman to&#xD;
win, and changed to delight the eye that strove for a blemish.&#xD;
In her slightest movement there was an air of simple, but&#xD;
queenly dignity, that heightened her charms of person to the&#xD;
summit of perfection, Without this grace, her soft beauty&#xD;
might have palled upon the eye, like the golden fleck of the&#xD;
summer lake. But with it she .stood out a beautiful statue&#xD;
upon a fine pile of architecture.&#xD;
&#xD;
But it was not the outward beauty of her person that im-&#xD;
parted to the girl her peculiar fascination. It sprang from a&#xD;
deeper source. It emanated from a beautiful soul. It was&#xD;
this that lit up her comely form with irresistible charms, this&#xD;
that drew the world to her in ardent homage, this that flooded&#xD;
her pathway with sunshine, this that surrounded her with a&#xD;
halo of loveliness to which every fibre of the angelic in man&#xD;
responded in tones of sweet accord.&#xD;
But the young girl was as unconscious of this wondrous spell&#xD;
of spiritual beauty that she possessed, as the morning bird&#xD;
warbling in the breezy spray is of the sweet melody of its song.&#xD;
Accustomed from rosy infancy to the heart-homage of every&#xD;
body, she grew up in an atmosphere of genial incense. To&#xD;
be greeted always with the tones of love, to be regarded ever&#xD;
with the eye of affection, to hear continually words of good&#xD;
will, had ever been so much her portion as to awaken in her&#xD;
breast no other than a feeling of complaisant gratitude. It&#xD;
filled her with happiness, made her life joyous, and her&#xD;
spirit as blithesome as a summer butterfly.&#xD;
The attentions of the more susceptible of the boys began&#xD;
in the course of the winter to assume an aspect of delicate&#xD;
gallantry, and more than once some one, more bold. than the&#xD;
rest, essayed to give a significance to his partiality. To a&#xD;
heart less sophisticated than that of Angeline, these beguiling&#xD;
flatteries might have awakened an emotion of uneasiness, but&#xD;
to the simple-hearted girl they disturbed not the equalized flow&#xD;
of her sentiments. She took it but as a more ardent expres-&#xD;
sion of the kindness she had always received, and she con-&#xD;
tinued to move on in her wonted orbit, as some brilliant star&#xD;
amid a host of willing satellites.&#xD;
It were not easy to find the secret of the power that the&#xD;
fair girl had cast over Walter. Philosophy may penetrate&#xD;
the hidden recesses of matter, may trace the subtile laws of&#xD;

&#xD;
mind, may even detect the affinity of the affections, but there&#xD;
are mysteries of the heart too deep for her sounding plummet,&#xD;
too profound for her searching eye.&#xD;
Still, it is permitted us to scan with philosophic eye, the&#xD;
train of circumstances that brightened the image glowing in&#xD;
his breast. Walter inherited deeply a tender and impres~-&#xD;
sionable nature. The grief-stricken and gentle spirit of his&#xD;
mother, nursed by sympathy, this native quality of soul. His&#xD;
lowly condition kept him in close relation with the genuine in&#xD;
life. He was blessed by nature with a lively susceptibility to&#xD;
the beautiful. The scenes of rural simplicity that surrounded&#xD;
his early years imparted a sweet tone to his sentiments. A&#xD;
thoughtful turn of mind, imparted a pensive complexion to&#xD;
his ideas.&#xD;
These ethereal flames of his soul finding no outlet amid the&#xD;
rich fields of literature, science, and art, were narrowed within&#xD;
their native confines. But they thereby gained in intensity&#xD;
what was lost in expansion. They gradually fired his nature,&#xD;
quickening every latent energy of his being.&#xD;
With no outward objects for exaltation, they sought to&#xD;
create an image within, upon which to spend their fires.&#xD;
Woman became that image. In her, Walter saw, or thought&#xD;
he saw, all that most answered to the sweet cravings of his&#xD;
own soul,-truth; piety, fidelity simplicity, gentleness, grace,&#xD;
tenderness, love, consummate beauty. Not that he had met&#xD;
with any one woman thus endowed, but- somehow from  the&#xD;
crucible of his soul one had been struck out with just the&#xD;
qualities he could wish ; and busy imagination kept pace&#xD;
with his growing conceptions, so as-to continue the image up&#xD;
to the full measure of its charming proportions. He had'&#xD;
attained unconsciously, precisely the object sought by the&#xD;
sculptor, in representing by inanimate form, his highest con-&#xD;
ceptions of female beauty: by the true poet artist who delineates&#xD;
&#xD;
not any one woman whom he may have seen, but by the exercise&#xD;
of the high power of abstraction, selects from extensive survey,&#xD;
here one exquisite feature, there another, and then by the keen&#xD;
umpire of judgment and the gilding touch of taste, unites and&#xD;
blends them into one harmonious perfection, adding to all the&#xD;
nameless grace caught by passing through the alembic of his&#xD;
own peculiar feeling. Thus the artist presents his highest&#xD;
embodied conceptions of beautiful woman,-not of any one&#xD;
woman, but of woman in the abstract,- not of woman improved&#xD;
by the genius of man, but a beautiful creation drawn all from&#xD;
nature, and representing woman as she appears to the highest&#xD;
inspiration of the poetic, gifted soul.&#xD;
It was such an ideal image of woman, or of all that to his&#xD;
sense was most beautiful and lovely in woman, that was&#xD;
pictured upon the tablet of his soul. Before this created image,&#xD;
he was ever kneeling in mute, adoring worship. With it he&#xD;
communed incessantly upon the mysterious secrets of the&#xD;
heart. It became his guardian divinity, holding him back&#xD;
from all that was low and base, and filling him with aspirations&#xD;
for the lovely and true. It was ever his noblest, sweetest&#xD;
companion, before him alike in the dark sea-watches of the&#xD;
night, amid the black mutterings of the tempest, and at the&#xD;
brightest blaze of noon-day, amid the thickest haunts of men.&#xD;
And finally when he lay down to sleep, it was his last conscious&#xD;
vision of earth, and the first bright image to greet his awaken-&#xD;
ing sense, and in his dreams, it mingled freely in the peopled&#xD;
realms of that other land, swaying its sceptre even over the&#xD;
empire of sleep.&#xD;
But how came it, that Walter's devotion for this bright&#xD;
ideal image in his breast was transferred to the fair girl, the&#xD;
queen of the village school?  Let us hasten to tell all we know&#xD;
about that mysterious little secret.&#xD;

AN IDEAL IMAGE,          247&#xD;

<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC8107-00000126"/>&#xD;
248              THE FISHER BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
The first morning, while going to the agent's he fell into one&#xD;
of those spiritual moods, as we have seen when the soul is&#xD;
entranced, and becomes lively susceptible to the beauty of earth&#xD;
and heaven. When the fair stranger first met his view, he felt&#xD;
of a sudden, a delightful transformation of soul. No touch of&#xD;
the electric wire could have been more sudden, more keen. As&#xD;
he handed the fair one over the scanty bridge-way, a wave of&#xD;
new-born emotion rolled through his soul. And on turning to&#xD;
pursue his way, after gazing in a state of delicious entrance-&#xD;
ment, at the receding form that had awakened him to new life,&#xD;
he felt conscious that the image which had been wont to usurp&#xD;
his breast, was there no more, and in its stead sat divinely&#xD;
enthroned the image of the fair girl who had just lighted in&#xD;
his pathway, like an angel from heave*.&#xD;
It became a moment of profound ecstasy. The blissful&#xD;
dream of his youth was all at once realized. He had awakend&#xD;
to a new birth. A regeneration of existence had come over&#xD;
him. It was no longer a mere image, a picture of the&#xD;
imagination, indefinite and unsatisfying that he must now&#xD;
worship, but a real being of life, a creature of breathing flame,&#xD;
a veritable woman whom his rapturous eye had seen, his&#xD;
emotional sense touched, and who with himself was one of the&#xD;
great beating world of life and sympathy.&#xD;
The reality was nearly overpowering. He seemed translated&#xD;
to a new world. The varied relations of life brightened up&#xD;
in glowing aspects.- The future which had hung with such a&#xD;
cloud of gloom over his pathway became all at once as bright&#xD;
and serene as a summer morning. He felt as light and&#xD;
blithesome as an uncaged bird which sniffs the air and sunlight&#xD;
of heaven.&#xD;
It is not contended that the love which Walter felt for the&#xD;
fair Angeline was the only phase which that master passion of&#xD;
&#xD;
the human heart assumes. It was not for instance that love&#xD;
which absorbs the soul of woman, and throws her, young and&#xD;
beautiful though she be, prostrate in utter devotion at the feet&#xD;
of age and deformity itself, if that age and deformity be&#xD;
enshrined with genius and heroism, making the earth resound&#xD;
with acts of grandeur and power.&#xD;
It was not that love, which is but the response of a grateful&#xD;
heart, a heart too generous to withstand long assiduous atten-&#xD;
tions of devotion on the part of another, or, it may be,&#xD;
becoming charmed by noble acts of friendship, is cap-&#xD;
tivated, held in thrall, and finally subdued in sweet conquest.&#xD;
It was not that true love which springs up between congenial&#xD;
natures, natures possessing bonds of common sympathy, beings&#xD;
with whom a mutual life has cemented -a friendship tha t&#xD;
renders them, though distinct like the billoivs, yet one like the&#xD;
sea, hearts that have grown with fibres gradually interlocking,&#xD;
united cleaving with fleshly tenacity, bosoms that swell with a&#xD;
kindred emotion, an enraptured state in which eye answers to&#xD;
eye, and lip to lip, and souls are cemented in a union&#xD;
inseparable.&#xD;
The love which Walter bore Miss Redcliffe was an ideal&#xD;
love. It could not be called real, only so far as it existed in&#xD;
his- own soul. Indeed it was little more than an intense&#xD;
sentiment, a poetic enthusiasm, the beautiful creation of his&#xD;
own soul transferred by some mysterious power to a kindred&#xD;
being.&#xD;
He had yielded the sceptre of power to another, had raised&#xD;
her to a throne of empire universal, had created her an immac-&#xD;
ulate goddess before whom he was to bow in unquestioned&#xD;
worship. Whether this partner of his soul possessed the&#xD;
qualities assigned her by the generous affections, of Walter's&#xD;
heart, could not be known.  If she did not, what a gulf of&#xD;
&#xD;
I,&#xD;

Li&#xD;

IDEAL LOVE$             249&#xD;

QUEEN OF THE VILLAGE SCHOOL.      251&#xD;
&#xD;
misery might lay before them. How dangerous the path of&#xD;
love trod by woman. She decks herself and displays her arts&#xD;
in order to please. That may be well. But if in winning&#xD;
the prize, on securing the transfer to herself of that beautiful&#xD;
ideal man's longing heart has formed to himself, he wakes up&#xD;
to find that he has parted with a beautiful love, but has gained&#xD;
none in return, that the fair being that captivated him,&#xD;
possesses no qualities in correspondence with the image he had&#xD;
so long embraced and worshipped, that the reality has vanished&#xD;
into the air, that it is a phantom that he was embracing, that&#xD;
all has been delusion, how unhappy for him, how miserable&#xD;
for her!-&#xD;
Let woman then seek to be what she appears. Nature has&#xD;
fashioned her in person beautiful.  It has given her the&#xD;
elements of a corresponding loveliness of soul. A soul as&#xD;
superior to the body in angelic beauty, as mind is raised high&#xD;
above matter. Let her cultivate this immortal part, that it&#xD;
may blossom with all the fascinations of a paradise, to equal,&#xD;
yea, surpass the most beautiful ideal that man is capable of&#xD;
forming of the .beauty, the loveliness, the glory of woman.&#xD;
Better that woman strive to make her person hideous in the&#xD;
eyes of man, than that she lure him by a false exterior that&#xD;
has no correspondence of beauty within, to a spiritual grave&#xD;
of death, in which are .shipwrecked all his beautiful hopes of&#xD;
life.&#xD;
Walter did not ask himself the question whether his affec-&#xD;
tion for Angeline was worthily placed. He did not care to be&#xD;
t oubled with such a disturbing query. He was too blinded in&#xD;
the joy of his own dream to think of that. He only knew&#xD;
that he loved the fair girl with the full strength of his soul.&#xD;
And what.was there to cast a shade of doubt, that this passion&#xD;
was genuine ?  Was not the girl very beautiful?  Was there&#xD;
&#xD;
not in her every feature and act something more than beauty,&#xD;
a certain captivating grace, that was irresistible in its fascinating&#xD;
power over him? Were not her parents enthroned in the respect&#xD;
and affection of the town ? Were not her grand-parents revered&#xD;
and beloved to a point of actual worship?  Added then to the&#xD;
personal charm of the fair girl herself, was the fascination of&#xD;
family position and influence. This element came in to deepen&#xD;
and strengthen his attachment to the object of his choice. It&#xD;
enlarged and elevated his happiness. It went, to satisfy that&#xD;
early aspiration of his youth for social preeminence, for&#xD;
climbing to some loftier and more noble sphere of existence.&#xD;
But such speculations were after all unworthy the purity of&#xD;
his sentiments for Angeline. His love for her-was independent&#xD;
of all mere worldly interest. The sweet power which she&#xD;
held over him was deep, irresistible, complete. He felt a&#xD;
happiness in her presence all absorbing, delicious. Her every&#xD;
look was a bright ray from heaven. Her transcendent image&#xD;
was ever before him in his waking hours, and gave splendor&#xD;
to his dreams by night. Her very foot-prints he gazed on&#xD;
with emotions of tenderness, and the slightest rustling of her&#xD;
dress sent a thrill of delight through his heart.&#xD;
Strange power of the human soul, that can first create a&#xD;
world of love, and then in a delirium of ecstasy rush blindly into&#xD;
its blissful waters. Thrice strange that having himself tasted&#xD;
this divinest emotion of earth, man should ever be willing to&#xD;
disown the loyal sentiment, as if ashamed of one of the purest&#xD;
feelings of-the human heart.&#xD;
Miss Redcliffe, as we have before said, was the worshipped&#xD;
queen of the village school. She instinctively drew forth the&#xD;
tender gallantry from the hearts of the older boys. Even&#xD;
the teacher could not always disguise a certain warmth of&#xD;
delicacy in addressing her. But the ingenuous soul of the&#xD;

252              THE FISHER BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
girl received this homage, but as another expression of that&#xD;
complacent love which she herself had ever felt for others, and&#xD;
whichshe was wont to receive from others in return. Feeling&#xD;
no exclusive interest in another being, she could not compre-&#xD;
hend that she merited particular attention from another.&#xD;
Thus the unsophisticated-girl, passed off the flattery bestowed&#xD;
upon her, with a coy grace, that but enhanced her worth in&#xD;
the eyes of the seeker.&#xD;
Walter's eye was quick to perceive this. True, Angeline&#xD;
had given him no especial token of her love. But then sure&#xD;
he felt, that she had neither yielded her heart to another. He&#xD;
at least stood equal in his fortune with other aspirants. - More&#xD;
than this, he had gathered some slight evidences of her par-&#xD;
tiality for him. The fond, eager heart catches at shadows.&#xD;
Then he could not but feel, that the' being gifted to fire his&#xD;
soul to such a glow of passion, must possess a nature congenial to&#xD;
his own ; that the beneficent Great Cause, ever harmonious in&#xD;
design, would not create a heart to awaken so intense a flame&#xD;
of affection in another, and yet remain insensible to the&#xD;
reciprocal exercise of those emotions in return. Indeed, he&#xD;
gradually came to persuade himself, that'he was to be the&#xD;
first, the only choice of the young girl. Blissful thought&#xD;
he felt this in its - calm, awakening force, which is itself&#xD;
the inspiration of love.&#xD;
In this sweet self-complacency, his richly freighted barque&#xD;
was being wafted delightfully upon the placid sea of hope. But&#xD;
an unseen gale was soon to spring up, that would toss the&#xD;
fragile vessel in phrenzied desperation.&#xD;

CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
"Foul jealousy ! that turnest love divine&#xD;
To joyless dread, and mak'st the loving heart,&#xD;
With hateful thoughts to languish and to pine,&#xD;
And feed itself with self-consuming smart ;&#xD;
Of all the passions-in the mind thou vilest art."&#xD;
SPENSER'S FAIRY QUEEN.&#xD;
IT was a dreary December night. The menacing storm at&#xD;
length broke forth, and the big rain-drops intermingled with&#xD;
sleet, came coursing to the earth in fierce, pitiless blasts.&#xD;
In a low, dilapidated cot, a mere hovel in respectability,&#xD;
might have been seen a wretched family, consisting of a couple&#xD;
of parents, and some seven of their unhappy progeny. These&#xD;
latter bore a shrivelled and melancholy look, that was painful&#xD;
to behold.&#xD;
The father with hair silvered, rather by hardship, than by age ;&#xD;
with teeth loosened rather by medicine, than by organic decay;&#xD;
with a soul crushed by domestic griefs, as well as by deep thrusts&#xD;
from the dark hand of fortune, exhibited, nevertheless, vestiges&#xD;
of a haughty spirit and an indomitable pride.&#xD;
The wife evinced no signs of physical decay. Yet her thin&#xD;
wiry frame, her nervous, startling motions, her sharp, bitter&#xD;
voice, her haggard wandering eye gave unmistakable evidence&#xD;
that the woman had felt deeply the storm of wrong, of mis-&#xD;
fortune, and suffering. Indeed, she was but the bitter concen-&#xD;
tration of her former strong nature.   Her ,life had been&#xD;
steeped in the ivormwood of unhappiness. Her soft traits had&#xD;
been crushed out, and what remained had been intensified and&#xD;
hardened into adamant.&#xD;
Three of the children were deaf mutes; one was lame from&#xD;
the fracture of a limb ; and upon all, want and misery were&#xD;
depicted in every lineament. Still, these offspring of misfor-&#xD;

&#xD;
tune possessed features of classic symetry, complexion of&#xD;
rare purity and a native vivacity, that bespoke them beings&#xD;
above the common mould. But their wine of life had been&#xD;
turned to gall, through the mildew blast of a cursed home.&#xD;
Bleared-eyed jealousy on the part of the father, and domes-&#xD;
tic incapacity of the mother overlapped by ill-success in busi-&#xD;
ness, were the.principle causes of their wretchedness.&#xD;
And yet the morn of their marriage union shone serenely.&#xD;
They belonged to two of the wealthiest -and most respect-&#xD;
able families of the town. They were endowed by nature&#xD;
with surpassing beauty of person, and striking intelligence.&#xD;
Education had graciously dispensed to them more than her&#xD;
wont.&#xD;
Thus at the outset of their voyage, all seemed to bespeak&#xD;
prosperity and happiness. But they seemed to have launched&#xD;
their barque upon the receding wave, and the treacherous&#xD;
waters had left them a strand upon the shore of life.&#xD;
The howling storm increased. A blast of sleet brought a&#xD;
shudder to the heart of Mrs. Leeland.&#xD;
" Where can Isadore be, that she does not return," exclaimed&#xD;
the mother in a tone of deep anxiety. " She has been absent from&#xD;
home now these three. days. I fear something dreadful may&#xD;
have overtaken the poor child. 'T is an awful night this, to be&#xD;
out exposed." She added, after a moment's pause, "4 Oh, if&#xD;
we could only break her up from this strange way she has of&#xD;
roaming off, nobody knows whither ! By and by we shell hear&#xD;
of the death of the poor thing."&#xD;
"Never fear any such chance, interrupted Mr. Leeland, in a&#xD;
sarcastic tone. Did ye not know the devil to be always in&#xD;
luck ; I never saw a drunken person catch any hurt in falling.&#xD;
I make no doubt some good fellow will pick the girl up at&#xD;
the right time. Ah, she 's only following, I tell you, the wake&#xD;
of her blood."&#xD;
&#xD;
This last sentence was uttered with an ironic leer of the&#xD;
eye, and in a tone so bitter, as to arouse all the maternal in-&#xD;
stincts of Mrs. Leeland.&#xD;
"You 've no more feeling for your children than a brute,"&#xD;
retorted the incensed wife; "and if you had a drop of manly&#xD;
blood throbbing your bosom, you wouldn't thus insult the&#xD;
honor of your own child. What but your unmerciful cruelty&#xD;
first drove her from our door?"&#xD;
" More like 't was your cursed shiftlessness. Such miser-&#xD;
able housekeeping would drive a Hottentot from his own&#xD;
house. What a miserable apology have we here for a home;&#xD;
I 'd as soon go live with cannibals."&#xD;
During this tirade, Mrs. Leeland, goaded to the quick, was&#xD;
ready to launch again upon her husband with the force of a&#xD;
mad hyena. But at this moment the door opened, and Isadore,&#xD;
accompanied by a stalwart stranger, made her appearance.&#xD;
"Ah, how glad I am that you 've come-" exclaimed Mrs.&#xD;
Leeland, springing from her seat to welcome her daughter,&#xD;
"I was getting to be so worried about you, but here you are,&#xD;
safe, and heaven be praised."&#xD;
She hesitated going on, under a feeling of rebuke, in seeing&#xD;
her child in the company of a stranger. She felt that her&#xD;
husband would now have some plausible grounds for his bit-&#xD;
ing and ugly sarcasms.&#xD;
As for Mr. Leeland, had the same scene taken place, at&#xD;
some former period of his life, before he had quite lost all&#xD;
parental interest in his child, under the spell of his monomaic&#xD;
insanity, he would doubtless have fallen into a paroxyism&#xD;
of passion, that no human power could have withstood; but&#xD;
the tie of his paternal loyalty had been sundered, and he now&#xD;
shut himself up in dogged sullenness, awaiting a moment to&#xD;
spit out some taunting reproach.&#xD;
Isadore, in cast of feature, strongly resembled her other&#xD;

&#xD;
sisters. She was the eldest and the best looking of them, and&#xD;
during her childhood, possessed a face that was indeed very&#xD;
sweet and pretty. But now, although every trace of comeli-&#xD;
ness had not been driven from her person by the weird Fate&#xD;
that presided over her lot, yet all delicate expression of beauty&#xD;
seemed lost in her tall, gaunt form, her pale shrivelled feat-&#xD;
ures, that bore an unearthly expression, and in a certain&#xD;
awkward, abstracted air, that made her seem as if-some evil&#xD;
spirit had gotten possession of her.&#xD;
From the impulse of a generous heart, Isadore set to work&#xD;
in earnest, to assuage the ill-plight of her stranger guest. She&#xD;
drew him quickly up to the fire-place, which she replenished&#xD;
immediately from the scanty wood-pile of her home, and then&#xD;
ran for a change of clothing from her absent brother's ward-&#xD;
robe. Her mother at the same time set before him some&#xD;
coarse and ill-prepared refreshments.&#xD;
At. another time, Isadore might have hesitated in showing&#xD;
so much freedom toward a stranger, in presence of her father,&#xD;
but when the heart has become thoroughly aglow with kind-&#xD;
ness, it hurries the step beyond the line of cold reserve; and,&#xD;
in this case, the suffering girl had become too much used to&#xD;
the bitter tirades of the insensate, to heed them beyond meas-&#xD;
ure.&#xD;
As the stranger's stiffened limbs began to thaw, and his&#xD;
spirits to flow with warmth, his tongue likewise became loos-&#xD;
ened, and he broke forth into the following exordium:--&#xD;
"May the all gracious Heaven forever bless you, my dear&#xD;
angel of mercy, for thus taking pity upon a desolate wanderer,&#xD;
like me, up and down this cold bleak earth. I had about&#xD;
forsworn all good will toward human kind, having always&#xD;
come off so badly at the hands of the land-pirates ; but this&#xD;
sweet, kindly act of yours brings back, I must confess, a spark&#xD;
of the love of olden times."&#xD;
&#xD;
At the word love, the slumbering jealousy of Mr. Leeland&#xD;
took fire.&#xD;
" Love the girl, eh?  She must have a wholesome taste to&#xD;
pick up for a lover such a broken down hack as you are."&#xD;
Old Marl, for it was no other than the old sailor himself,&#xD;
had not before noticed Mr. Leeland. But at the sound of&#xD;
his voice he cast a glance backward, when their eyes met.&#xD;
"What say you there ?" demanded the salt in a gruff&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
"I say," reiterated the father, his whole frame firing up&#xD;
with intense energy, " I say the girl must have a wholesome&#xD;
taste to be taken up with such a vagabond as you appear,&#xD;
Mr. Marl, looking as if you had been drawn through the&#xD;
devil's cesspool."&#xD;
" And is it against that young woman that you hold such&#xD;
language," retorted the sailor, rising quickly from his seat, his&#xD;
eyes rolling with fury. "If you shall-dare breathe a syllable&#xD;
against her fair honor, I'll make you eat your own words so&#xD;
quick that you '11 not know that you 've done it."&#xD;
"Insult tne in my own house, eh, you wretch," and&#xD;
springing from his seat, he struck the sailor such a blow with&#xD;
a chair, as sent the stool in fragments upon the floor.&#xD;
Quick as thought, Marl grappled his antagonist by the&#xD;
throat, and in the paroxyism of his anger, might have dam-&#xD;
aged Mr. Leeland irreparably, but for the filial tenderness of&#xD;
Isadore, who rushed between them, beseeching the sailor in&#xD;
heaven's name to spare her father. At -the word father,' the&#xD;
sailor's hand relaxed, and turning towards the girl with a look&#xD;
of utter astonishment.-.&#xD;
"Your father, and can it be possible ! A thousand pardons I&#xD;
beg for my roughness. Upon my word, had I known this&#xD;
man to be your father, I would have suffered a thousand deaths,&#xD;

&#xD;
rather than have laid the weight of my finger in anger upon&#xD;
his body."&#xD;
"After what has happened, I cannot tarry longer under your&#xD;
hospitality. Go from here, I must, though it takes me to find&#xD;
a bed in the veriest slough of your bleak shores. But first&#xD;
let me tell you, man, how it came, that capricious fortune&#xD;
threw me among you at all; in order that you may have no&#xD;
reason to harbor an unkind thought against this sweet damsel&#xD;
who is an honor to her sex.&#xD;
" Well, you must know that some freak of my poor brain&#xD;
sent me on a fishing voyage, in one of your craft last sum-&#xD;
mer. The season 'over, following the bent of my roaming&#xD;
spirit, which is about as tranquil as the dancing spray of&#xD;
Niagara, I was led to make a trip south in one of your&#xD;
schooners. It was a little dubious coming on the coast, at this&#xD;
icy season of the year, but I've become somewhat accustomed&#xD;
to the gusts of this breezy planet. We had the good luck&#xD;
of making land early yesterday morning, and of tying our&#xD;
craft snugly up in your harbor, before the lowering tempest&#xD;
that had been muttering for two or three days in the sky&#xD;
broke forth in its spite.&#xD;
" On getting ashore, while the rest of the crew set blithely&#xD;
out for their several homes, I declined all their hearty invi-&#xD;
tations to go along with them, and started confidently alone to&#xD;
find the house of a youngster who was one of our number&#xD;
aboard the Pink last summer. He lives .somewhere in these&#xD;
parts. To confess, I had gotten up an affection for the lad&#xD;
while we were together. Somehow he won upon my good&#xD;
will prodigiously. If I mistake not, he is a noble hearted&#xD;
fellow, and possesses a larger share of the sweet grace of life,&#xD;
than falls to the lot of humanity in general. At any rate I&#xD;
was disposed to give way to my inclinations and seek out the&#xD;
&#xD;
young man. But a sailor upon a strange shore of a dark tem-&#xD;
pestuous night, is about in the same plight as would be a land-&#xD;
lubber among the reefs of Florida. Suffice it to say, I found&#xD;
the navigation befogging enough to my salt water brain, and&#xD;
after winding about for a time, amid the mazes of my phantom&#xD;
perceptions, I at length brought up in the thicket of some crazy&#xD;
swamp. And while veering and tacking there like a muddy&#xD;
pated loon, beset by a score of guns, I fell suddenly plump into&#xD;
a big nasty mud-hole. Here I was in imminent danger of&#xD;
foundering my bewildered barque ; and after crossing the At-&#xD;
lantic more times than can be counted on one's fingers and toes,&#xD;
might have seen myself in the sorry predicament of shuffling&#xD;
off my mortal coil, in this wretched situation, but for a sweet,&#xD;
gentle voice that glimmered up through the murky air, like&#xD;
blessed hope amid a tempest. It fell upon my ear, I imagine,&#xD;
like seraphic music upon the heavenward winged soul ! What&#xD;
was my surprise to find the voice proceeded from a woman.&#xD;
With much ado the  entle creature helped extricate me from&#xD;
my wo-begone situation, and lead me safely to her warm home.&#xD;
How much do I not owe to this young woman!&#xD;
"More, it seems to me, than to any human being, save my own&#xD;
blessed mother. No loving sister could have shown a forlorn&#xD;
brother more tenderness. No devoted wife could have given&#xD;
stronger proof of her fidelity to a world forsaken husband.&#xD;
No doating mother could have shown greater alacrity in res-&#xD;
cuing a fond son in peril. Believe me, that young woman&#xD;
possesses largely the milk of human kindness. Beneath the&#xD;
guise of fragile woman, she bears a lion's spirit, for in the&#xD;
most perilous and trying scenes that I have passed through,&#xD;
never have I seen the boldest comrade exhibit amore cool&#xD;
and dauntless bravery, than she did in rescuing me from my&#xD;
danger. How little should we know where to. seek a true&#xD;
loyal human heart. I had about given over woman-kind as&#xD;

them all now, and pray for them till the latest breath of my&#xD;
existence, if but to honor this noble example of her sex.&#xD;
May the gracious heaven forever bless you, my dear girl."&#xD;
With this last sentence the old sailor, under the sway of&#xD;
a visible emotion sauntered toward the door-way, with an evi-&#xD;
dent movement for departing, but suddenly arresting his steps&#xD;
as if checked by a sudden thought, he exclaimed :&#xD;
" The lad's name was Walter Carl. May be you happen to&#xD;
know him, and can set me on the way to his house."'&#xD;
At the words Walter Carl, the blood mounted to the cheeks&#xD;
of Isadore, her breast heaved with evident emotion, and she&#xD;
subsided into a seat, near, covering her face with her hands, as&#xD;
if to disguise the feelings that agitated her frame.&#xD;
The sailor gazed upon the spectacle with consternation, but&#xD;
feeling that his-presence might aggravate the perplexity, he&#xD;
hastened to the door-way, and abruptly took his leave.&#xD;

"Trifles, light as air,&#xD;
Are to the jealous, confirmations strong&#xD;
As proofs of holy writ. "-S AKs. OTHELLO.&#xD;
ALTHOUGH at the beginning of the winter school, life flowed&#xD;
serenely, yet ripples ere long began to break forth upon the&#xD;
gliding stream. The feeling o; envy, that leaving his own&#xD;
school for that at the~ Old Parish, had engendered among&#xD;
Walter's former school-mates, only waxed stronger with the&#xD;
lapse of time. He and his two comrades had become stigma-&#xD;
tized as traitors to their own school, and were exposed to sun-&#xD;
dry such petty annoyances, by the pestering spirit of their&#xD;
former associates. This was well calculated to ruffle the&#xD;
equanimity of the trio. It fell with peculiar force upon Wal-.&#xD;
ter, who for the first time in his life, found himself becoming&#xD;
unpopular. It grieved him sorely at the heart.  The first&#xD;
symptoms of having drawn upon ourselves the displeasure of&#xD;
others, with what withering keenness it strikes the pure sensi-&#xD;
tive soul!&#xD;
One evening, a few days after a great fall of snow, as&#xD;
Walter and his two companions were wending their way&#xD;
homeward, from school, they very unexpectedly encountered a&#xD;
huge ridge of snow stretched across their pathway. In its&#xD;
altitude, it assumed the character of a formidable breast-work.&#xD;
Behind this Sebastopol were snugly ensconced some dozen or&#xD;
more warlike spirits, ready to dispute any attempt at breach-&#xD;
ing a passage. The three boys were too proud-spirited to give&#xD;
in and sue for a passage, nor were they disposed to show&#xD;

&#xD;
themselves so pusillanimous as to fall back, and so -reach&#xD;
home by a circuitous route.&#xD;
Balec, the oldest of the three, was an iron-framed, hard-&#xD;
fisted fellow, and as tough as the pine knots of his native&#xD;
woods.   He ' was moreover awkward-gaited and clumsy-&#xD;
mannered, and might as likely as not stumble over his own&#xD;
shadow ; but once let his ire become aroused, and woe to the&#xD;
unlucky wight that should fall into his sinewy-paws.  His&#xD;
grip had the force of a vice, and as unrelenting.&#xD;
Jabez, the next, was a perfect leopard in strength and&#xD;
agility. His body partook of the litheness of the adder,&#xD;
united with the power of the boa-constrictor. The force, of&#xD;
two beings seemed to have been concentrated in his own frame,&#xD;
and his spirit and courage were in a corresponding large&#xD;
measure. His father before him had been reckoned a giant,&#xD;
in strength, and Jabez was no unworthy son of his sire.&#xD;
No boy .of his age could stand before him in contest for a&#xD;
moment, and many a person of ripe age was obliged to succumb&#xD;
whenever there was a struggle for the mastery.&#xD;
Walter could boast of less physical prowess than either of&#xD;
the other _two boys, but he had received a considerable&#xD;
development of muscle, and he possessed a spirit, which when&#xD;
once fairly aroused, did not easily flinch.&#xD;
Thus, with strong confidence in their mutual superiority,&#xD;
they entertained no thought of yielding without a trial. They&#xD;
accordingly prepared for the onset. Pulling well down over&#xD;
their heads their Scotch caps, they bolted forward upon a run&#xD;
in single file. But on striking the line of breast-work, they&#xD;
were so fiercely greeted with a shower of snow-balls as to&#xD;
become overwhelmed with momentary blindness, which caused&#xD;
them to stagger back for a moment's respite.&#xD;
They next essayed to turn one of the corners of the snow-&#xD;
&#xD;
line,~but the whole posse of opposition pounced upon them&#xD;
and compelled them to fall back.&#xD;
They now determined to break the line, when they found&#xD;
themselves in a hand to hand struggle, walloping over and&#xD;
under in the snow, in smothering confusion. In lively conflict&#xD;
more than one felt the grip of Balec, or was compelled to cry&#xD;
for quarter, by Jabez.  Although the spirit of opposition&#xD;
began to wane in force, yet by dint of numbers they still main-&#xD;
tained their ground.&#xD;
It was now nearly night. Indeed, the dusky shades were&#xD;
gathering around them. Suddenly a stream   of water was&#xD;
seen to issue from a woody thicket near. It struck the centre&#xD;
of the ridgy line of snow, which disappeared rapidly under&#xD;
its melting force. A boy of the opposition impelled by curi-&#xD;
osity rushed toward it, when he received the watery spout&#xD;
full upon his person. It set him into a frenzy of gyrations,&#xD;
and he jumped about as if shot with a charge of pepper and&#xD;
salt. Several others advanced, but shared only too well the&#xD;
same fate. Perceiving they had a new enemy to encounter&#xD;
they disbanded, and hastened on their way. Walter and his&#xD;
companions now proceeded homeward; but as they were&#xD;
turning an angle of their pathway, Walter was seized with&#xD;
a curiosity to mount upon a high post standing near, and&#xD;
cast his eyes in the direction whence issued the niysterious&#xD;
stream of water. As his eyes wandered about the thicket in&#xD;
the distance, they suddenly fell upon a female, figure. She&#xD;
was standing near the trunk of an oak, in an abstracted air,&#xD;
with face partially averted.  He gazed at the unknown a&#xD;
moment, feeling certain that he had seen the figure before,&#xD;
but when and where he could not recall. He rushed on after&#xD;
his comrades, but the image of the female he- had just seen,&#xD;
lingered long in his mind. The feeling it excited was not of&#xD;
personal interest, but that of strange curiosity.&#xD;

A DREAMY VISION.           265&#xD;
&#xD;
How often there hangs upon some trivial incident, a mo-&#xD;
mentous turn in the career of our fate ! One evening, on his&#xD;
way home from school, Walter happily bethought himself of&#xD;
having inadvertently left his speaking-book behind. He was&#xD;
too ambitious to risk a failure in declamation, and accordingly&#xD;
set out quickly in return, in order to repair the delinquency.&#xD;
On coming near the school-house, he was pleasantly surprised&#xD;
by hearing musical sounds. They seemed to glide upon his&#xD;
ear, through the still, soft air of twilight, in melodious cadence.&#xD;
His step was intuitively arrested, as if it were profanity to&#xD;
break the sweet harmony. The clear, pure voice, he recog-&#xD;
nized at once, as not unfamiliar to him ; and as the warbling&#xD;
intonations swelled out into a silvery, joyous pathos, they&#xD;
excited his emotional nature to a pitch of rapture not to be&#xD;
described. Reaching the school-house, he clambered up an&#xD;
old fence, that ran by a window, and stole al eager glance&#xD;
upon the musical party within. The first form that his&#xD;
searching eye seized, was that of Angeline. She was sitting&#xD;
in a back seat, with a psalm-book before her, from which she&#xD;
was rehearsing, in preparation for the evening's singing-school.&#xD;
Near and around her were several of her school-mates, both&#xD;
boys and girls, participating in the inspiring exercise. They&#xD;
all seemed in a happy frame of mind, as if the )ulse of life&#xD;
was beating sweetly within. Each ever and anon became the&#xD;
recipient of some delicate courtesy, on the part of the other,&#xD;
but the queen, toward whom universal homage flowed, was, as&#xD;
usual, the fair Angeline. The rest seeied to press around&#xD;
her person with unaffected gladness, and to catch a new light&#xD;
of joy from her presence.&#xD;
Walter gazed upon the scene in mute rapture. He swal-&#xD;
lowed slowly his delicious sensations. He felt sure that he&#xD;
had not seen the fair girl of his heart look half so beautiful&#xD;
before. A soft, delicate flush suffused her countenance, that&#xD;
&#xD;
imparted a peerless tint to her fine complexion. It seemed&#xD;
the bright rays of a glorious dawn mantling with celestial radi-&#xD;
ance, the azure heavens. Her bosom softly swelled and trem-&#xD;
bled as if in a giddy entrancement of some- perennial joy.&#xD;
Her eyes by turns glowed with a melting tenderness, and then&#xD;
were lit up with a seraphic fire. It was the glowing inspira-&#xD;
tion of her singing, mingled with the sweet beatitude of feel-&#xD;
ing complacently beloved, that so transformed the girl's&#xD;
beauty into a loveliness supernal. But to the enrapturing&#xD;
eye of Walter, the vision before him seemed like the spirit&#xD;
of some dream, too fair for earth. In the language of&#xD;
Byron:--&#xD;
"lHe gazed and turned away, he knew not where,&#xD;
Dazzled and drunk with beauty, till the heart&#xD;
Reeled with its fulness."&#xD;
As we have already narrated, Walter loved Angeline at&#xD;
sight. The ray of passion'that shot athwart the sympathetic&#xD;
chord of his breast, was not less instantaneous than the answer-&#xD;
ing touch of the electric wire. Yet time in her society had&#xD;
revealed qualities which deepened this firsf sentiment. Among&#xD;
these, and not the least, was the rich chorus of her voice.&#xD;
Angeline was by eminence the village songstress.   Others&#xD;
among her fair companions could sing, but none like her.&#xD;
When her voice was heard in melody, others were eclipsed,&#xD;
as the stars veil their faces before the glorious eye of day.&#xD;
She had attended to singing as a science, with the best advan-&#xD;
tages her native place afforded, but her melody was not mere&#xD;
intellectuality of expression, not stiff, studied art, but tones of&#xD;
natural accord flowing from the soul, a spontaneous gushing&#xD;
from the founts of nature, as the crystal stream oozes up from&#xD;
the pearly depths below. Her voice was clear, soft, melodi-&#xD;
ous; now  lit up with a smile, 1now shadowed by a tear,&#xD;

266               THE FISHER BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
varied with the changing feeling of the moment. Her music&#xD;
seemed the voice of love.&#xD;
"Music !--0 how faint, how weak,&#xD;
Language fades before thy spell.&#xD;
Why should feeling ever speak&#xD;
When thou canst breath her soul so well."&#xD;
MOoRE.&#xD;
Her silvery voice was always foremost in the church choir,&#xD;
and at the singing school; and during the recesses and noon-&#xD;
ings of the winter school, snatches of 'melody would here and&#xD;
there jet out from the wealth of her soul, like gleams of golden&#xD;
sunshine from the bursting, fleecy heavens. It was in such&#xD;
magical moments, that these breathing impulses of the soul,&#xD;
thrown off with the most unaffected, coyest grace, made the&#xD;
deepest impressions upon his heart. He drank in the stealing&#xD;
accents, as the- first wild bird that drinks the dew from the&#xD;
violets of spring. It warmed to flow the vital flood of his&#xD;
heart, and waked its folded buds to joyous blossoming.&#xD;
What power is there not in the music of the human voice !&#xD;
With what a force of charm do not its sweet tender accents&#xD;
fall upon the loving, susceptible heart of youth. Ah, wonian !&#xD;
what magic gifts are not thine ! With what ease canst thou&#xD;
not glide into the affections of man, and mould his sensibilities&#xD;
to thy will!&#xD;
While thus gazing with unalloyed happiness, he was led to&#xD;
notice a young man, taller than the others, standing near&#xD;
Angeline, whose attentions seemed to partake of an earnest&#xD;
partiality. A vague trembling of heart arose at the suspicion.&#xD;
He scrutinized with anxious eye to see if these attentions were&#xD;
reciprocated by the fair girl. In the honesty of his heart, he&#xD;
could not discover that they were. Still, the warm courtesies&#xD;
of the young man gave him much uneasiness. A sensation&#xD;
&#xD;
such as he had never before experienced embittered his heart.&#xD;
The sweet tranquillity that he had before enjoyed, was all at&#xD;
once flown. The bright star that had beamed so richly upon&#xD;
him, had all at once sunk beneath the horizon of his soul. In&#xD;
its place was left a green, sepulchral light, that grew more&#xD;
and more wan.&#xD;
The company within the school-room, began now moving to&#xD;
come away ; and Walter, in order not to be noticed, descended,&#xD;
and quietly retreated homeward.&#xD;
The night hung heavily in the sacred interests of his heart.&#xD;
It was the first pang in the crucifixion of his heretofore pure&#xD;
love existence, and the anguish he experienced rent his gentle&#xD;
spirit. It fell like a blight upon his warm, generous hopes.&#xD;
ie tossed during the night upon his pillow, in feverish dis-&#xD;
quietude. le nursed the ill-starred offspring of his jaundiced&#xD;
imagination, until it overtopped his spirit like the craven&#xD;
nightmare.&#xD;
Yet, when serene morning dawned afresh, and he again&#xD;
sallied forth for school, in the vivifying air of heaven, he&#xD;
felt the sinister progeny of his brain to have fled, and his&#xD;
elastic spirit welcomed the wonted tone of his emotions. Still&#xD;
more, when he met at the school-room the angelic smile, the&#xD;
kindly tone, the cordial manner of Angeline, he felt it impos-&#xD;
sible that she could ever have thought of another, and he&#xD;
almost cursed the feeling that made him suspect a being so&#xD;
pure, so incapable of disappointing the fondest wish of his&#xD;
heart.&#xD;
Yet, after' the first reaction of this noble impulse, there&#xD;
would occasionally arise in his breast, after all, a twinge of&#xD;
doubt. Slight circumstances in the manner of Angeline were&#xD;
distorted to his predjuice, and at times he felt very unhappy.&#xD;
He at length resolved to test his doubts. A thought as to&#xD;
the way, luckily came to his mind. He had received during&#xD;

OVERSHOOTING THE MARK.        269&#xD;
&#xD;
the winter many pressing invitations to be present at their&#xD;
evening singing-schools. Angeline, in her own artless way,&#xD;
had more than once joined her entreaties with the rest. He&#xD;
had always declined these, assigning as a reason the incon-&#xD;
venience of the distance, but really, perhaps, from the emnbar-&#xD;
rassment one feels, in being present with equals at an exer-&#xD;
cise in which he cannot participate. But now, under the&#xD;
warmth of his new grown purpose, all scruples melted at once.&#xD;
He would accept the very next invitation, that he might satisfy&#xD;
the unworthy suspicion whether or not there existed a mutual&#xD;
sentiment between Angeline and the young man who had&#xD;
awakened his jealousy on the evening of the rehersal. He&#xD;
would - be able, he fancied, to determine as to the truth of his&#xD;
suspicions, by observing intently their mutual bearing. For-&#xD;
tune, that seemed guiding his fate, very soon threw an oppor-&#xD;
tunity in his path. One noon, while speaking of the singing-&#xD;
school, Angeline coquetishly reprimanded .Walter for slight-&#xD;
ing all their invitations to attend. " The boy, with a boldness&#xD;
he had never before shown in presence of the fair girl, pleas-&#xD;
antly retorted that he would be pleased to atone for his&#xD;
neglect, and that further he should be most happy to accom-&#xD;
pany Miss Angeline to the very next meeting. There was&#xD;
quite a little congratulatory outburst at this announcement, so&#xD;
unexpected.&#xD;
It was a lovely moon-light evening that Walter set out to&#xD;
call upon Angeline, and go to the singing-school. His feelings&#xD;
were elate. A happiness was to be his, that he could hardly.&#xD;
have dreamed of, as coming so soon. He was to be in the&#xD;
company of his beloved alone, towalk intimately by her side, to&#xD;
feel the sweet, gentle weight of her person upon his arm, in the&#xD;
hush of evening, when the shades of night could hide the&#xD;
blush of a too intimate word. Happy anticipation !&#xD;
On a moment's reflection, however, he perceived that lie was&#xD;
&#xD;
acting rather from the dubious suggestions of his own heart,&#xD;
than following the sweet will of Angeline. It was not she that&#xD;
had graciously solicited his company, as the craving of her&#xD;
voluntary will, but he from motives of unworthy suspicion,&#xD;
had devised the ,step. This feeling'°troubled him greatly : it&#xD;
engendered a pang of remorse. It disturbed the purity of the&#xD;
sentiment his heart so loved to entertain toward the single&#xD;
object of his love.&#xD;
Then how was he to secure the end he had proposed to&#xD;
himself, of determining whether the heart of the young girl&#xD;
was intact, or at least that her affections had been bestowed&#xD;
upon no other. If he had contrived to drop in upon the&#xD;
singing-school, at the Old Hall, unexpected and unobserved,&#xD;
there would have been a chance to satisfy his doubts. He&#xD;
could at least have watched her deportment, unseen. But&#xD;
as it was, being her engaged partner for the evening, the&#xD;
commonest courtesy would keep him near her, and exclude&#xD;
the attentions of others. The thought perplexed him. He&#xD;
felt abashed at his own short-sighted simplicity. He per-&#xD;
ceived how following a too ardent impulse, he had overshot his&#xD;
mark, and he at once foresaw that he was going thus&#xD;
early to be smartly punished for his departure from the path&#xD;
of manly trust. He had not learned that the way of the&#xD;
transgressor is hard ; and that in the affairs of the heart, as&#xD;
in the business of life, he is apt to cut but a sorry figure, who&#xD;
deviates from the road of wonted integrity.&#xD;
But these wan lights of feeling soon burned up with a&#xD;
brighter glow. Was he not to possess for the evening, the&#xD;
young girl's society ?  The sweet thought gradually gained&#xD;
empire in his bosom, and banished all dark bodings. A&#xD;
jealous man is wont to gain confidence in the presence of his&#xD;
love. The- sunshine of her person dissipates the cloud of&#xD;

DISAPPOINTED LOVE.           271&#xD;
&#xD;
suspicion, and he feels but too happy in the joy of the&#xD;
present.&#xD;
He at length reached the home of Angeline. A maid in,&#xD;
response to his gentle rap, appeared at the door. With falter-&#xD;
ing voice, he enquired for Miss Redcliff.&#xD;
"She has been gone this half hour, to the singing school, "&#xD;
replied the girl, with a tone of indifference.&#xD;
"Gone !" repeated Walter in astonishment.&#xD;
" Yes, with Charles Raymond."&#xD;
" Gone with Charles Raymond !" exclaimed the agitated&#xD;
boy, as a pang of phrenzy shot up from the depths of his soul.&#xD;
"Yes, he comes here to call for her quite often."&#xD;
Walter, at this intelligence, was struck, as may be supposed,&#xD;
with utter consternation.  Bitter jealousy, wounded pride,&#xD;
and indignation at the treatment he had received, seized by&#xD;
turns his breast, and then mingled in one overpowering feeling&#xD;
of deep anguish.&#xD;
But the overmastering stroke of all, was the dark distrust&#xD;
- which her apparent conduct had ushered in upon his soul,&#xD;
like the deepest gloom of night ; that pure, divine faith he&#xD;
had conceived in her unfaltering integrity shaken to its lowest&#xD;
foundation, and the whole superstructure of her beautiful&#xD;
perfections, that fancy had woven thereupon, crumbled to&#xD;
atoms, and melted like the baseless fabric of a dream.&#xD;
Underlying Walter's fervent love for Angeline was his sure&#xD;
trust in her truthfulness of spirit. He felt this to be the&#xD;
golden cement of all her graces. If his bright imagination&#xD;
had decked her image in all the charms of his own susceptible&#xD;
heart, his sincere, earnest nature would fain have her as beau-&#xD;
tifully perfect in the larger virtues of an unshaken character.&#xD;
In his exacting conception of her perfectness, she was without&#xD;
crack or flaw. The circle was not more complete in its&#xD;
&#xD;
symetrical roundness ; the spheres not more harmonious in&#xD;
their sublime evolutions ; nature not less deviating in its&#xD;
silent, profound exactness ; nor the eternal laws less changing&#xD;
in the hand of omniscient power. Indeed, all these grand&#xD;
elements of the universe might be changed by the wise Law-&#xD;
giver, but how could there be change in this pure, blissful&#xD;
object of his finest creation. No, she was pure, good, incor-&#xD;
ruptible ; incapable of deception or of change.  Whatever&#xD;
might be his own fortune in securing the affections of Angeline,&#xD;
he could have no doubt of the native trueness of her soul.&#xD;
On this point, he could lay his head upon the pillow of her&#xD;
.trusting soul, and sleep on in sweet, confiding repose, for-&#xD;
ever.&#xD;
Then how great was the shock of the flashing note that told&#xD;
him that she had left him, and her plighted word, and gone&#xD;
with another. To what a deep of depths it thrust the bright&#xD;
vision of his hopes ! How it struck out from his pure heaven&#xD;
all the glorious dreams of his future. How it paralyzed the&#xD;
tongue of his energies ! Into what abject distress it pros-&#xD;
trated his whole nature.&#xD;
Ah, how beautiful is that sweet, trustful love of the pure&#xD;
youthful heart in the perfection of woman. She lights before&#xD;
his radiant eyes, the brightest vision of earth, resplendent in&#xD;
the peerless charms of her outward form, and incomparably&#xD;
fascinating in the matchless graces that animate it. The&#xD;
magic, mystic tie of sex exalts in the imagination of man, all&#xD;
these native outward graces with which nature has en-&#xD;
robed her, to a bloom of inexpressible beauty. In this state,&#xD;
the fond, believing heart, assigns a corresponding perfection to&#xD;
all the attributes of the souL  It cannot be doubted that what&#xD;
is so lovely to the eye, must be correspondingly so to the&#xD;
mind and to the heart. Any other thought would be sacrilege,&#xD;
profanity. Alas ! that he should come later to learn, that the&#xD;

ILL BODINGS DiSSIPATED.       _273&#xD;
&#xD;
sweetest joys are often the most fleeting, that the most precious&#xD;
objects of sense are often the most perishable, and that the&#xD;
most beautiful, the most lovely creature of nature, the perfec-&#xD;
tion of nature's glorious handiwork, may be the weakest, the&#xD;
frailest thing of earth.&#xD;
Walter retraced his, steps in a state of mind more easily&#xD;
conceived than expressed. At times the girl's image would&#xD;
rise in his heart, in all her wonted fascination, and a sweet&#xD;
tongue within would plead her innocence, on the ground of&#xD;
some misunderstanding ; then a feeling of bitterness would&#xD;
spring up, obliterating all the hopeful wishes.&#xD;
His way took him directly by the singing Hall. As he&#xD;
came abreast the Church Grave Yard, which was only on the&#xD;
opposite side of the road to the Hall, he stopped a few&#xD;
moments, hesitating whether to go in, or proceed on his&#xD;
way home, He could hear the choral voices, issuing from the&#xD;
hallowed building, and his heart palpitated with strong emotion,&#xD;
at the inspiring sounds. The moon was full up in the heavens.&#xD;
Fleecy shreds of clouds were scudding fleetly over her silvery&#xD;
disc, creating the illusion of rapid motion, on the part of the&#xD;
celestial queen herself. Indeed, she seemed to Walter to be&#xD;
hurrying across the arch of the sky, in order to dart off into&#xD;
illimitable space, and thus be rid of the unhappiness of earth.&#xD;
He would fain join her train, and be ushered into the regions&#xD;
of chaos. Turning toward the precints of the slumbering&#xD;
dead, a feeling of awe crept over his spirit. The shadows of&#xD;
the moon flitting across the gravestones and the straggling&#xD;
shrubbery, seemed like shades hovering in grief over the de-&#xD;
parted. His own affections, too, might be buried in a grave&#xD;
as deep.&#xD;
While thus musing, a slight rustling. caused by the wind&#xD;
among the branches of an old elm near, drew his attention&#xD;
thither. In a moment his roving eye fell upon a female form&#xD;
&#xD;
near. She was standing partially concealed by a mossy slab,&#xD;
her eyes gazing wistfully in the heavens. As a gleam from&#xD;
the moon lit up her face, he felt sure of having seen the coun-&#xD;
tenance before, but now there was a pallid expression fastened&#xD;
there, that made him shrink with awe. A few trembling mo-&#xD;
ments elapsed, before he could shake off the superstitious fear&#xD;
that had seized him, sufficiently to move from the spot to which&#xD;
he seemed rooted. But gaining at length the better of his&#xD;
weakness, he walked boldly toward the apparition, which&#xD;
glided rapidly away, as he approached, and soon disappeared&#xD;
entirely, as if dissolving into the surrounding air.&#xD;
Under the trepidation excited by this casual incident, he&#xD;
decided to go into the singing school. On entering, whom&#xD;
should his enquiring glance first meet, but the bright face of&#xD;
Angeline. The fair girl was fully under the inspiring glow of&#xD;
singing. As her eye met Walter's, a bright carnation man-&#xD;
tled her cheeks, that added a still deeper. richness to her&#xD;
beauty. Indeed, she looked to Walter inexpressibly lovely.&#xD;
For the moment, all his bodings flew as upon winged' steeds;&#xD;
and a tranquil joy swelled through his breast that was mo-&#xD;
mentary happiness.&#xD;
When the exercises broke up, Walter, under the impulse of&#xD;
his haughty spirit, was proceeding to go directly home.  But&#xD;
an acquaintance whom he met there for the first time, after a&#xD;
long absence, held him apart awhile in welcome interview.&#xD;
The rest of the company meanwhile ebbed out of the room&#xD;
slowly, as if held back by the lingering spell of song. Ange-&#xD;
line was among the very last to leave, making apparently a&#xD;
pretext for tarrying, by humming over the tunes given out for&#xD;
the next week's meeting. Yet she evinced an embarrased and&#xD;
impatient air. The quick eye of Walter noticed this, but he&#xD;
was at loss to divine its cause. At length, as Walter was&#xD;
moving to go out, Angeline herself cloaked and hooded for the&#xD;

&#xD;
wintry air, brushed by him, near enough for a mutual recogni-&#xD;
tion. Charles Raymond followed after her,.and as he came&#xD;
up on the stair-way, solicited the favor of accompanying her&#xD;
home. But Walter was filled with surprise to hear the girl&#xD;
respectfully but firmly decline. An irresistible emotion im-&#xD;
pelled him to follow after them. In the street, , Charles&#xD;
repeated his solicitation to Angeline, which was the second&#xD;
time declined, yet he clung to the girl's side, as if destitute of&#xD;
the commonest sentiment of courtesy. At this outrage upon&#xD;
manliness, Walter's soul boiled with shame. He walked up,&#xD;
and addressed Angeline, more as a protector, than a rival.&#xD;
She accepted with evident gladness, and even nestled to his&#xD;
side, as if with a sense of security from annoying intrusion.&#xD;
Charles still followed after for some distance, then approached&#xD;
and bidding Angeline good evening, in a most awkward man-&#xD;
ner, slunk away homeward.&#xD;
It was a happiness as unexpected, as keen, to find himself&#xD;
alone by the side of Angeline, her accepted companion. The&#xD;
unspeakable delight at first fettered his tongue, and filled his&#xD;
every movement with ungainliness. Yet, the girl's going off&#xD;
with Charles, and thus breaking her engagement to him, was&#xD;
an incident enshrouded in a good deal of mystery. But a&#xD;
few simple words from her pure lips cleared that up. In&#xD;
Walter's invitation, the expression ran, that he would see her&#xD;
to the singing school, intending to convey the idea of calling&#xD;
for her at her father's, while she took it to mean, meeting her&#xD;
at the Hall, and thence seeing her home. The ambiguity of&#xD;
the phrase was the occasion of the mistake, in which Walter&#xD;
confessed himself at once at fault.  Her going with Charles&#xD;
was on her part, a mere neighborly courtesy. She could not&#xD;
have avoided it without being rude.&#xD;
The sands of time in the Winter's school had nearly run&#xD;
out. The teacher conceived it desirable to close up with an&#xD;
&#xD;
exhibition of his school, that, while it should show the pupils'&#xD;
progress, would at the same -time, serve to embalm in their&#xD;
breasts, his winter's labors. Walter and Angeline, with the&#xD;
rest, took a conspicuous part. This brought them much to-&#xD;
gether, and under very agreeable circumstances. But each&#xD;
preserved toward the other a delicate reserve, often reaching&#xD;
to an embarrassment that betrayed their mutual interests, and&#xD;
fanned the flame they strove in vain to conceal.&#xD;
Yet toward the other boys, Angeline was the same coy,&#xD;
blithesome, graceful being, as at the commencement of the&#xD;
school.&#xD;
Among the conceits that not uncommonly break out among&#xD;
scholars at school, was that started by some fanciful youth, of&#xD;
the boys' exchanging letters with the girls, at the close of the&#xD;
school. It was to assume the character of a parting memento.&#xD;
This sweet device, savoring quite of gallantry, contributed&#xD;
to swell the tender enthusiasm that had been ripening mutu-&#xD;
ally in the breast of the school. There was about it a tinge&#xD;
of delicate romance.  A  dreamy sentiment, a warm word&#xD;
could be dropped in these poetry-epistles of school affection&#xD;
that would paralize the tongue of bashful youth in conversa-&#xD;
tion. Ah, how sweet to youth is the fragrant breath of its&#xD;
own warm heart !&#xD;
Walter was to reciprocate billets with several of the girls,&#xD;
and among the rest,:with Angeline. After much pains-taking&#xD;
he succeeded in something that answered his taste, for the&#xD;
others, but when he came to Angeline, he felt greatly embar-&#xD;
rassed. He could not summon forth the sentiments that suited&#xD;
his feelings, and the choicest language he could command&#xD;
seemed too poor for her exquisite ear. He wished to express&#xD;
himself so as to portray 'the inspiration glowing in his soul,&#xD;
yet in a manner so delicate and reserved as to run no risk&#xD;
of offending her sensibilities. He wished the language itself&#xD;

to breathe the fervor of his own heart. He would fain en-&#xD;
kindle in the *breast of Angeline the sweet affection that&#xD;
eddied in his own warm nature. But, alas ! how impotent&#xD;
did he feel for this end. He would willingly have pledged a&#xD;
lifetime of study and practice, could he have possessed for but&#xD;
a moment the eloquence which this culture would secure him.&#xD;
He labored long at his delightful effort. He brooded over&#xD;
it by day, and it mingled by night with his dreams. He&#xD;
attempted over and over again to embody with clearness the&#xD;
vague conceptions of his brain. But nothing suited him.&#xD;
This expressed too little, that too much; here he had di-&#xD;
vulged his sentiments too nakedly ; there his thoughts were&#xD;
too concealed. These, too animated, those, too tame. Thus&#xD;
days and nights melted into the oblivion of the past.&#xD;
At length he awake one morning sweetly refreshed. The&#xD;
evasive lucubration of his brain had taken to itself a graceful&#xD;
shape. It now lay in his mind a little poem of his heart,&#xD;
each word of which was a tendril chord of love. Seizing his&#xD;
pen, the bright sentences reeled off like golden threads, and&#xD;
the letter was completed to his joyful enthusiasm.&#xD;
He next began fondly to speculate upon the complexion of&#xD;
Angeline's missive to him. Hope pictured to his heart the&#xD;
bright dreams of anticipation, and time dallied with his&#xD;
feelings with sweetly painful suspense.&#xD;
Examination day came. The room had been scrubbed&#xD;
and decorated, and looked now, neatly fresh and verdant.&#xD;
Teachers, pupils, parents and friends all assembled, over-&#xD;
flowing the rustic temple of learning with ardent, enthusiastic&#xD;
nature. Garbed with tidiest care, and each face wearing its&#xD;
sweetest look, the whole scene had the bloom of the morning&#xD;
rose. Each bosom kindled with varied emotion, but a com-&#xD;
mon sympathy swayed a sentiment of grateful accord.&#xD;
All passed off with mutual satisfaction. Each congratu-&#xD;
&#xD;
lated the other, and received a heightened recompense in the&#xD;
generosity of his own feelings. As the weight of anxiety&#xD;
was lifted from one and another breast, the heart leaped up&#xD;
with bounding joy, and the countenances of all became&#xD;
wreathed in sunny smiles. The remarks of the committee&#xD;
and the closing address of the teacher were eloquent and&#xD;
affecting, because falling upon sympathetic ground. A happy&#xD;
school-closing is oneof the bright days of a pupil's life.&#xD;
Next came the exchange of billets. Walter hurried away&#xD;
with Angeline's, under a feverish impatience. How neat and&#xD;
beautiful its form! How sweet and dainty the superscrip-&#xD;
tion ! His heart panted for the delicious draught awaiting&#xD;
for him within. He opened it. It was nice, pretty, written&#xD;
with care ; but he looked in vain for the fervor that glowed&#xD;
in his own bosom. A seeming coldness pervaded.the lines,&#xD;
that sent a chill to his feelings. le felt disappointed. How&#xD;
easy to foster into life some sweet dream of our own wishes,&#xD;
until a touch of the Ithureal spear of reality dispels the&#xD;
illusion and brings dreariness to our hopes.&#xD;
But ' on re-perusing day by day the gentle billet-doux, a&#xD;
new spirit seemed to exude from its delicate lines, and, ere&#xD;
long, it became linked to his heart in golden association&#xD;
with the happy vision of his life.&#xD;

STORY OF THE YONKER.         279&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
"'T is a history,&#xD;
Handed prom ages down; a nurse's tale --&#xD;
Which children, open-eye'd and mouth'd, devour;&#xD;
And thus as garrulous ignorance relates,&#xD;
We learn it and believe." - SouruY's THALABA.&#xD;
THAT's a strange story about the Yonker, " Unc. Oaker,"&#xD;
mused Walter.&#xD;
"I agree that it is," replied the venerable fisherman, "but&#xD;
I believe from my soul 'tis true, every word of it, for I fancy&#xD;
having once seen the strange sight myself, and if I didn't, I&#xD;
know enough persons that have."&#xD;
"Be so good as to narrate the particulars," resumed Wal-&#xD;
ter, with an accent of lively curiosity ; "I have often heard&#xD;
the story mentioned, but have never been able to learn a full&#xD;
account of it."&#xD;
"That would take too long time just now," replied the&#xD;
fisherman, "but the upshot of the affair in a few words, as I&#xD;
have heard it, is this :-.&#xD;
" There once lived on the Beach, near the bend of the&#xD;
Cove, a strange, mysterious man and a young woman, whom&#xD;
people took for his daughter. They lived together all alone&#xD;
in the sorriest looking hut that can be imagined. It was&#xD;
framed with drift-stuff, filled in with meadow-turf, beach-&#xD;
grass, and sea-weed. They used the joints of a whale's back-&#xD;
bone for stools, and shark's jaws bristling with teeth were&#xD;
stuck here and there on the sides of the hut.&#xD;
(278)&#xD;
&#xD;
" The old man was small of stature, with a sunburnt, briny&#xD;
face. He wore a thick, full beard, flowing almost to his&#xD;
knees, which was sprinkled with gray. - His feet were covered&#xD;
with some tough dried skin, which was laced up his leg,&#xD;
serving as a boot. A fur skin fell from his shoulders, which&#xD;
was girded around his waist.  This was turned according to&#xD;
the weather, sometimes presenting the fur, at others the skin,&#xD;
outward. Upon his head was a curiously formed cap of&#xD;
birds' skins. A fowling piece, fishing-rod, draille, and net&#xD;
were the only articles he was seen to have.&#xD;
"The young woman was garbed in a similar manner as&#xD;
the man, except that in cold weather she wore a close hood,&#xD;
enveloping completely her head, neck and face, with apertures&#xD;
for her eyes, and in summer an enormous brimmed hat, with&#xD;
gauze veil stretched around the brim.&#xD;
"She always accompanied the old man whenever he went&#xD;
out, whatever might be the inclemency of the weather, but&#xD;
she was never seen to assist him, or exert herself in aid, in&#xD;
any manner whatever.&#xD;
"All who had ever caught a glimpse. of the young woman&#xD;
bore the same testimony, that she possessed a gentle, feminine&#xD;
countenance of great sweetness. There was a delicacy - in&#xD;
her limbs, and a grace in her movements that was quite mar-&#xD;
vellous. But she seemed bound to the old wretch, whose&#xD;
footsteps she everywhere followed with undeviating constancy.&#xD;
"cThey avoided society, and shunned the gaze of curiosity.&#xD;
No one could be found who had ever spoken to them, and an&#xD;
impenetrable mystery hung about their pathway.&#xD;
"One day, after a dreadful shipwreck that happened&#xD;
near he-re, when the few survivors had crowded upon the&#xD;
beach, this young woman was seen to issue from the hut, and&#xD;
stealthily hold a conversation with one of the sailors. Since&#xD;
that time neither the old man nor the young woman, his com-&#xD;
panion, have been seen or heard from.&#xD;

THE FISHER BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
"On searching their hut nothing was found save a few&#xD;
cooking utensils, and a knife, rusty and clotted with blood.&#xD;
" Various have been the stories as to the existence and fate&#xD;
of these strangers. The more common belief is that the old&#xD;
man was some son of Neptune who, having captured a fair&#xD;
passenger from a ship in the Indian seas, bore her to this&#xD;
distant shore, and bound her in a perpetual vow of celibacy&#xD;
to his destiny. But having broken her vow by talking with&#xD;
the young sailor, she expiated her fault by death, inflicted by&#xD;
this son of Neptune.&#xD;
"From that time shrieks and groans, as from a person in&#xD;
death agony, were not unfrequently heard near the spot where&#xD;
stood the hut ; and of a dark, lowering .night, persons were&#xD;
wont' often to see a strange, unearthly light, that while it&#xD;
filled them with horrid fear, exercised over them a mysterious&#xD;
fascination to lure them far 'away down the beach."&#xD;
This conversation passed between Walter and one of the&#xD;
crew, while on their way, to haul off the fishing pink for&#xD;
another summer's cruise. The boy had compromised with&#xD;
his mother for one more season at sea. The experience of&#xD;
-the past year had only awakened a stronger propensity for an&#xD;
ocean life, and he would fain have consummated his darling in-&#xD;
tention of rushing on board a square-rigger in the merchant&#xD;
service but for the anguish he saw such a step would bring to&#xD;
the heart of his poor mother.&#xD;
Their thick-set boat moiled her way lazily through the-&#xD;
crisping waves, fanned by a gasping air ; and it was quite&#xD;
dark before they struck the shore of the beach at all.' And&#xD;
when they did, finding themselves only at the Inward Point,&#xD;
some five miles from the outward one, they very naturally&#xD;
decided to haul up where they were, and tarry for the night.&#xD;
So turning over their boat under the lea of a hillock, and&#xD;
banking her-cozily up with sea-weed, they were, in snug con-&#xD;
dition for a night's slumber.&#xD;
&#xD;
280&#xD;
&#xD;
T  t&#xD;
&#xD;
But Walter could not tie down his wakeful spirit so readily.&#xD;
The buoyancy of limb that comes, upon first springing ashore,&#xD;
after wearisome -confinement in a boat, took possession of&#xD;
him. The associations of the previous spring, too, imparted&#xD;
liveliness to his feelings. Under the double- influence, he&#xD;
bounded off with some others for the genial luxury of a&#xD;
stroll. It was, of course, a mere aimless ramble, and for that&#xD;
all the more delightful.&#xD;
Falling into an abstracted mood, he soon found himself&#xD;
apart from the others. Striking the East shore, he padded&#xD;
over the smooth, shelving beach, his eye drinking in. the&#xD;
inspiration of the dusky scenery, his nind hovering upon the&#xD;
dream-land of Fancy.&#xD;
The flap of a sea-gull disturbed his reverie, when he became&#xD;
aware how far he had wandered from the boat. Night 'had&#xD;
completely assumed her reign, having let down her dark cur-&#xD;
tain in the West.&#xD;
With a slight apprehension that he might lose his way he&#xD;
set off with nervous step to return. Before making half his&#xD;
distance, he felt conscious of becoming fairly bewildered.&#xD;
There was not the vestige of a guide to direct his uncertain&#xD;
foot-steps. The way, too, was precarious. Hillock and hol-&#xD;
low, marsh and creek, staggered his faltering feet.&#xD;
The brisk exercise had warmed his blood, which, in turn&#xD;
imparted a tinge of fervor to his mind. The embarrassment&#xD;
of his situation filled with disquietude his feelings. Imagina-&#xD;
tion was busy amid the supernatural, and Memory turned to&#xD;
the story of the Yonker.&#xD;
Amid this hallucination, his perception was seized with a&#xD;
blue spectral light in the distance. The vision quickly ap-&#xD;
proached him, enlarging and assuming a deep, fiery aspect&#xD;
until within a few yards, when, exploding with a loud noise,&#xD;
the scintillation shot, off from the centre, and arraigned in a&#xD;
24*&#xD;
&#xD;
281&#xD;
&#xD;
A SPECTRAL LIGHT.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC8107-00000143"/>&#xD;
THE FISHER BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
circle of deep brilliancy. Within the starry belt, the outline of&#xD;
a human face gradually appeared to his wild gaze. The sight&#xD;
seized him with profound terror. The figure struck him as&#xD;
the same features that had so often haunted his footsteps, only&#xD;
now the hair stood out dishevelled, as if streaming in the&#xD;
breeze, and upon the haggard, suffering countenance, were here&#xD;
and, there large clots of blood. Continuing to approach, the&#xD;
dismal apparition now stood within fearful nearness of his own&#xD;
person, when a piercing shriek, as of excruciating anguish,&#xD;
rent the air and fell with lightning thrill upon the ear of&#xD;
Walter. Under the shock, he swooned to the earth in a par-&#xD;
oxyism of terror, and in a moment all consciousness had faded&#xD;
from his mental vision.&#xD;
On returning to consciousness, he was aware of but little&#xD;
more than the cold touch of the ground, the stark chill of the&#xD;
evening air, while a ghastly vision haunted his memory. He&#xD;
arose to his feet, and with stiffened limbs set out anew. For&#xD;
some time he wandered over the grizzly beach in hopeless be-&#xD;
wilderment. And he was on the point of yielding to despair,&#xD;
when his eye fixed itself with beaming hope upon a faint light&#xD;
in the distance. He had before thought it only some inferior&#xD;
star in the distant vault; but now, suddenly, as if by revela-&#xD;
tion, he felt it must be a stationary light, upon the beach. He&#xD;
followed it, and was led directly to the boat, where the light&#xD;
had been .set by the thoughtful crew, as a beacon to guide&#xD;
back the strolling hands.&#xD;
They listened with speechless awe to the curdling narration&#xD;
of Walter. All the wild accounts afloat of the Yonker were&#xD;
but too true. It were sacrelegious to speak lightly of the mys-&#xD;
terious affair ever again. Seamen are affected by the marvel-&#xD;
lous and the strange. Stories of the supernatural thrill a con-&#xD;
genial chord of their nature.&#xD;
The next morning, the wind being contrary for sailing, it&#xD;
&#xD;
was thought most expeditious to tow their boat along shore to&#xD;
the Powder Hole, where the vessel on which they were to&#xD;
embark for the summer's- fishing cruise, had lain through the&#xD;
winter, hauled up on the flats.&#xD;
But they found it a wearying toil, it being half tide, and the&#xD;
current setting perseveringly against them; and the bold&#xD;
energy and stout muscles of the crew were put fairly to the&#xD;
test, by the time they had reached the Point. Here they&#xD;
found their old low decked schooner, moored by her weight&#xD;
upon the uncomplaining flat, as an overtasked mortal resting&#xD;
from his labors. She was mouldy as a long neglected cheese;&#xD;
but after much scrubbing and drying, the quaint cabin was&#xD;
rendered tenable, and exhausted by the stretch of the day's&#xD;
tug, they were all very willing to embrace early the night's&#xD;
slumber.&#xD;
As indifferent as they had become to objects around them,&#xD;
by the mere sinking of physical energy, they could not but be&#xD;
struck by the exceeding serenity and beauty of the closing&#xD;
day. Not a breath of air ruffled the glassy bosom of the&#xD;
ocean. Not a speck of cloud could be seen in the heavenly&#xD;
vault. The atmosphere exhibited a transparency rarely&#xD;
noticed. In the midst of the universal calm, the sun fell&#xD;
behind the western horizon, like a golden ball dropped into a&#xD;
sea of molten lead. It was as if Nature had paused to contem-&#xD;
plate the sublimity of creation.&#xD;
But this lovely grace of Nature proved but the hectic blush&#xD;
that bodes dissolution. In less than three hours after sunset,&#xD;
there burst forth one of the most furious and awful -gales&#xD;
within the remembrance of the oldest of the crew. It seemed&#xD;
as if Nature, repenting her own existence, had turned in awful&#xD;
phrenzied power upon self-destruction. Life and nature are&#xD;
full of contrasts, but none had been experienced greater than&#xD;
this.&#xD;

A TERRIFIC GALE.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC8107-00000144"/>&#xD;
A VESSEL WRECKED.              285&#xD;
&#xD;
The irrepressible force of the gale drove in the dead lights&#xD;
of their vessel, and no efforts on the part of the most skilful&#xD;
could secure them back in their place. The lights were in&#xD;
consequence extinguished, and the cabin drenched with driv-&#xD;
ing spray and sleet. It was a dreadful night, even to the&#xD;
housed fishermen; what must it have been then to the unpro-&#xD;
tected seaman upon the angry waves. Walter thought he had&#xD;
never before experienced so much suffering. He was pre-&#xD;
pared to expect hard exposure at sea, but so much of it,&#xD;
snugly ensconsed in a vessel's cabin upon the land, was un-&#xD;
looked for by him. In this cold and gloomy predicament,&#xD;
they shiVered through the night.&#xD;
Early in the morning, covering their shivering bodies with&#xD;
clothing as best they could, the crew, one and all, crawled&#xD;
upon deck, with a shuddering curiosity. The scene was ter-&#xD;
rific. The energy of the raging elements nearly took the&#xD;
breath out of Walter. The ocean all around was lashed wildly&#xD;
into foam and spray. Nought could be seen above but the&#xD;
imperious storm-cloud that seemed to hug the earth and sea&#xD;
with phrenzy. The rain, wreathed by the intenseness of the&#xD;
wind into coarse mist, now drove in blinding thickness, now in&#xD;
cutting blasts. The tide, goaded by the maddened sea, had&#xD;
swollen above the low beach where they were, and the whole&#xD;
point of land forming the harbor had become submerged&#xD;
beneath the clashing waters.  One would have said that&#xD;
remorseless ocean had made a successful war upon earth, and&#xD;
that hereafter man was to be tossed forever upon the treacher-&#xD;
ous wave.&#xD;
As soon as a lull enabled the crew to peer through the&#xD;
storm, something broke upon their straining vision.&#xD;
"what was it?"&#xD;
" A wreck."&#xD;
" Where ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
"Ashore upon the Shovel-Full."&#xD;
" Gracious heavens!"&#xD;
" Can we get to her?"&#xD;
"No; impossible at present."&#xD;
Their manly sympathies were aroused to the utmost. The&#xD;
ill-fated vessel, with keel apparently welded to the sandy bot-&#xD;
tom, reeled like a drunken man. The fretted waves dashed&#xD;
over her with engulfing impetuosity.- Her dishevelled ropes&#xD;
streamed in the wind, and she looked forlorn and touching.&#xD;
What more pitiful than the spectacle of a wrecked vessel at&#xD;
the mercy of the maddened elements !&#xD;
But their deep solicitude for the vessel paled by the side of&#xD;
the awful apprehension felt for the fate of her company. Had&#xD;
they been suddenly precipitated to a watery grave ? or Were&#xD;
they still hanging upon the wreck in dreadful suspense ?&#xD;
With the genuine, noble sympathies of honest, simple na-&#xD;
tures, they watched the vessel with.sleepless vigilance. At&#xD;
length people were descried on board. What a thrill of ex-&#xD;
citement the vision sent through their bosoms ! How every&#xD;
impulse of their big hearts leapt forth and nerved itself to&#xD;
attempt a rescue !&#xD;
The wind by this time had veered from the east into the&#xD;
south-west. It had moderated its fury, and the drenching&#xD;
clouds had rolled back in the sky in distant threatening. The&#xD;
water too, obeying the general subsidence, had ebbed from the&#xD;
beach.&#xD;
It was still thought too hazardous to attempt boarding the&#xD;
distressed vessel; but they found no difficulty in pulling ashore&#xD;
to the inward bend ; and gathering in a knot upon the grassy&#xD;
beach, awaited with intense anxiety an opportunity for extend-&#xD;
ing relief.&#xD;
Presently the people on board were noticed to move about.&#xD;

&#xD;
THE FISHER BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
They seemed earnestly engaged upon something. What&#xD;
could it be ? Soon their long-boat danced upon the water,&#xD;
under the lea of the vessel. What were they going to attempt ?&#xD;
To land? Preposterous ! They would certainly be engulfed.&#xD;
The crew ashore, in the earnestness of their sympathetic&#xD;
nature, made the most energetic signs in their power to dis-&#xD;
suade those on board from so dangerous an exploit as the trial&#xD;
to land.&#xD;
Under ordinary circumstances, the waves, under the hercu-&#xD;
lean force of the gale, exposed to the whole range of the&#xD;
Atlantic, would have run with a mountain height, to menace&#xD;
the sure engnlfing of so small a craft as a ship's long-boat,&#xD;
but here, checked in their impetuous career by a strong counter&#xD;
current that forever ran with the speed of a race-horse around&#xD;
the Point, had thrown them into a wild, tumultuous fury, that&#xD;
made it seem impossible for a boat to live a moment amid the&#xD;
breakers.&#xD;
Then the peril of the landing was imminent. The shore,&#xD;
from the tide mark, was shelving, running quickly off to great&#xD;
depth into the ocean. The mountain waves would roll in,&#xD;
with careering sublimity, strike upon the shore, and run foam-&#xD;
ing to a great distance up the hard sanded floor of the landing,&#xD;
and then retreat as hastily. The under current thus formed,&#xD;
was so overpowering as to render extremely uncertain the&#xD;
most energetic efforts to extricate one's self from the surf, and&#xD;
make way up the beach.&#xD;
But no such difficulties seemed to daunt the wrecked sea-&#xD;
men. In due time their boat was seen to part from their ves-&#xD;
sel. Fearful moment! Their fate hung upon how slender a&#xD;
thread! How much were not a few short moments to reveal!&#xD;
As to the crew ashore, they .could - scarcely believe their&#xD;
eyes. As they gazed in amazement, their hearts froze in&#xD;
&#xD;
y&#xD;
&#xD;
..&#xD;
&#xD;
THRILLING SCENE.                 287&#xD;
alarm. More from instinct than reason, they sprang and&#xD;
fetched from their boat ropes, oars, and everything they had,&#xD;
which they thought could possibly aid in the rescue.&#xD;
The landing boat experienced the most thrilling vicissitudes.&#xD;
She looked so potentless amid the angry, surging billows. At&#xD;
one moment she would disappear entirely from view.&#xD;
"There, she 's gone !" would exclaim with bitter anguish,&#xD;
some one of the anxious fishermen.&#xD;
" No, there she is !" would shout another, as she was again&#xD;
tossed to view.&#xD;
As she neared the shore, escaping every danger, as if kept&#xD;
by some guardian divinity, Walter's searching eye fell upon a&#xD;
female form, enveloped in the folds of a cloak, and reclining&#xD;
upon the stern sheets. At the unexpected sight, his sympa-&#xD;
thies were excited to their utmost. Curiosity, tender sym-&#xD;
pathy, thrilling heroism all possessed him, and raised his soul&#xD;
to conscious power.&#xD;
As the boat touched the shore, another billow struck her&#xD;
fated sides, and capsized the frail bark in the surf. A wild&#xD;
shriek rent the air. Walter, rushing forth in consternation,&#xD;
sprung into the foaming surf.&#xD;
The boy knew no more, until finding himself upon the&#xD;
beach by the side of the rescued female, with both boats' crews&#xD;
endeavoring to recall the swooned female to life.&#xD;
She at length opened languidly her eyes, and murmuring&#xD;
faintly the words, "My father," sunk back from the undue&#xD;
effort. She was quickly conveyed to the light-house, not far&#xD;
distant, where all means that Christian hearts could suggest,&#xD;
were used for her immediate restoration.&#xD;
The fishing crew withgrateful hearts returned to their ves-&#xD;
sel, and after refreshing themselves with food and slumber,&#xD;
entertained each other in recounting the thrilling marvels of&#xD;
the boat's landing.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC8107-00000146"/>&#xD;
288&#xD;
&#xD;
It appeared that the wrecked seamen, hurled into the mad-&#xD;
dening surf, struggled long, but ineffectually, against the&#xD;
powerful under current. Perceiving their case to be hopeless,&#xD;
the fishing crew, with the clear eye of experience, seized upon&#xD;
the only means of their rescue. Binding ropes to two of the&#xD;
most athletic of their number, these rushed into the surf, seized&#xD;
each a drowning man, when the two were hauled ashore by&#xD;
the nervous arms upon the beach. Walter, the first rescued,&#xD;
was found clasped in a drowning embrace, by the young&#xD;
woman whom he had with so generous an impulse perilled his&#xD;
own life to save, and the two, perfectly unconscious, were fast&#xD;
drifting seaward.&#xD;
Early the next morning, a messenger appeared by the side&#xD;
of the vessel, bringing invitation that the father of the rescued&#xD;
lady craved the happiness of seeing the fishing crew at the&#xD;
light-house, to express acknowledgments for the priceless favor&#xD;
he had, received from the strangers. He was a Polish exile&#xD;
of noble birth, seeking a home in the new world, where he&#xD;
had friends that had preceded him. Curiosity in the bosoms&#xD;
of the crew mingled with a natural emotion of complacency,&#xD;
p'onpted them to see the noble strangers again, and receive&#xD;
their heartfelt thanks. Accordingly, each decked himself in&#xD;
his best, and all set out for the light-house. Here they were met&#xD;
by the grateful father, who, overcome with emotions of gratitude&#xD;
towards his deliverers, lavished upon them every testimony&#xD;
his soul could command, of his grateful love. He seized the&#xD;
hand of each in tenderness, and pressed it to his bosom. He&#xD;
hung fervently upon their necks, and kissed their bronzed&#xD;
cheeks in manly emotion. He laid at their feet all his little&#xD;
wealth, saved from his vast fortune, -his money and jewels.&#xD;
These the noble fishermen absolutely declined accepting.&#xD;
As they were about leaving, it was announced that the&#xD;
rescued lady could not be persuaded to neglect the opportu-&#xD;
PP&#xD;

&#xD;
nity of adding her grateful thanks to those of the father. She&#xD;
was still very weak, and her physician deemed any undue&#xD;
excitement as dangerous to her recovery, but the feelings of&#xD;
nature in her breast overbore those of prudence.&#xD;
As each one of the crew, in turn, was conducted to the side&#xD;
of the suffering lady, who lay bolstered upon a couch, she&#xD;
seized with emotion his hand, pressed it first to her lips and&#xD;
then to her heart, in mute but fervent gratitude. She pos-&#xD;
sessed no tongue with which to express the feelings of her&#xD;
soul, but there was about her slightest movement a sweet, lofty&#xD;
grace, and there beamed in her countenance a smile so inef-&#xD;
fably thankful, that the hardy crew would have felt repaid a&#xD;
thousand fold for any dangers they had encountered, in effect-&#xD;
ing her rescue, even if the deed itself had not brought with it&#xD;
its own sweet reward.&#xD;
As Walter approached her bed-side, she gazed for a mo-&#xD;
ment intently into his face ; then -seeming to recognize his&#xD;
features, her countenance suddenly lit up with a tint of im-&#xD;
mortal bloom ; her eyes moistened in deep tenderness ; and&#xD;
her whole frame shook with emotion. Grasping his hand in&#xD;
both hers, with eyes imploringly uplifted, she was about press-&#xD;
ing it earnestly- to her breast, when overtasked nature gave&#xD;
way, and she fell back apparently lifeless.&#xD;
All other attentions were now lost in solicitude for the faint-&#xD;
ing girl; and Walter, with the crew, fearing their presence&#xD;
might but add to the general embarrassment, quietly with-&#xD;
drew.&#xD;
The next morning they were informed that the young&#xD;
Polish lady, though feeble, had been restored to consciousness.&#xD;
Although she had received a deep shock from the scenes of&#xD;
the previous day, yet she was not deemed dangerously ill;&#xD;
and if no new circumstance conspired to derange her nervous&#xD;
system, she might look to a restoration in a few days.&#xD;

THE FISHER BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
The intelligence came with especial delight to Walter.&#xD;
Aside from the feelings of humanity, he owned in his heart to&#xD;
a peculiar interest felt for the fair stranger. It might be&#xD;
traced to the self-forgetful heroism of his own conduct; it&#xD;
might proceed from the charm of her noble grace ; the mys-&#xD;
tery of her life, or the peculiar relations in which he found&#xD;
himself with her, and the passionate tenderness of her grati-&#xD;
tude. Whatever it might proceed from, yet as he contemplated&#xD;
her beauteous form in the silence of his thought, he felt a&#xD;
strange emotion arise within him. But when the image of&#xD;
Angeline sprang in his breast, that of the fair stranger faded&#xD;
into oblivion. It was the paling of the moon before the glow-&#xD;
ing god of day.,&#xD;
&#xD;

IT was a beautiful morning in June, that a fine looking&#xD;
schooner might have been seen just rounding to, in the time-&#xD;
honored anchorage of the Deep Hole.   Presently a small&#xD;
boat, manned with five hands, darted from the vessel, and&#xD;
pulled briskly for the shore. One of the buoyant spirits&#xD;
aboard this gay little carrier was Walter Carl.&#xD;
Two fruitful years have elapsed since we parted the boy's&#xD;
company upon the old gray beach. In this bright interval,&#xD;
we shall find that time has sat but lightly upon his fair brow.&#xD;
Fortune has not withheld him her smiling face; and with&#xD;
benignant Nature, he has found boon companionship.&#xD;
Having gradually overcome the scruples of his mother&#xD;
against a sea-life, he had at length escaped "the uncongenial&#xD;
employment of Fishing, and he now found himself greatly&#xD;
more happy, in the larger variety of life to be metwith in the&#xD;
Coasting Trade. This rambling manner of sailing, enabled&#xD;
him to venture farther and farther from home, until his last&#xD;
absence had been a very delightful trip to one of the West&#xD;

it cast a delicious dreamy charm over all his faculties, but&#xD;
deepened the sentiment of love that glowed in his heart.&#xD;
But in all respects, Walter was not the same'boy as in the&#xD;
tender years of childhood. Busy Time had left happy traces&#xD;
of his sculpturing fingers upon his person ; and the actual of&#xD;
life had expanded his intelligence and schooled his spirit.&#xD;
His glossy, raven locks had assumed a rich brown color. His&#xD;
sweet, piercing eye had become more tender, calm and&#xD;
spiritual. His delicate, fragile form had developed to a&#xD;
stoutness, that seemed to indicate strength in repose. His&#xD;
soft, fair complexion had ripened into a rich color, resembling&#xD;
that of the maturing fruit. Indeed, his person, bearing, and&#xD;
expression betokened a gain in Character, courage and manli.-&#xD;
ness, traits not always overlooked even by the finer delicacy&#xD;
of the female eye.&#xD;
Walter bounded over the beach toward his dear home, with&#xD;
gladsome feet. Oh, how joyful was the anticipation of the&#xD;
meeting with his endeared mother  He knew that her love&#xD;
for him was deep, sincere, purged from all earthly dross --&#xD;
that it came from the bottom of her heart. Time and distance&#xD;
and silent nature, when alone in the dark night-watch, and in&#xD;
the more lonely haunts of strange men, had awakened the&#xD;
filial sentiment in his own breast to a passion.&#xD;
'to feel beloved is sweet, but to feel assured that this love&#xD;
springs from a truthful, strong, disinterested soul, a soul capa-&#xD;
ble of appreciating worth, of comprehending the nature of its&#xD;
own passion, of making the sacrifices which true love requires,&#xD;
this brings a tranquil security of joy, that is happiness in its&#xD;
most blessed state.&#xD;
Walter was taking along with him a little money, the earn-&#xD;
ings of his voyage,- a few gift-articles, the products of the&#xD;
torrid zone, gathered on his way ; such as fruit, preserves,&#xD;
wine, birds, and beautiful shells; trifles they might be in them-&#xD;

selves, but were they not earned by his own honest arm? the&#xD;
relics of his own travels ? and they would be presented as the&#xD;
gifts of affection. They could not but bring a gleam of sun-&#xD;
shine to the brow of his mother, and cast a gilding ray upon&#xD;
her declining years. She who had striven so hard, had suf-&#xD;
fered so deeply, had waited so long and patiently, had done&#xD;
all, getting nothing in return, was now to be assured that the&#xD;
day of recompense though often long deferred, yet surely&#xD;
cometh. Walter felt a peculiar joy in being able to bestow&#xD;
even so little. He had so long been the recipient, having&#xD;
nothing but gratitude and thanks to return for favors, that&#xD;
this power of giving something substantial. brought to his&#xD;
breast a feeling of peculiar pride and pleasure. He only&#xD;
wished it were greater, that he had possessed the wealth of&#xD;
the Indies, to lay at her honored feet.&#xD;
Very soon Walter was locked in the affectionate embrace&#xD;
of his mother. How richly blessed was the moment to the&#xD;
loving woman ! Hope and anticipation were blended in joyful&#xD;
fruition. How her heart thrilled with gratitude, as she thought&#xD;
* how many others had found a watery grave, or had been cut&#xD;
off by pestilential disease, while her noble boy had been re-&#xD;
turned to her. Then he came to her in blooming health, a&#xD;
picture of life and beauty. More than all, he had come to&#xD;
her bosom, his heart untravelled, his purity unsullied. She&#xD;
felt this in his fragrant breath, she read it in his clear, tranquil&#xD;
eye. She knew it by the instincts of maternal love.&#xD;
Having decked himself tidily in garments which the fond&#xD;
hand of affection had so nicely prepared and held in store for&#xD;
him, he sauntered out amid some of the localities about his&#xD;
home which were so endeared to his youthful association. He&#xD;
then ventured farther, strolling off to the haunts which he re-&#xD;
membered Angeline was in the habit of frequenting. Indeed,&#xD;
he more than half wished to meet the fair girl, or at least&#xD;

catch a glimpse of her dear form. But so early pleasure was&#xD;
not to be his.&#xD;
The next day was the Sabbath. It was a lovely morning,&#xD;
serene, sunny, soft, fresh as the dew, and fragrant as the&#xD;
breath of new mown hay. The birds carrolled gladsomely&#xD;
amid'the trembling foliage, and the roses blushed with modest&#xD;
joy, under the windows. Indeed, it was, one of those days,&#xD;
that seem nectar-drops from, the full bumper of heaven.&#xD;
He set off with the rest of the family for the Parish Church,&#xD;
with lustrous feelings, with the feelings of ardent youth just&#xD;
returned from long absence, expecting from others the same&#xD;
joyful welcome that was glowing in his own breast.&#xD;
As he entered the portal of the Church, his bosom swelled&#xD;
with delightful emotions. He was everywhere greeted with&#xD;
expressions of warm, gracious welcome ; yet his eye did not&#xD;
fall upon Angeline. But he felt sure of seeing her as beau-&#xD;
tiful as ever in the choir, from which she rarely absented&#xD;
herself. Yet after the first prayer, rising with the congrega-&#xD;
tion, and turning with expected hope toward the singers, how&#xD;
blank was his disappointment to perceive her place vacant.*&#xD;
A feeling of painful solicitude seized him. Why was she&#xD;
absent ? indispositi9n, absence from home, indifference to his&#xD;
return, which she must have known. Was it any of these, or&#xD;
what was it that had kept her away ? Cruel conjecture&#xD;
haunted his breast for the rest of the day. He breathed his&#xD;
own jaundiced sentiments, rather than the hallowed incense of&#xD;
the house of God. So easy is it to pervert the heaven within&#xD;
us, and change the milk of love into the gall of human bit-&#xD;
terness.&#xD;
His steps homeward were languid. The night was dream-&#xD;
less of joy.  The next day and the days following were&#xD;
passed upon the rack of suspense. Suspicion, with heavy&#xD;
armor, clanged at his footsteps. He could learn nothing of,&#xD;
&#xD;
Angeline.- He dared not even ask. He greatly feared to&#xD;
betray the intensity of his feelings. Like the murderer, he&#xD;
bore about him concealed the momentous secret of his heart,&#xD;
until every shadow seemed endowed with a searching eye to&#xD;
penetrate his secret, and a trumpet tongue to proclaim it to&#xD;
tie world.&#xD;
At length, in one of those bold moments that accompany&#xD;
an excited mind, he resolved upon knowing his fate ; seizing a&#xD;
pen, he addressed Angeline, soliciting the pleasure of an in-&#xD;
terview at her father's on an appointed evening. Too impa-&#xD;
tient to wait the tedious course of the mail, and not caring&#xD;
to entrust the important missive in the hands of another, he&#xD;
filled the little trust of messenger himself.&#xD;
The maid who came to the door, at Mr. Redeliff's, received&#xD;
Walter's billet with a bland smile, and the boy flew home-&#xD;
ward with a beating pulse.&#xD;
Yet he felt much disquietude of mind as to the propriety of&#xD;
the step he had taken. Would she not deem it presumptuous&#xD;
in him to address her so boldly, and might it notwound her'&#xD;
'delicacy to be thus drawn into a disclosure of her real senti-&#xD;
ments toward him ? Then how brief was the interval between&#xD;
him and his fate. He could wish even to prolong his trouble-&#xD;
some suspense, if ill fortune was to be his. He trembled as&#xD;
upon the verge of a chasm that might yawn and engulf him.&#xD;
Time, with unwearied wing, at length ushered in the eve of&#xD;
his appointment. Attiring himself with fastidious care, he set&#xD;
out with nervous step for the house of Angeline. The even-&#xD;
ing was calm. A gentle quiet reigned around, a placid sweet-&#xD;
ness distilled upon his spirit, but he was stirred too deeply&#xD;
within to be soothed by the velvet hand of nature.&#xD;
The cottage of Angeline presently ,broke to view. It was&#xD;
nestled modestly behind a small garden of shrubbery and&#xD;
flowers, which were rippling in the moonlight sheen, as if to&#xD;
&#xD;
DISQUIETUDE.             295&#xD;

&#xD;
AN EVENING VISIT.            297&#xD;
&#xD;
waft him with gracious welcome. How exciting the visionI&#xD;
He stood a moment in the garden path. A light glimmered&#xD;
softly through the shutters of the green blinds, and the door&#xD;
stood slightly ajar. Was it not a token of expectance and&#xD;
welcome ?  How blissful the thought ! There are moments&#xD;
in which are distilled the joy of years.&#xD;
At his gentle tap, the fair girl came instantly to the door.&#xD;
The very promptness of her movement was a volume of&#xD;
sweet revelation to his heart. How perfectly beautiful did&#xD;
she appear to the boy's enraptured eyes. How neatly attired,&#xD;
how exquisite her toilet; how tasteful her decoration, and,&#xD;
more than all, what a sweet smile of grace lit up her features&#xD;
as she blandly welcomed him in. Wealth and Fashion may&#xD;
gild their votaries with the fabrics of earth, and the gems of&#xD;
the sea, but there lies in the simple taste of nature, a wondrous&#xD;
skill that can surpass the most cunning devise of art.&#xD;
The evening passed most happily with Walter. A serene&#xD;
joy filled his heart, such as he had never before experienced.&#xD;
Could it be, that he was in possession of what in the distance&#xD;
had beamed with such fascinating power upon his longing&#xD;
heart?  The reality appeared to him a blissful dream!&#xD;
The fond couple were sweetly alone, yet there grew up be-&#xD;
tween them no personal familiarity, that course wile of a&#xD;
prurient taste, no base flattery, that false coinage of the heart.&#xD;
Not even social freedom was established. Deep emotions&#xD;
find not a ready utterance. Exquisite sensibility is shrink-&#xD;
ingly timid. Theirs was rather a silent communing, the sym-&#xD;
pathy of the eye, the magnetism of look.&#xD;
Then Walter felt the embarrassment of a new situation.&#xD;
His soul had not yet moulted its maidenly reserve.  His&#xD;
tongue was fettered by lack of culture, and the sailor possesses&#xD;
not the small change of talk by which society manages to fill&#xD;
up the gaps of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
But time flew with rapid wing, and when he arose to de-&#xD;
part, he was surprised to perceive, that the antique clock in&#xD;
the corner indicated the hour of eleven.&#xD;
His steps homeward were as light as those of a fawn. The&#xD;
ground;felt delightful to his touch. Passing objects bore the&#xD;
greeting smile of friends. The air came laden with balmy&#xD;
fragrance, and the- very darkness seemed gloved with velvet&#xD;
smoothness.&#xD;
There is one moment in life, when the heart having attained&#xD;
the goal of its wishes, pauses an instant in the fulness of its&#xD;
happiness, wishing nothing more in life.&#xD;
Such was .the present state of Walter. Every form of&#xD;
disquiet had disappeared, behind the glow of his present&#xD;
emotions, and any lot in life he would welcome, if accompa-&#xD;
nied by the joy that reigned now in his breast.&#xD;
Walter had gained permission of Angeline to continue his&#xD;
visits. This he did for some time, without its becoming known&#xD;
in the neighborhood.  Circumstances favored the secrecy.&#xD;
Her father's house had been built fronting the south and the&#xD;
ocean, according to the custom' then in those parts. But a&#xD;
road afterward having been opened, passing near the back&#xD;
of the dwelling, that part had been arranged and occupied as&#xD;
the front, so that the paternal roof now had, so to speak, two&#xD;
fronts, the one exposed to the public, and the other shaded by&#xD;
an enclosed yard of shrubbery and flowers.&#xD;
This latter way afforded a secluded entrance. Then it&#xD;
being the season when the male portion were nearly all away&#xD;
upon the ocean, great quiet reigned in the settlement. In-&#xD;
deed, the place bore for the time the aspect of a perpetual&#xD;
sabbath.&#xD;
Walter instinctively chose for the time of his visits the&#xD;
hush of the evening, that brief period when the reign of day&#xD;
&#xD;

298             THE FISHER BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
having ceased, and night not yet commenced her career, there&#xD;
is a pause, as if the pulse of nature were ceasing to beat.&#xD;
Exuberant of happiness were these secret love calls of the&#xD;
Fisher Boy. They were all the more purely sweet, from not&#xD;
being exposed to public gaze. There are emotions we care&#xD;
not to share with the public. They lose their aroma by&#xD;
being exhaled, like some delicious beverage.&#xD;
But one evening, on his way to Angeline's, just as he was&#xD;
entering the garden gate, whom should he meet but a neigh-&#xD;
bor, who resided next door to his mother's. How unlucky !&#xD;
He felt the affair must now be out. The apprehension disturbed&#xD;
hot a little the evening's pleasure with the fair girl.&#xD;
The man happened to be a sedate, uncommunicative being,&#xD;
but this visiting of Walter to the house of Angeline, at that&#xD;
time in the evening, attired in his Sunday's best, was suspicious.&#xD;
At least, the secret was too good to be lost to the public. He&#xD;
would fain unlock it for their edification.&#xD;
The news flew over the neighborhood, as if travelling upon&#xD;
the wings of the wind. It burst upon gaping minds, like a&#xD;
summer thunder-gust, setting the tongue of gossip agog, and&#xD;
the whole spirit of the neighborhood ablaze. What more&#xD;
diffusive than the busy-body spirit of a village curiosity?&#xD;
Walter shrank at the thought of his sacred sentiments&#xD;
being thus exposed to grovelling eyes, and himself the burden&#xD;
of an unscrupulous tongue, yet he was not free of that feeling&#xD;
of .vanity, that springs from the consciousness of being in the&#xD;
public eye.&#xD;
But when he found himself the subject of an invidious&#xD;
comparison, he felt stung to the quick.&#xD;
"Angeline's the best girl in the place," said one. "Beauti-&#xD;
ful, good as an angel, the only daughter, the idol of her family,&#xD;
and beloved by everybody. She could take her pick from&#xD;
all the young men at home ; or as to that, get the nicest young&#xD;
&#xD;
man in Boston. She'll hardly take up, I should think, with&#xD;
Walter Carl, and a fisherman."&#xD;
"What think you the old folks 'll say, when they find it&#xD;
out," said another.&#xD;
"The Redcliffs are descended from a superior family. They&#xD;
have always prided themselves greatly upon their quality of&#xD;
blood, and, although they ever show themselves kind and&#xD;
affable to everybody, yet it is easy to perceive, that they are&#xD;
brimful of pride and lofty notions.  The Carl folks I think&#xD;
'll hardly come up to their ideas of social dignity."&#xD;
In the ardor of his sentiments, that narrowed down his&#xD;
perceptions to the single point of solicitude for Angeline's&#xD;
affections, he had not embraced in the horizon of his changing&#xD;
sea, the probable course her parents would shape toward his&#xD;
whishes.&#xD;
But the veil of illusion began to be raised. The uncertainty&#xD;
of his success with Angeline's parents pressed with disquie-&#xD;
tude upon his vision. Thus it ever is in life. One object&#xD;
of the heart gained, another rises, sweeping back the tide of&#xD;
our feelings to the point of trembling Hope.&#xD;
Still, he tried manfully to rise above the clouds of darkness&#xD;
that at times surrounded him. The heart is incredulous of&#xD;
the whisperings of its own dark fate. But the truth was soon&#xD;
to burst forth in noon-tide blaze.&#xD;
One bright morning he met Balec and Jabez, who per-&#xD;
suaded him to go along with them to the haunt of an old for-&#xD;
tune teller in an obscure corner of the town. This shred of&#xD;
humanity had made his appearance in the neighborhood some&#xD;
few months before, as strangely as if he had just dropped down&#xD;
from the clouds, pretending that once knowing the year and&#xD;
day of one's birth, he could cast the horoscope of his star, and&#xD;
deduce from it the whole fortune of his life.&#xD;
The arrival of this interpreter of the Fates, created a&#xD;
&#xD;
GOSSIP.                 299&#xD;

THE FORTUNE TELLER.           301&#xD;
&#xD;
sensation of wonder in the neighborhood. Old women telling&#xD;
fortunes by tea grounds, by cards, by inspection of one's hand,&#xD;
had been among them from time to time, but none before had&#xD;
plunged into the depths of astrology, like this man ; none&#xD;
had invested the subject with so profound mystery and awe.&#xD;
Then everybody testified that the fortunes told by this man&#xD;
had all come out exact. Not less mysterious his means, than&#xD;
startlingly true his revelations. How strange that love of&#xD;
the marvellous in the human breast, that swallows so eagerly&#xD;
the phantoms of its own credulity?&#xD;
Well, this leech-worm of the credulous in poor humanity.,&#xD;
having taken his first gulp from the wave of village curiosity.,&#xD;
had retired to*a miserable hut where he was living in ambigu..&#xD;
ous relations with two females more resembling some weird&#xD;
witches of the darkest times of the past, than respectable&#xD;
beings of civilization.&#xD;
Here he continued to impose his wondrous art upon such&#xD;
as favored him with their presence, and the sum of a quarter&#xD;
of a dollar, as a magnet to turn the key of his mysterious box&#xD;
that opened into the secrets of life. And in spite of the&#xD;
wretched, almost disgraceful character of them, numbers from&#xD;
all parts of the town thronged daily the old astrologer's pre-&#xD;
cints, partly from curiosity, and in part from the diversion to a&#xD;
village life.&#xD;
Balec and Jabez had become infected with the ruling fever,&#xD;
and their social influence over Walter was such as to draw&#xD;
him along with them.&#xD;
They found the old fortune teller blind, but with a pretended&#xD;
inward sight that eclipsed the brightest beam of day-. He&#xD;
cast down his divining rod, and the past, the present, and the&#xD;
future rayed clearly before him. He first began with Balec,&#xD;
then with Jabez. He gave recognizable traits of their char-&#xD;
acter, touched upon past incidents of their lives, then mapped&#xD;
&#xD;
out their future in pleasing lines. The two boys were filled&#xD;
with delight. To see themselves, as in a glass, and reflected,&#xD;
too, in so comely proportions, was gratifying to their self-love.&#xD;
Next came the turn of Walter. His fortune, like the for-&#xD;
tunes of his two companions, were portrayed in flattering&#xD;
colors. The astrologer proceeded, thus gayly until reaching&#xD;
the twenty-second year of the boy, when he suddenly paused&#xD;
in his narration, a shadow passed over his brow, and he&#xD;
hesitated to proceed on. When urged to do so, he intimated&#xD;
that the dark Fates had revealed to him something alarming&#xD;
in the life of the boy at this period. He then suddenly re-&#xD;
called something inadvertently omitted in the portion of the&#xD;
fortune already 'given. It was an incident just about to&#xD;
transpire, something of great significance, and which would&#xD;
change the current of his whole future. The blind revealer&#xD;
dwelt upon this expected incident with so much persistency,&#xD;
and stated minutely so many circumstances connected with&#xD;
it, that Walter could not but refer to his relations with Ange-&#xD;
line. A presentiment of some great disappointment passed&#xD;
over his mind.&#xD;
They all set off in return. Balec and Jabez in buoyant&#xD;
spirits. Walter, thoughtful and downcast, dwelling upon the&#xD;
dark presages of the fortune teller. His mind was in that&#xD;
disturbed state, when the fear of losing the prize we have&#xD;
won, keeps up a painful solicitude, and transforms every&#xD;
doubtful circumstance into an omen of ill.&#xD;
On reaching home, he entered the house in breathless hate.&#xD;
It seemed that the presence of his accustomed apartments&#xD;
would restore equanimity to his mind. When in moments of&#xD;
fervid apprehension upon some critical turn of our fate, the&#xD;
presence of familiar objects, like the society of well known&#xD;
friends, tends to allay excited distrust, and induce that golden&#xD;
serenity, so blessed to tranquillity of soul.&#xD;

BLIGHTED HOPES.              803&#xD;
&#xD;
But on entering his bed-room, a billet upon the table at-&#xD;
tracted the notice of Walter. It came unmistakably from&#xD;
Angeline. The delicate paper, the neat folding, the exquisite&#xD;
address, were all hers. How clearly lay revealed the charac-&#xD;
teristics of her soul upon the awaiting missive. How vividly&#xD;
this golden link in his associations ushered before him the&#xD;
sweet image of the fair girl.&#xD;
He seized it. A tide of feverish impatience rushed through&#xD;
his heart. A shadow of fearful apprehension dimmed his&#xD;
vision. He paused before opening it, as if standing upon a-&#xD;
brink amid some unknown ground, where a step forward&#xD;
must plunge to a fate uncertain.&#xD;
Tearing the seal, the first glance revealed the whole. A&#xD;
vertigo of soul came over him. He sank into a seat, over-*&#xD;
come by his emotions. At length, regaining sufficient com-&#xD;
posure, he read the following lines:&#xD;
DEAREST WALTER :- I am pained in feeling obliged to&#xD;
tell you, that I cannot longer receive your visits. But we&#xD;
will part good friends, and I shall ever pray for your happi-&#xD;
ness.&#xD;
Let us remember the past only as a bright dream, that will.&#xD;
soon melt into the blending future, to be thought of no more.&#xD;
I thank you for all your kind attentions, and subscribe&#xD;
myself, gratefully,      Your friend,&#xD;
ANGELINE."&#xD;
As he finished, a throb of anguish, like an edged sword,&#xD;
pierced anew his spirit. He sank back in deepest misery of&#xD;
soul. If day had been suddenly struck from his sight, the&#xD;
shock to his sensibilities could not' have been more keen.&#xD;
That beautiful world, which but a moment before he embraced&#xD;
with so loving a heart, like the mirage of a sweet dream, had&#xD;
suddenly departed, leaving the darkness of midnight pressing&#xD;
&#xD;
upon his rayless orbs. Ah, how bitter the first pang of&#xD;
blighted hopes !&#xD;
It was long before he became sufficiently soothed to reflect&#xD;
at all upon the subject of the letter. When he did, a tinge&#xD;
of wounded pride seized him, at the bare suspicion of having&#xD;
been jilted by the flattering girl. Indeed, at times, he felt&#xD;
toward her a positive hatred, so violent and sudden were the&#xD;
transitions of his emotions. Wildly restive is the goaded-&#xD;
spirit of youth, before receiving the curb-bit of experience.&#xD;
But on contemplating more closely the import of the letter,&#xD;
he began to believe that its decision was not dictated by the&#xD;
will of Angeline herself. The dawning impression threw a&#xD;
gleam of hope over his darkened spirit.&#xD;
Seizing his pen, with the .eagerness of a desperate man,&#xD;
catching at an object of safety just appeared to view, he&#xD;
addressed a letter to Angeline. A haughty tone of feeling ran&#xD;
through the impassioned lines of the missive, yet there were&#xD;
here and there touches of tender fire, well calculated to melt so&#xD;
generous a heart as Angeline's.&#xD;
The next day, Walter received in reply the following:&#xD;
"DEAREST WALTER : -I fear my brief note of yesterday&#xD;
may have offended you. If so, I tearfully implore your for-&#xD;
giveness. Do not believe that I could willingly wound your&#xD;
feelings. No, my dearest friend, knowingly to give you the&#xD;
slightest pang, would bring the deepest -misery to my distressed&#xD;
spirit.&#xD;
Heaven knows how my poor heart has struggled against the&#xD;
claims of duty; how it has bled at every pore, in being torn&#xD;
from the object of its affections ; how it now lies groaning in&#xD;
the bitterness of its keen sorrow ! But alas! the cherished&#xD;
purpose of the heart seems not our own.&#xD;
From my earliest recollection, I have been taught implicit&#xD;

&#xD;
obedience to parents. This has been the golden rule of my&#xD;
 life. To me it has been a sweet law of love, for my own dear&#xD;
parents have ever proved to me the truest, the kindest, the&#xD;
best of friends. Next to my Maker, I have felt for them the&#xD;
deepest gratitude, the holiest trust. Too wise to err, too&#xD;
good not to consult fny highest happiness, I have ever clung&#xD;
to them with a faith of deepest affection. They have been my&#xD;
sun, my world, my universe of life.  But for once I feel that&#xD;
that they are unkind, harsh, nay, cruel. It seems that they&#xD;
have become suddenly changed; that some evil spirit has 'pos-&#xD;
sessed them to destroy forever the joy of their fond daughter.&#xD;
But they have commanded, and I will obey; for alas, what&#xD;
other course is left for me; what other course consistent with&#xD;
duty, with self-respect; what other course not forbidden alike&#xD;
by the holy precepts of the Bible, by the sacred interests of&#xD;
society, and by the claims of virtue itself.&#xD;
Then let us submit to the stroke that separates us, with&#xD;
trustful resignation. A wise Providence may design it for&#xD;
our greatest good. The sweet rainbow of promise may lie&#xD;
concealed behind the cloud that envelops us, yet joyfully to&#xD;
break forth upon our enraptured gaze. At least, we will place&#xD;
an unshaken faith in the wisdom and goodness of him who&#xD;
doeth all things well.&#xD;
And, now, adieu, my ever&#xD;
dear friend,&#xD;
ANGELINE'&#xD;
P. S. Pardon me for returning with this, all your dear&#xD;
letters.- I would fain preserve them near me, As mementoes of&#xD;
happy days, alas, now flown; but as often as I should see them&#xD;
it would open afresh the wounds of a bleeding heart, and&#xD;
make me more and more miserable."&#xD;
The-perusal of this letter awakened tumultuous emotions in&#xD;
&#xD;
Walter's breast. Yet it allayed his worst fears, and imparted&#xD;
a sweet glow to his feelings.&#xD;
All was now clear to his mind. It was just as his heart had&#xD;
divined. Angeline, as ever, was all his own. Blessed assur-&#xD;
ance! Indeed, this last letter revealed the blissful.truth more&#xD;
brightly than ever. He could almost submit to losing her,&#xD;
as it seemed he must, just to be so clearly assured of her pure,&#xD;
her deep, her abiding affection. Then how noble her senti-&#xD;
ments. It is doubly dear to be beloved when the affection&#xD;
flows from exalted excellence.&#xD;
But her parents, not approving her choice, had interposed&#xD;
their will, and the dear girl, like a good, self-sacrificing, dutiful&#xD;
child as she was, had yielded up her happiness to parental&#xD;
command.&#xD;
In contemplating her course, his feelings were alternately&#xD;
those of pain and joy; of pain, that her affection for him had&#xD;
not impelled her to'break through all obstacles, and rush con-&#xD;
fidingly to his bosom ; of joy to perceive her animated with a&#xD;
spirit so heroic, so self-sacrificing. That she bowed so fully&#xD;
to the shrine of duty, made her all the more lovely to his eyes.&#xD;
The very obstacle that barred his hopes, enhanced her worth.&#xD;
Her sway to principle was the shuttle that wove the shroud of&#xD;
his hopes.&#xD;
But the course of Angeline's parents stung Walter to the&#xD;
quick. The pride of his nature was aroused at the diparage-&#xD;
ment which was implied in this revelation of their sentiments.&#xD;
Yet he could not free himself of the bitter consciousness of his&#xD;
humble condition, and of the despised calling into which he had&#xD;
been thrown by circumstances beyond his control.&#xD;
He spent hours of deep solicitude in pondering upon how&#xD;
could be removed the obstacles that separated him from the&#xD;
object of his love. True, he felt secure of the girl's single&#xD;
affections for the present, but he could not fail to perceive that&#xD;

&#xD;
unless the barrier so cruelly thrust between their free commun-&#xD;
ion, were overcome, the stream of her love that now flowed so&#xD;
purely towards his own breast, must in time, be inevitably&#xD;
turned into another channel.&#xD;
It were hopeless to think of reconciling her parents to his&#xD;
wishes. He could devise no possible way to compass so blessed&#xD;
an end. Their prejudices were too deeply rooted in the un-&#xD;
yielding substratum of human nature to admit of a ray of&#xD;
hope in that direction. Could he succeed, then, in gaining her&#xD;
will to his own, of drawing her into that state of delirious&#xD;
emotion, when a woman, from the ardor of her confiding spirit,&#xD;
flings wildly aside the most sacred ties for her lover, and thus&#xD;
override the firm feelings of her parents ? With a faith&#xD;
springing from the potency of his own affections, he felt able&#xD;
to achieve this.&#xD;
But could he be so unfeeling, as to tear away this pure&#xD;
young girl from the fond arms of those who had given her&#xD;
birth, who had nursed and nurtured her frail existence with&#xD;
the holiest instincts of parental love, united with moral+ and&#xD;
religious principle, until she had blossomed into a lovely&#xD;
flower, throwing beams of sunshine upon the growing shadows&#xD;
of their declining life, and loading with fragrance the very air&#xD;
of their sweet homeside ?  Did she not belong to them by the&#xD;
fullest rights of nature ?  Could he cruelly lay so sacrelegious&#xD;
a hand upon the inviolable ties of family?  Should he ever&#xD;
pardon himself for bringing down an unending gloom upon&#xD;
that roof, which had ever before beamed with domestic joy?&#xD;
Yes, he felt from the depths of his nature that he could do&#xD;
all this. Yet, a slight feeling of revenge, it must be confessed&#xD;
mingled here with the reasonings of his mind. What natural&#xD;
right, he asked himself, had any human being, to interpose an&#xD;
obstacle to the free mutual will of two virtuous hearts, upon a&#xD;
point so momentous, as one affecting their highest happiness,&#xD;
&#xD;
yea, the very moral existence of their whole future. True&#xD;
they were her parents, but was she not given to them for a&#xD;
holier, a higher purpose, than merely to gild their brief span&#xD;
of life. Was not the girl's own happiness, her eternal welfare,&#xD;
the happiness and welfare of the man whom nature had&#xD;
pointed out as her husband, and all the growing and widening&#xD;
relations, that spring out of the married life of a single couple&#xD;
through all coming time - should not all these great and holy&#xD;
interests upon society and the world eclipse the puny prefer-&#xD;
ence of her parents for a few brief moments ? Were they not&#xD;
under the strongest natural obligation - did not the whole&#xD;
tenor of their very religion, teach them unselfishly to consult&#xD;
the child's happiness in preference to their own? Then could,&#xD;
they hope for any success worthy the name, in attempting to&#xD;
resist the great Jaw of nature which binds hearts as it wreaths&#xD;
the sunshine, and is as resistless in its sway as is the incoming&#xD;
of the tidal wave ? But suppose by persistently thwarting&#xD;
the wishes of their child, they finally succeeded in alienating her&#xD;
mind from the object of her heart, how were they ever to com-&#xD;
pensate her for the immeasurable loss they had occasioned&#xD;
her, a loss that might leave her future life strown thick with&#xD;
the blight of a mildew ?  Could any power of parental affec-&#xD;
tion, or any fascination of home delights, which they could&#xD;
ever possibly summon, make amends for depriving her of that&#xD;
one great need of a woman's nature, namely, of beig wedded&#xD;
in love and friendship to the man of her choice ?&#xD;
. They objected to his inferior social position. But what&#xD;
were position, wealth, family connections anywhere, by the side&#xD;
of the moral existence, the social happiness, the affectional&#xD;
life of two truthful natures, just launching upon a sea so&#xD;
momentous. Especially how insignificant were such consider-&#xD;
ations, in a country like ours, with no established classes, and&#xD;

THlE FISER BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
CONJUGAL FELICITY.-&#xD;
&#xD;
where all factitious distinctions are as changing as the ever&#xD;
changing seasons.&#xD;
Besides, might not her parents find themselves mistaken in&#xD;
their conceptions of the boy's character, and in their estimate&#xD;
of what he.was capable of achieving in the future. Might&#xD;
not their views undergo a change, and they come to regret&#xD;
when, alas, too late, their opposition to their daughter's wishes!.1&#xD;
How blind, it must be confessed, are we to the future. How&#xD;
precarious are the brightest schemes of men ! How many&#xD;
golden marriages, shaped by parental wills have early set in&#xD;
gloom.. While how many inauspicious unions formed by will-&#xD;
ing hearts have gradually brightened into prosperity and&#xD;
honor.&#xD;
These were some of the thoughts that crowded the fevered&#xD;
brain of the boy. They strengthened him in the resolution to&#xD;
overcome, or at least, cireumvent the will of Angeline's parents,&#xD;
His conscience once :appeased, the ardor of his affections&#xD;
nerved up his determinations with an energy truly impassioned,&#xD;
and he set to summoning plans for the accomplishment of his&#xD;
purpose.&#xD;
But as he turned the subject over in his mind, new views&#xD;
broke forth. Suppose he could persuade the girl in her ex-&#xD;
cited state 'of emotion, to abandon her parents and fly to his&#xD;
own arms, what would he then find himself in possession of,&#xD;
as the sowmuch coveted' burden of life, a woman, or a partial&#xD;
maniac?   Which would best fill the measure of his love, and&#xD;
satisfy the full cravings of his exalted affections, a woman&#xD;
with all her social relations intact, joyous in the calm serenity&#xD;
of a healthful state of mind, making no earthly sacrifice for&#xD;
him, but rather borrowing lustre from the new relation, or a&#xD;
kind of crazed soul, disjointed and fragmentary, coming to him&#xD;
in a state, that was a species of intoxication, with the loss of&#xD;
&#xD;
much that was most sacred in marriage. He did not fail to&#xD;
perceive that man's heaven of love consists in perfectly pos-&#xD;
sessing a woman that perfectly possesses herself, one that&#xD;
should come to him with no earthly relation severed, no social&#xD;
tie broken by the change, perfectly independent in all her&#xD;
affinities, yet so attuned to his own nature by the sympathy of&#xD;
congenial love, as happily to make the will of him her own.&#xD;
The glory of man's conjugal felicity was to have the sweet&#xD;
mastery of a kindred soul that was strong, self-reliant, and&#xD;
governed by its own free will. It was not a subject, a slave,&#xD;
a mere creature subdued to his own whims, caprice and selfish&#xD;
appetite, that answered his conceptions, but a coequal, a partner,&#xD;
a companion, a friend. He reflected upon which would be&#xD;
most likely to perform with him benignly the voyage of mar-&#xD;
ried life, she who should step into the boat with a calm ex-&#xD;
pectation of the dangers of the sea, and with a tranquil will to&#xD;
meet any fate, or she who had rushed.with infatuation to his&#xD;
side.&#xD;
Then when the frenzy of the moment was over, how&#xD;
would she be likely to be affected with a contemplation of her&#xD;
state. Would she maintain the same happy attachment to his&#xD;
fortunes, or might she not grow weary, and repent her haste?&#xD;
Then, how was he to supply what he had deprived her of,&#xD;
in the loss of her friends? These were, after all, social ties&#xD;
which he could never of his own might, hope to restore.&#xD;
True, the central depth of a woman's love is, or ought to be,&#xD;
in the joy of her husband, but this does not supersede other ties&#xD;
of love and friendship. She may cherish and exercise the&#xD;
warmest affection for all her friends, and take none properly&#xD;
belonging to her husband. Indeed, his store of wealth in his&#xD;
wife's love, is nobly increased by her freedom to strengthen in&#xD;
the bonds of good will the family ties of her youth. The&#xD;
depth of feeling and genial sentiment which she thus acquires&#xD;

&#xD;
are all his own and will concentrate with sweet power upon&#xD;
his daily life. It will create a sunshine upon his family&#xD;
hearth, that will give a brighter spell to home.&#xD;
The man who would cut off his wife from friendly inter-&#xD;
course with her natural friends, hoping thereby to secure her&#xD;
more firmly to himself, makes a fatal mistake. He sins against&#xD;
high heaven, and against the dearest rights of society. If he&#xD;
succeeds, he will only have corrupted the soul that should be&#xD;
the angel of his inner life. He has destroyed with his own,&#xD;
hands, the beauty of his dearest treasure. He has acted the&#xD;
part of.a tyrant ; his course is that of a wretch.&#xD;
But Walter did not feel to accept the whole burden of this&#xD;
reasoning. He would not of his own accord turn Angeline&#xD;
from her parents and friends. He would win her for himself&#xD;
and if they chose to withdraw their friendship, theirs would&#xD;
be the responsibility. Still, he could not get rid of the feel-&#xD;
ing, that -he would be at least the occasion of the rupture.&#xD;
And this sorely troubled him. As he dwelt upon it, the more&#xD;
huge it grew, until he rose to an excited state of mind, and&#xD;
when the contempt with which her parents had treated him&#xD;
Bashed across his mind, he boiled with pride and indignation.&#xD;
A new resolution sprang up in his breast. He would relin-&#xD;
quish forever his claims upon Angeline. Whatever the con-&#xD;
sequences to his future happiness, he would not take her, if he&#xD;
could, on the hard condition of the hatred of her parents and&#xD;
the alienation of her friends. It would be heroically sweet to&#xD;
hug to.his heart this one great grief of his life, and suffer and&#xD;
be strong until h had arisen to a full mastery of his emotional&#xD;
nature ; but to endure the silent reproaches of a bosom com-&#xD;
panion, whose ev ry look would remind him of having robbed&#xD;
her -of her dearest friends, would be more than he -could&#xD;
endure.&#xD;
&#xD;
With this resolution he seized his pen, and wrote the fol-&#xD;
lowing:&#xD;
" DEAREST ANGELINE :- How cruelly has not Fortune&#xD;
frowned upon me. After experiencing the bliss of believing&#xD;
you mine, how excruciating the thought of your being turned&#xD;
from me forever. But it is joy unspeakable to be assured that&#xD;
I still possess your affections, although this joy is mingled with&#xD;
pain to think that the bright light of your love wanes for me,&#xD;
only to delight the pathway of another.&#xD;
" I will not speak harshly of your parents, because they are&#xD;
your dearest friends upon earth ; and for your eake I will&#xD;
drink to its last dregs, this bitterest cup they give me. They&#xD;
think me unworthy of you ; and except in the single purity&#xD;
of my love, I feel from the sincerest depths of my soul, that&#xD;
they are right. But did they know how fondly I doat upon&#xD;
your very existence; could they see the purity of my inten-&#xD;
tions, the sincerity of my heart, the, strength of my love;&#xD;
could they understand how their sweet approbation to the&#xD;
exercise of our mutual love, would fill my bosom with never-&#xD;
ending gratitude, how it would nerve my arm to battle bravely&#xD;
with life, with what devotion I would study your every hap-&#xD;
piness, with what might I would strive to lay the treasures&#xD;
and honors of the world at your feet, - could they believe all&#xD;
these, as I feel them, Iam sure in an excess of tenderness,&#xD;
they would relent, and would show the same alacrity to restore&#xD;
you to my arms, that they now do determination to throw you&#xD;
from my path forever.&#xD;
"Your decision, dear friend, breaks my heart. It strikes&#xD;
the universe of life from my soul. Yet I cannot but bless you&#xD;
from the bottom of my better nature, for being ever true to a&#xD;

your parting embrace ; till then, adieu.&#xD;
" Thine in anguish,&#xD;
"cWALTER."&#xD;
The evening appointed for the parting interview of the&#xD;
unhappy lovers, was as beautifully serene, as their bosoms&#xD;
were disturbed and wretched. How differently now did nature&#xD;
greet his every sense from what she did at his previous visits !&#xD;
Then the spirit of joy pervaded all without as well as within;&#xD;
and the tiniest shrub in his pathway bore him a smile of glad-&#xD;
ness; now everything appeared enshrouded in the dejection&#xD;
that palled his own breast.&#xD;
Angeline met him with a soft step at the garden gate of her&#xD;
father's. She took his arm with a movement of sadness, and&#xD;
the two in the profound depth of their own grief made a turn&#xD;
or two in the adjoining lane. A calm, gentle spirit seemed to&#xD;
breathe in the silvery atmosphere around tlem, but it brought&#xD;
no tranquillity to their throbbing hearts. The moon sailed&#xD;
benignly in the placid heavens, but it lay no balm upon their&#xD;
bruised spirits. Few words were exchanged between them.&#xD;
Their hearts were too full for utterance. Their intercourse&#xD;
was the mute eloquence of feeling. Their parting was the&#xD;
bitter sob of the grave-side. One, a single kiss, the only one,&#xD;
sealed their mutual love. Their maiden lips, met for the first&#xD;
time, in sweet, tender sympathy.&#xD;
The parting over, Walter bounded homeward with rapid&#xD;
gate. A mountain of oppression had been removed from his&#xD;
heart, and from the void that followed, there came a lightness&#xD;
of feeling, that lent wings to his movement.&#xD;
Arrived at home, he threw himself upon his bed in a state&#xD;
of feverish bewilderment. The scenes he had just passed&#xD;
through, had seemed so strange, as to leave a cast of unreality&#xD;
&#xD;
in his emotions. He endeavored with firm purpose to allay&#xD;
the excitement of his mind, and court the gentle balm of sleep,&#xD;
but with his best efforts to the contrary, the fever upon his&#xD;
brain increased, an'd the. dewy morning came bringing no&#xD;
slumber to his restive eyelids. He tossed upon his pillow in&#xD;
hapless woe. Every thought of the past made him more and&#xD;
more wretched, and he silently accused himself for having in&#xD;
his precipitancy to throw off his ties from Angeline, been the&#xD;
executioner of his own happiness.&#xD;
In resolving to part forever with Angeline, he believed to&#xD;
have mastered his own emotions, but how treacherously he&#xD;
had deceived himself. He thought in the act of their separa-&#xD;
tion, he had given proof of an unshaken purpose, but alas&#xD;
how fragile proved this strength of resolution. In a moment&#xD;
of heroic ardor, he believed himself capable of shaking off&#xD;
the fetters that bound him, and pursuing the freedom of his&#xD;
course. But how little he knew his own heart. The very&#xD;
effort he made to rid himself of the thrall of her affections,&#xD;
but bound him to her in double chains. Now cast off hopelessly&#xD;
from her, the image of' the dear girl would rise with increased&#xD;
tenderness; and when the trance of her loveliness came over&#xD;
him, his whole nature sickened with languishing despair.&#xD;
The single thought of how happy he might have-been in the&#xD;
ever sunshine of her love, and how miserable must be his ex-&#xD;
istence without her, overwhelmed him with deepest anguish.&#xD;
He turned to every side with distressed heart, he groaned&#xD;
in bitterness of soul. The day seemed stripped of its beauty,&#xD;
the night disrobed of its loveliness. Appetite fled from him&#xD;
as a gaunt spectre. The faces of friends no longer beamed&#xD;
with joy. Even the sweet voice of his dear mother, seemed&#xD;
to have lost the charm of its tone.&#xD;
To escape human gaze, he flew to the haunts of his youth,&#xD;
to the glorious'sea-side, to catch the low plaint of its ceaseless&#xD;

billow, to the old, welcome pond, to drink of its dreamy&#xD;
quietude, to the venerable red school-house, to invoke the&#xD;
sweet voice of the past. Then he plunged into the'depths of&#xD;
the woody thicket, and there amid the stillness of nature, com-&#xD;
muned, but it was only with the unseen spirits of his haggard&#xD;
thoughts. All was vain essay. The very key-note of his&#xD;
soul was disordered, and every other chord, when touched, only&#xD;
vibrated a mournful dirge.&#xD;
The familiar scenes of his youth became painful to his&#xD;
sense, and he resolved to fly away from home, as the nearest&#xD;
approximation to the escaping from thought.&#xD;
The observant eye of Walter's mother had noticed the sud-&#xD;
den attachment of Walter to Angeline; and during the whole&#xD;
of his relations with the beautiful girl, nothing had escaped&#xD;
her vigilant eye. She felt proud of his choice, but with a&#xD;
fuller knowledge of human nature than her son, she was&#xD;
troubled with a keen solicitude for his success, and now, that&#xD;
the rupture was apparent, she felt how well grounded had&#xD;
been her worst apprehensions. As she saw her, beloved son&#xD;
thus blighted in his pure affections, and lying prostrate like a&#xD;
bruised.reed, in the pathway, her heart was moved with com-&#xD;
miseration. She longed to unburthen herself in sympathy&#xD;
with her afflicted child, but a profound delicacy forbid  and as&#xD;
for the boy, no treasure of earth could. have induced him to&#xD;
share his secret sentiments even with his confiding mother.&#xD;
The cause of his disappointment was but too plain; and that&#xD;
her darling son should be thus rejected because of his humble&#xD;
life, aroused her proud spirit to the fullest measure of feeling.&#xD;
She felt a positive indignation towards the authors of her&#xD;
son's unhappiness. But when she reflected upon the past,&#xD;
her own course arose in self-condemnation. She bitterly&#xD;
reproached herself for having so selfishly urged him into a&#xD;
career of life, that had so sadly compromised his fortune, and&#xD;
&#xD;
LEAVING HOME,                    315&#xD;
bid fair to wreck his happiness. What would she not now&#xD;
give to recall the past. But the bond was now broken, that&#xD;
held him to her footsteps. She was now willing, yea eager,&#xD;
that he should go from her-should launch upon the broadest&#xD;
ocean of life, encounter all its hardships, hazard all its snares,&#xD;
if with the prospect of conquering a position, and reclaiming&#xD;
his happiness.&#xD;
With considerable difficulty, a release was at length effected&#xD;
from the vessel to which he was bound, and Walter, with a&#xD;
swelling heart, bid a tender adieu to his home. Yet the fare-&#xD;
well with his mother lacked its usual expressive fervor. No&#xD;
tears were shed; few words were uttered. A deep, control-&#xD;
ling sentiment, mutually comprehended, but which neither&#xD;
dared reveal to the other, seemed to embarrass emotion, and&#xD;
 set a barrier to that natural flow of feeling which is the elo-&#xD;
quence of human affection.&#xD;
But if the profound grief, which in Walter absorbed every&#xD;
other sentiment, checked for the monient the deep current of&#xD;
his filial love, Mrs. Carl was affected by far other feelings.&#xD;
Remorse for having vainly compromised the happiness of her&#xD;
son, bitter pride toward those who were so acutely wringing&#xD;
his pure heart, and driving him hopelessly from her presence,&#xD;
together with an irresistible presentiment, that she was never&#xD;
more to see his dear face, paralyzed the very chords of mater-&#xD;
nal affection, and implanted sentiments too poignant for utter-&#xD;
ance. Yet, if upon her brow there sat a marble placidity, as&#xD;
if in resignation to the will of fate, far below, in the depths of&#xD;
her soul, were breaking into flame those corroding fires that&#xD;
slowly eat out the love of life.&#xD;

BYRON.&#xD;
WALTER stepped upon the wharf in New York city from&#xD;
the vessel upon which he had made thither his passage from&#xD;
home, with a movement of forced alacrity. He embraced&#xD;
greedily the change from the dreary passage of the way, with&#xD;
time unoccupied save by nursing the cruel feelings that were&#xD;
torturing his breast, and yet no definite aim of life lent health-&#xD;
ful energy to his step toward the future, and. he seemed pin-&#xD;
ioned to the baleful present by the sentiment that centred,&#xD;
hopelessly, his thoughts upon the happy past.&#xD;
Roaming aimlessly through the streets of this vast metrop-&#xD;
olis of the new world, not knowing (not much caring) if he&#xD;
might at the next step become inextricably bewildered amid&#xD;
the mazes of its interminable windings, and the vortices of its&#xD;
human currents, now sauntering amid the forest of shipping,&#xD;
those magic carriers over the mighty ocean ; now seeking to&#xD;
beguile a weary moment in some grateful park, that smile&#xD;
of nature amid the din of art, he soon began to feel in its full&#xD;
force, that sharpest of all dreary feelings, the profound loneli-&#xD;
ness of being in a crowd, of being amid an ocean of human&#xD;
beings, without one in the countless host with a bosom beat-&#xD;
ing responsive to his own.&#xD;
(316)&#xD;
&#xD;
He strove to dissipate the dejection pressing upon his&#xD;
bosom, by contemplating the splendid development of civiliza-&#xD;
tion around him, and in enlisting his admiration for the genius&#xD;
of man in the noble works of art that greeted his eyes. But&#xD;
it was a fruitless effort. The better sentiments of his heart&#xD;
tinged the brightest thoughts of his mind, and left him in a&#xD;
state of gloomy misanthropy.&#xD;
Finding no solace in the crowded mart where he was, an&#xD;
impulse seized him to plunge off from this dense focus of civil-&#xD;
ization to the precincts of human society, that happily he&#xD;
might.find amid the solitudes of nature that balm which was&#xD;
denied him among the haunts of men.&#xD;
After much discouraging enquiry and looking around, he at&#xD;
length found a passage on board a lake boat, so termed, mak-&#xD;
ing trips between New York city and Seneca Lake, a beau-&#xD;
tiful expanse of water in the interior of the State. The pic-&#xD;
turesque, and at times sublime scenery, upon the banks of&#xD;
the noble and majestic Hudson; the long reaching Erie Canal,&#xD;
that first grand link between the bustling East, and the rising&#xD;
West, and a glorious monument of the genius, energy and&#xD;
perseverance of man ; the verdant, teeming earth yielding every-&#xD;
where of her generous bounty ; and the evidences all around,&#xD;
of thrift, of rapid prosperity that greeted his eyes, as he was&#xD;
conveyed along upon the route; served to divert his mind&#xD;
from the feelings that were brooding over his soul, and at times&#xD;
to impart a buoyancy to his spirit; but they brought no per-&#xD;
manent peace to his distracted bosom.&#xD;
Finding the winter to commence setting in with premoni-&#xD;
tory rigor, he returned hastily to New York city, and there&#xD;
engaged himself as first officer in a schooner bound for the&#xD;
South. Taking so responsible a position was rather a bold&#xD;
stroke for one of his tender years and -poverty of experience&#xD;
in nautical life, but so long idleness had made him impatient&#xD;

&#xD;
for occupation, and there had gradually sprung up in his&#xD;
bosom a species of desperation that imparted a reckless tinge&#xD;
to his character.&#xD;
During the first part of his passage, the severe and exact-&#xD;
ing duties of his new state absorbed his full energies, and&#xD;
ruled out in a good degree the bitter sentiments of the past;&#xD;
but when they approached the crescent coast of the Mexican&#xD;
Gulf, the soft airs that impregnated the sunny clime, breath-&#xD;
ing a sweet tenderness; the serene and lovely beauty that&#xD;
floated in the air, and brooded with dove-like wings over the&#xD;
water ; the gorgeous, voluptuous skies, redolent with passionate&#xD;
hues ; and especially the low, sandy coast, covered with pine&#xD;
so exactly resembling that of his home ; all were so inspiring&#xD;
of the very spirit of love, as to induce an excess of his pas-&#xD;
sion, and overwhelm his soul with a torrent of languishing&#xD;
regrets.&#xD;
After touching at several American ports upon the Gulf&#xD;
coast, the vessel proceeded up the Mississippi to New Orleans.&#xD;
There appeared much in the character of the people, and in&#xD;
the scenery of the places through which they passed, to seize&#xD;
forcibly the attention of one so ingenious as Walter. He was&#xD;
livelily struck with that northern element of character engraft-&#xD;
ed upon a southern trunk, throwing up for the time its home&#xD;
principles, feigning indifference -to the surrounding institutions,&#xD;
and forgetful of all, save driving for the main chance of&#xD;
getting.&#xD;
On arriving at New Orleans, the object being secured for&#xD;
which he bound himself to the vessel, he obtained a release.&#xD;
Here Mr. Carl very naturally fell into the company of other&#xD;
mates, boarding ashore, who drew him into their society out of&#xD;
pure craving for companionship. The young man as a diver-&#xD;
sion participated very freely with the lively shore pranks of&#xD;
these seamen adrift, bat his heart was too pre-occupied for&#xD;
&#xD;
their often questionable manners to leave any stain upon his&#xD;
pure mind.&#xD;
lie hailed the opening of spring with gladness, as bringing&#xD;
a period of change, and getting on board a steamer, was speed-&#xD;
ily conveyed many hundred miles up the river to Pittsburg.&#xD;
The novel and striking features of this vast inland passage&#xD;
kept his mind in an intense state of curiosity and interest, and&#xD;
he at times seemed being conveyed to a new sphere of exist-&#xD;
ence.&#xD;
The route from Pittsburg to Erie lay over a rough and&#xD;
slippery country, and the comical incidents by the way, with&#xD;
the squibs and cracks of the jovial stage party, lent a zest to&#xD;
this mode of travelling entirely new to Walter. Departing from&#xD;
Erie, and coasting the silvery lake, after one or two startling&#xD;
upsets, they reached Buffalo, blessing their stars for so safe&#xD;
a deliverance.&#xD;
To find a bustling city, with docks crowded with vessels, and&#xD;
quays covered with merchandise, at so remote a point from&#xD;
the ocean, in the midst of what Walter had been accustomed&#xD;
to imagine an interminable forest, seemed, to his astonished&#xD;
eye, some magic picture transformed to life.&#xD;
There were in the harbor two or three vessels of the re-&#xD;
maining squadron of the immortal Perry, being employed in&#xD;
the general business of transportation. Walter could not but&#xD;
contemplate with deep interest these proud vestiges of Ameri-&#xD;
can prowess; and he thought it ignoble that they should be thus&#xD;
retained for the ordinary purposes of commerce, after so bril-&#xD;
liant and signal a career. His youthful patriotism would have&#xD;
preferred to see them inviolable from the sordid touch of gain,&#xD;
a spirit so rooted in the American mind. As he revolved&#xD;
over the glorious battle of Lake Erie, other sublime scenes in&#xD;
the struggles of our nation came to mind, and he could not&#xD;
but envy those who had nobly fallen in efence of their coun-&#xD;

&#xD;
try, and thus earned a niche in the temple of Fame, and a place&#xD;
in the heart of a grateful country. How sweet, could he find a&#xD;
death so happy!&#xD;
His morning and evening walks were upon the pier of the&#xD;
harbor, stretching into the divided waters of the Lake. How&#xD;
novel to his view, and yet how beautiful, lay the broad ex-&#xD;
panse before him, dotted here and there by some winged sail&#xD;
or shooting steamer. There is nothing more soothing to the&#xD;
troubled heart than a silent stroll by the sea-side.&#xD;
But as the fretted waves dashed against the granite walls of&#xD;
the pier upon which he was standing, the complaining surges&#xD;
brought up reminiscences of his own native shores; reminis-&#xD;
cences at once so tender and sorrowful, that, in an excess of&#xD;
emotion, he could have yielded his body-to the merciful wave&#xD;
before him, there to forget in the sweet oblivion of death the&#xD;
wretchedness that was blighting his heart.&#xD;
Leaving Buffalo, that gateway between the East and the&#xD;
West, he visited several of the. ports that are scattered upon&#xD;
the coast, stretching around the lake ; then, after strolling&#xD;
leisurely a-foot to .the Ohio River, he sailed fleetly down the&#xD;
swift gliding stream, and, at length found himself, pennyless.&#xD;
and dejected, in the big, bustling city of Cincinnati.&#xD;
None, save those who may have experienced it, can imagine&#xD;
the mortal disquietude that seizes upon one, on finding him-&#xD;
self friendless and without money, far away from his home.&#xD;
The splendid, teeming world seems an overflowing banquet&#xD;
from which in his abject poverty he is shut out, for the lack&#xD;
of one little key to unlock the door of entrance.&#xD;
But Walter, however much a prey to the innate grief that&#xD;
seemed consuming him, was not one to yield to any ordinary&#xD;
vicissitudes of life. Spuyious natures, are they who, when&#xD;
overtaken by some great misfortune, in a fit of desperation,&#xD;
give way to courses of ruin. A genuine character yields&#xD;
&#xD;
never to the shocks of fate, but like some royal mountain oak,&#xD;
every blast from the gale that rides upon the storm, but sends&#xD;
still deeper the roots that uphold its majestic trunk.&#xD;
After a good deal of search in quest of some honest em-&#xD;
ployment, he at last engaged himself as pilot, or steers-man,&#xD;
on board a canal-boat making semi-monthly trips between&#xD;
Cincinnati and a small city some fifty-four miles north of the&#xD;
queen city of the West.&#xD;
The captain of the boat had an aspect so forbidding, that&#xD;
Walter would have hesitated making the man's acquaintance&#xD;
at all, but for the sore pressure of need that drove him to seek&#xD;
employment. With a Carolina sun-burnt skin drawn over a&#xD;
huge Kentucky frame, and eyes small, half open and wretchedly&#xD;
inexpressive, there was withal a surly mastiff look about the&#xD;
face, that made one almost tremble to approach him.&#xD;
But nothing is more deceptive than appearances. Those&#xD;
who pretend to read the "mind's construction in the face,"&#xD;
would in this instance have signally failed; for this man&#xD;
beneath an uncouth and harsh exterior, bore a nature as-kindly&#xD;
and genial as could be found among human kind. Walter in&#xD;
his need for sympathy, nestled to the very heart of the stran-&#xD;
ger, and felt almost happy in his warm society. The boatman&#xD;
was also very intelligent, ever conversing in moments of&#xD;
leisure, which were many (for he was none of your greedy&#xD;
drivers in the mart of business, but took the world "fair and&#xD;
easy,") upon History, Biography and Science  There was a&#xD;
philosophic tone in all he said, mingled with a fine common&#xD;
sense, that quite captivated Walter.&#xD;
But the man was thoroughly an infidel, and his sceptical&#xD;
speculations which seemed to pervade the whole character of&#xD;
his mind, came near working the ruin of Walter, and of prov-&#xD;
ing of serious loss to the man himself. For the sophistic&#xD;
reasonings of the boatman, came gradually to unloose the&#xD;

822                THE FISHER BOY.&#xD;
moorings of Walter to the great truth of a future accounta-&#xD;
bility; and as he contemplated the inequalities of human con-&#xD;
dition, and the apparent injustice in the distribution of the&#xD;
gifts of fortune, he began to ,lose by degrees that nice sense&#xD;
of the sacredness of personal integrity, and the firm principle&#xD;
to persevere uncomplainingly amid the hardest vicissitudes of&#xD;
our lot. Indeed, at times, he began to sigh for an opportunity&#xD;
to carve out for himself, by some sudden stroke of daring,&#xD;
what he fancied his share of the world's good things. Such&#xD;
opportunity ere long appeared.&#xD;
The business of the boat upon which Walter was engaged,&#xD;
consisted in transporting produce, chiefly flour and whiskey,&#xD;
from the interior town whence she started, to Cincinnati, and&#xD;
in conveying, on her return, goods for the merchants of the&#xD;
place. The captain being empowered to receive the pay for&#xD;
the sale of the produce that he took to market, and being fre-&#xD;
quently entrusted with considerable sums by the merchants in&#xD;
his place, to meet their payments in Cincinnati, it would not&#xD;
unfrequently happen for him to have upon his person a large&#xD;
sum of money. Whether from a habit of culpable negligence,&#xD;
or from perfect confidence in the immovable honesty of&#xD;
Walter, the captain was at times grossly careless in the keep-&#xD;
ing of this trust, leaving often his pocket-book crowded with&#xD;
bills 'in the pocket of a loose garment thrown off in the hurry&#xD;
of the moment upon the transom of the cabin of the boat,&#xD;
while he was himself away for hours. Generally, however,&#xD;
on leaving the boat, or at night, before retiring, he was careful&#xD;
to place the treasure in a small closet, lock the door, and&#xD;
take the key with him. ,&#xD;
Once in particular, a lion temptation sprang upon Walter&#xD;
to seize this pocket-book, and fly with its contents as his own&#xD;
possession to some place of safety. He had not much diffi-&#xD;
culty in reconciling his conscience to the bold theft. Was not&#xD;
&#xD;
A TEMPTATION.                  323&#xD;
the world, mused he, a matter of chance, and death an eternal&#xD;
sleep ? Right and wrong were mixed up here below in&#xD;
strange confusion, the wrong greatly preponderating.  He&#xD;
then was a fool who would submit to plod wearily through&#xD;
life, and neglect the opportunity to seize his share of this&#xD;
world's goods. Then, the loss would not fall upon his friend,&#xD;
the captain ; it would be shared by many who would not feel&#xD;
it much, and who, more likely than not, had obtained their&#xD;
possessions in a manner quite as questionable as the act he&#xD;
was revolving would be.&#xD;
The opportunity for escape was all that could be wished,&#xD;
the probability of detection merely nothing. He could take a&#xD;
time, when the captain would be absent from the boat for some&#xD;
time, hasten with the money to a broker's for exchange, step&#xD;
on board of a steamer, as one or more was leaving for be-&#xD;
low at almost every moment in the day, and take ship from&#xD;
New Orleans to Europe. There were no telegraphic spirits&#xD;
then to travel faster than the swiftest steamer down a rapid&#xD;
current, and cut off retreat.&#xD;
Then what a sweet revenge would he not take upon those&#xD;
at his home, who had contemned his poverty, as he should&#xD;
appear among them, rustling with wealth and with the lustre&#xD;
of foreign travel upon his brow. How sweet it would be to&#xD;
flood with joy the heart of his mother, with so brilliant a&#xD;
return; and to have the means of placing her above want,&#xD;
and in a position equal with the best in the neighborhood.&#xD;
How he came by his money would be no matter. People&#xD;
never ask how a person obtained his substance, but is he&#xD;
wealthy ?&#xD;
What helped to work up Walter's mind to the daring&#xD;
thought that held possession of him, was the lowly, abject con-&#xD;
dition of poverty in which he found himself, contrasted with&#xD;
the wealth and splendor that passed daily before his eyes.&#xD;

824              THE FISHER BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
Plenty and happiness seemed emptying their horn into the&#xD;
cup of every one but himself., He alone was cursed to crawl&#xD;
like a worm upon the slimy earth. He did not perceive that&#xD;
his own state was that of the million; that we are prone rather&#xD;
to look up'with envy, than down with gratitude ; that the suc-&#xD;
cessful were often in a worse bondage of fear of losing what,&#xD;
they possessed, than he could be in despair of getting where-&#xD;
withal for comfort.&#xD;
At any rate, he pursued his thought ; he actually took steps&#xD;
to carry it into execution, not that he had fully resolved to&#xD;
commit the deed, but he wished to see how easily he could do&#xD;
it, if he would.&#xD;
Scrutinizing the lock of the door which shut up the money,&#xD;
he purchased another so nearly like it, that the key just fitted&#xD;
that in the door. Taking a time when the captain would&#xD;
surely be absent for half a day, at least, he ran across the city,&#xD;
found a steamer, just ready to leave for New Orleans; and&#xD;
directly on his way was a broker, who would exchange his&#xD;
money for gold, or give him .a draft upon a responsible house&#xD;
in Europe. He went to the closet. There was the pocket&#xD;
book, stuffed with bank bills to the amount of several thou-&#xD;
sands. It was but the resolution of a moment, but he could&#xD;
not take the momentous step. His hand was stayed from the&#xD;
dreadful fate that overtakes sooner or later, him who lays&#xD;
violent hands upon what is not his own. At one moment, it&#xD;
was the pure image of his mother rising in pleading tones ; at&#xD;
another, the sweet face of Angeline that made him loathe the&#xD;
turpitude of the act. He was not held, back by any nice&#xD;
scruples of conscience. The fear of a future retribution did&#xD;
not appal him. But all the moral influences and education&#xD;
of his youth arose in solid phalanx, and locked him, as in a&#xD;
vice, from the dark deed.&#xD;
As he put back the money, closed the door, and sprang&#xD;
&#xD;
ashore, a fresh feeling of relief and an elevating consciousness&#xD;
of strength rushed sparklingly through his bosom ; and the&#xD;
noble glow of gratitude that suffused his breast, at the glorious&#xD;
thought that he had been able to rise above so great tempta-&#xD;
tion, and vindicate the royalty of human nature within him,&#xD;
he would not have exchanged for the wealth of a continent.&#xD;
The boat continued leisurely to make her plodding trips.&#xD;
At the town where she stopped, at the end of the route, and&#xD;
the residence of the captain, - a place which for convenience&#xD;
We will call Montville, there was usually a rest of a week or&#xD;
more. In this time Walter stayed on board the boat, but took&#xD;
his meals at the captain's. At first there was much in the&#xD;
quaint features of the city -for city it was, though a very&#xD;
small one -it being more than half Dutch, and in the locali-&#xD;
ties about the region, to interest the young man. Then the&#xD;
captain would sometimes take him out to ride, to visit some&#xD;
noble forest or golden harvest-field, or, perchance, a horse race,&#xD;
or other Western amusement.&#xD;
When not thus diverted, he spent the time on the boat read-&#xD;
ing, or reflecting upon his unhappy lot.&#xD;
One afternoon, as Walter was sitting upon the bow of the&#xD;
boat in a dejected state of mind, a covy of little girls came&#xD;
tripping merrily along. Apparently, they had just been let&#xD;
out of school, and they looked as blithesome as an uncaged&#xD;
bird. What more gladsome than a troup of school-girls ring-&#xD;
ing their joyous choral voices upon the greeting air.&#xD;
As the artless bevy were passing the young man, they fell&#xD;
into a sportive mood, and began dallying with the ropes that&#xD;
bound the boat, to the shore. Presently one of them, a miss&#xD;
of nine or ten summers got a rope so coiled around her, that&#xD;
she could not extricate herself from it. In her helpless plight,&#xD;
she intuitively east an imploring look toward Walter. The&#xD;
young man stepped quietly ashore, gently uncoiled the rope&#xD;

from the trembling girl, and thus set the captive free. The&#xD;
fair damsel finding herself so nicely taken from her condition&#xD;
of alarm, breathed her thanks to her deliverer, and bestowing&#xD;
upon Walter a sweet, earnest look of gratitude, ran off joy-&#xD;
ously.with her companions.&#xD;
The next day, the same girls appeared; and the one whom&#xD;
Walter, the day previous, had befriended, whose name was&#xD;
Adelgitha, brought along with her a beautiful bouquet of.&#xD;
flowers, as a token of grateful remembrance for Walter.&#xD;
This or a similar gift was often repeated; and every day&#xD;
the little school-misses were sure to pass the boat on their way&#xD;
to and from school. The company would occasionally be&#xD;
varied, but Adelgitha was sure to be among the number, the&#xD;
first to greet Walter on coming, and the last to bid him adieu.&#xD;
Indeed his casual acquaintance with the girl soon grew into a&#xD;
budding friendship ; and not unfrequently would she hie her-&#xD;
self away from merry companions and spend an entire Satur-&#xD;
day afternoon with Walter upon the boat. Sometimes he&#xD;
would assist her in the preparation of her lessons; and then&#xD;
she had ever a thousand eager questions to ask him about the&#xD;
wonders of the sea.&#xD;
The charming society of the beautiful little maiden was&#xD;
very sweet to Walter. She was a bright ray of sunshine in&#xD;
his gloomy pathway.&#xD;
At that unconscious age, before the maidenly feelings have&#xD;
imparted a coy grace to the woman, her openness of manner,&#xD;
her confiding, unsuspecting spirit was all the more delightful&#xD;
to the friendless young man. She would sit for hours leaning&#xD;
upon his arm, her large, dreamy eyes occasionally suffused&#xD;
with tenderness, listening to the witching narratives of Walter,&#xD;
while he, warming with the glow of enthusiasm, was but too&#xD;
happy to find so devoted a listener.&#xD;
One afternoon, while reclining in the cabin, a prey to boding 5&#xD;
&#xD;
thoughts, he was startled by a wild shriek, and a dull splash-&#xD;
ing sound, followed by a piercing cry of alarm. Springing out&#xD;
of the cabin, and upon the tow-path, he was in a moment at&#xD;
the scene of disaster. He found there a band of little chil-&#xD;
dren in the wildest frenzy of excitement, now shrieking for&#xD;
aid and now wringing their hands in deep agony. Darting&#xD;
his eyes upon the bosom of the canal, he caught a glimpse of&#xD;
some article of clothing dimly visible just beneath the surface&#xD;
of the opaque waters of the canal. Quick as thought, he&#xD;
sprang in, seized the drowning girl, and, in a moment, bore&#xD;
her safely to land. By the time he reached the bank, a crowd&#xD;
had gathered round ; and overcome more by undue excite-&#xD;
ment than by over exertion, he yielded up his fair burden to&#xD;
humane hands stretched out so eagerly for succor. As they&#xD;
lay aside her dripping locks, how his heart throbbed with joy,&#xD;
to perceive that it was his sweet little friend Adelgitha, that&#xD;
he had been so fortunate as to rescue from a watery grave!&#xD;
But the thoughtless rabble hurried the girl off, without so&#xD;
much as thanking her preserver ; and Walter returned to the&#xD;
boat, feeling happy beyond expression to have been the means&#xD;
of saving his little friend ; but somewhat chagrined at the&#xD;
treatment he had received at the hands of the crowd.&#xD;
Weeks passed, and the autumnal sickly season approached.&#xD;
Disease, like an insatiate archer, began stalking through the&#xD;
city, and entering one fair dwelling after another. Among&#xD;
others, the family of the boat captain was struck down. The&#xD;
captain himself soon after shared the same fate.  Walter&#xD;
could now no longer board at the captain's, and he commenced&#xD;
taking his meals at the tavern. At length Walter was him-&#xD;
self struck with that scourge of the West, namely, fever and&#xD;
ague; only in his case, it was complicated with other dreadful&#xD;
symptoms. At times, he was almost sick to the death. But&#xD;
if his body was shaken with torture, his soul was doubly&#xD;

racked. With no friendly arm to allay his pains; no kindly&#xD;
voice to assuage his griefs ; suffering from inward distress,&#xD;
with a gloom lying like a thick pall upon the future, into what&#xD;
a midnight of darkness was he not thrust. At length, a neigh-&#xD;
boring woman, reduced to abject poverty by a drunken hus-&#xD;
band, came to him, bestowed upon him tones of sympathy,&#xD;
and proffered him succor. Walter was surprised, that she&#xD;
who could scarcely find sustenance for herself and family,&#xD;
should be the first to offer him aid. He did not then know&#xD;
that active sympathy is more frequently found with the lowly&#xD;
than with the high; that they who have suffered themselves,&#xD;
know well how to feel for others, and that often he who has&#xD;
but a little, feels more lively the impulses of giving, than he&#xD;
who can boast of much.&#xD;
Walter ere long was removed to the tavern kept by two&#xD;
vixen sisters. Here he was thrust into an attic room of the&#xD;
house, upon a bed of straw, and there left to chew the cud of&#xD;
misfortune, at his leisure ;- and what with steeping in catnip&#xD;
tea, and much shaking and sweating with his disease, he felt at&#xD;
times to be near shuffling off this mortal coil; nor did he much&#xD;
care for such a summary result. But bye and bye, a down-&#xD;
East doctor, having patients in. the house, happening to stray&#xD;
to Walter's precincts, took at once a lively interest in his case.&#xD;
lie had the young man removed to a lower room, and well&#xD;
cared for. From that time, Walter began rapidly to recover.&#xD;
Blessed be the quality of the human, heart that can thus&#xD;
embrace a brother in a distant land I&#xD;

Count and Madame Radesky were-noble Polish Exiles. In&#xD;
their own country, they had become obnoxious to the Russian&#xD;
government, for having evinced too warm sympathy with their&#xD;
patriotic countrymen. In consequence, their princely estate&#xD;
had been confiscated, and they themselves warned to leave the&#xD;
country. Afterwards, however, the Russian Minister perceiv-&#xD;
ing how strongly entrenched were these excellent people in the&#xD;
affections of all classes in Poland, revoked the hard decree, so&#xD;
far as to allow the doomed couple to remain, and to enjoy a&#xD;
portion of their estate, on condition of their making important&#xD;
concessions of their principles. This, these patriotic and spir-&#xD;
ited people- refused to submit to ; and gathering up what little,&#xD;
remained to them of their personal effects, they immediately&#xD;
sought a home in the New World.&#xD;
Count Radesky finding himself in the necessity of resorting&#xD;
to some means for family sustenance, opened a beautiful floral&#xD;
garden for public exhibition in Cincinnati, Ohio. This proved&#xD;
very congenial to their mutual taste for flowers and for the&#xD;
&#xD;
science of Botany, a taste which by culture had almost grown&#xD;
to a passion. They thus found themselves very happy in their&#xD;
worldly prosperity ; and amid the joys of the outward and&#xD;
inward world, little Adelgitha was born unto them; but all&#xD;
sublunary joys are uncertain, and in a little time from their&#xD;
successful establishment in the new world, that memorable&#xD;
flood of the Ohio River, which is still remembered to have&#xD;
happened, inundated their gardens, and swept in a single day,&#xD;
their little store of all to destruction. Now reduced to great&#xD;
extremity, they were, however, so fortunate as to find a friend&#xD;
who advanced them a sum sufficient to purchase a small farm,&#xD;
which was their present home. The Count proved not to be&#xD;
one of those persons who because highly born affect to despise&#xD;
labor, and who will resort to almost any means of support,&#xD;
rather than sully the hand with weary toil. And his wife,&#xD;
though very beautiful, and possessed of rare accomplishments,&#xD;
having been reared in the very lap of refinement, took a sin-&#xD;
cere pleasure in yielding cheerfully to vicissitudes, and an hon-&#xD;
est pride in grappling with difficulties, while uniting her&#xD;
energies with those of her husband in achieving an independent&#xD;
home. They belonged to that very small class who act upon&#xD;
the beautiful truth, that exalted character can in no wise be&#xD;
affected by the necessities of mere human employment, and&#xD;
that the lustre of a genuine lady or gentleman is sure to beam&#xD;
forth even from under the lowliest guise of life.&#xD;
After a time, unexpected gifts from relatives and friends in&#xD;
their mother country enabled them to enlarge their acres and&#xD;
adorn their dwelling, which with their own efforts and the&#xD;
rise of real estate had brought them to possess at this time&#xD;
by far the most beautiful and valuable estate in all that part&#xD;
of the country.&#xD;
It was in this family, that Walter now found himself installed,&#xD;
as if by magic. And everything in his new home subserved&#xD;

to render his stay happy in the highest degree. The Count&#xD;
and Madam Radesky lived together upon terms of the most&#xD;
perfect connubial affection. While the sentiment between&#xD;
them did not ever take to itself flattering airs of fondness, so&#xD;
did it not break out at times in an eddying current of mutual&#xD;
displeasure.  The stream  of their love was too deep and&#xD;
placid in its flow, to show itself in ripples upon the surface.&#xD;
Their union being the result of mutual choice, misfortune had&#xD;
still further deepened and united their common sympathies.&#xD;
Although now possessed of independent means, and still at&#xD;
the head of large business operations, the Count had not be-&#xD;
come engrossed by the sordid love of money. Early culture,&#xD;
a literary taste, a passion for the fine arts and for nature, united&#xD;
with an affection for the amenities of social life, came to his&#xD;
relief and kept up a happy balance between the spirit of ac-&#xD;
quisition, and the love of exalted enjoyment. And his house&#xD;
was the focus of the culture and intelligence for miles around.&#xD;
Their little daughter Adelgitha was being brought up as we&#xD;
should suppose a child would be, by parents of so fine intelli-&#xD;
gence and justness of judgment as possessed Madame and&#xD;

of their matrimonial love, with the deepest parental solicitude.&#xD;
Not only did they give themselves with the utmost truthful-&#xD;
ness of effort to the just unfolding of her youthful intellect,&#xD;
but they guarded with ,more than argus eyes all those little&#xD;
influences that thickly surround childhood, and gradually&#xD;
temper the susceptible soul to a moulding that is only fully&#xD;
revealed in future years. But they did not seek to force an&#xD;
arbitrary growth of the mind, but allowed the shoots of intel-&#xD;
ligence to spring up spontaneously into the genial sunlight,&#xD;
limiting the supply to healthful nourishment, and guarding&#xD;
it from noxious influences.&#xD;
Walter could not but be as happy as possible in his new&#xD;
&#xD;
home. He was treated by the whole family with all the deli-&#xD;
cacy and kindness that generous and grateful natures could&#xD;
prompt. - There beamed in the  air that surrounded him a&#xD;
light of joy, of refinement, of elevated intelligence that flooded&#xD;
his own bosom with sunshine. Indeed, in time he became too&#xD;
happy, falling into that infatuation of illusion, that haunts the&#xD;
breast of the caged bird, which peers out upon the blooming&#xD;
verdure of nature, and fancies that every shrub in the broad&#xD;
world will bear it the same sweet welcome, that it is ever re-&#xD;
ceving from the fond hand of affection in its own gilded elysium.&#xD;
There was no one feature of adornment to the residence of&#xD;
Count Radesky, that contributed more fully to absorb Walter's&#xD;
interest, than that gentleman's library. It was quite volumi-&#xD;
nious and the selections had been made with great care,&#xD;
bringing together nearly all the really choice works of all&#xD;
nations and times.&#xD;
Walter was from the first a frequent visitor to this sacred&#xD;
tomb of embalmed spirits ; and from cursory perusals of such&#xD;
authors as chanced to hit his fancy or taste, he became more&#xD;
and more enlisted, until at length his whole soul got fired with&#xD;
the passion for reading. His mental acumen grew in the end&#xD;
so intense, that he actually devoured the divine food so abun-&#xD;
dant before him; and his sharpened faculties, instead of get-&#xD;
ting satiated, only waxed stronger and keener with the aliment&#xD;
upon which they fed. He felt an expansion of mind, an en-&#xD;
largement of soul, a refreshing of spirit, a thrill of delight,&#xD;
that opened upon his intellectual vision like the joy of a new&#xD;
birth, as he began more and more to comprehend the master&#xD;
spirits of bygone centuries -those true kings in the vast&#xD;
empire of mind, -- to fathom with them the profound depths&#xD;
of philosophy, to dive into the hidden secrets of nature, to soar&#xD;
amid the brilliant realms of imagination, and to tread the&#xD;
flowery meads of fancy and feeling.&#xD;

&#xD;
DESIRE TO SEE THE WORLD.         335&#xD;
&#xD;
At length the tide of ages seemed rolled back, the vast con-&#xD;
course of the heavens was lighted up in majestic beauty, and he&#xD;
felt surrounded with the sublime spirits of all times. These&#xD;
diffused around him the inspiring glow of their presence, and the&#xD;
young man became spell-bound to the genius of literature and&#xD;
science. He could not leave the library; he might be found&#xD;
there at any time, morning, noon and evening; and often past&#xD;
midnight, the glimmering light through the shutter might have&#xD;
revealed to the passer the presence of the young man in his&#xD;
wedded haunt. At last, his health began to fail; it was per-&#xD;
ceptible in his waning eye, in his pallid cheek and distracted&#xD;
air.&#xD;
Mrs. Radesky noticed this, and suggested a remedy. She&#xD;
proposed that Walter supervise the studies of Adelgitha, while&#xD;
she would teach the young man two of the modern languages&#xD;
of Europe, with which she was best acquainted -namely&#xD;
French and German.&#xD;
Walter at first received this proposition with intense reluc.&#xD;
tance. It cost him a struggle to resolve to tear himself away&#xD;
from the fascinating library; but when he reflected that an&#xD;
acquaintance with the languages themselves would enable him&#xD;
to appreciate those authors of genius, whose spiritual beauty&#xD;
cannot be transfused through a translation, he began to feel a&#xD;
willingness for the change.&#xD;
The time given with Adelgitha was a sweet and pleasant&#xD;
pastime. She learned almost by intuition. He merely aided&#xD;
her in getting at the mysteries of the :lesson; and oftentimes&#xD;
she would outstrip him in sagacity and rapidity of perception,&#xD;
Then she was so ingenious, so teachable, so grateful for aid, so&#xD;
earnest in quest of truth, that the pains he bestowed was a&#xD;
pleasure that compensated all labor.&#xD;
The mode which Mrs. Radesky adoptod to teach a modern&#xD;
language, was as novel as it was ingenious and successful.&#xD;
&#xD;
She began by presenting some visible object; and then con-&#xD;
nected with it the sound that represented the thing. After&#xD;
making sure of the sound, this was analyzed, and each element&#xD;
made familiar to the several organs addressed in learning the&#xD;
language, by repeated practice. After getting familiar a stock&#xD;
of words, the representation of visible, tangible objects, she&#xD;
commenced with thoughts or, ideas, and pursued an analogous&#xD;
course. In this way, Walter found, in a short time, that he&#xD;
could not only speak and write the language he was learning,&#xD;
and understand it when spoken by others, but he saw himself&#xD;
enabled to read the classical authors with considerable ease,&#xD;
and with a perception of their latent beauty, which he had&#xD;
never before been conscious of.&#xD;
In this way twelve months flew by most delightfully with&#xD;
Walter. Yet he began to feel impatient for change ; not that&#xD;
he experienced any lassitude or weariness of feeling in his&#xD;
present delightful intercourse, but because a new desire, or&#xD;
rather an old one, brightened up in his breast. Among the&#xD;
books that lie had been reading, were entertaining travels.&#xD;
They had awakened within him increased enthusiasm to see&#xD;
the world, to get information at first hand, to quaff at the&#xD;
fountain of the stream, to know man as he is, to commune with&#xD;
majestic nature ; in fine, to rise to the full stature of manhood.&#xD;
Walter communicated his ,new project to the family at the&#xD;
tea-table. Little Adelgitha heard it with tearful silence, but&#xD;
her infantile bosom swelled visibly with emotions of regret.&#xD;
Mrs. Radesky was charmed with the romance of the enter-&#xD;
prise, but she expressed unfeigned sorrow at the thought of&#xD;
losing the society of Mr. Carl, and of being deprived of the&#xD;
opportunity of giving further proof of their gratitude for the&#xD;
inestimable favor he had done them. Her attachment to&#xD;
Walter was sincere. The young man's frank and genial nature&#xD;
had won greatly upon her womanly susceptibilities, and it cost&#xD;

&#xD;
her a deep inward struggle to reconcile herself to the thought&#xD;
of parting with him, perhaps never to meet again. Count&#xD;
Radesky was too much a man of the world, not to perceive&#xD;
that it would be vain to think of retaining the young man for&#xD;
any length of time in his family. Therefore, he entered into&#xD;
Walter's projects for the journey with warm interest. He&#xD;
possessed, himself, an enthusiasm for travelling ; and his ex-&#xD;
tensive information enabled him to be of essential aid in advis-&#xD;
ing Walter upon his projected plans. A fine sense of deli-.&#xD;
cacy hindered the Count showing too much regret at losing the&#xD;
young man's society, while his whole treatment of Walter had&#xD;
been such as to assure how cordial had been the happiness of&#xD;
entertaining him, and how hard must be the sorrow of having&#xD;
him leave.&#xD;
We will not attempt to describe the parting scene. Walter&#xD;
took his leave ,on horseback, well provided with the means of&#xD;
an extensive tour in the United States. It was only after a&#xD;
few days that he felt in its full force the loneliness of his feel-&#xD;
ings, and how much he had lost in leaving a family endeared&#xD;
to him with all the ties of affection and kindness.&#xD;

SIAKsPEARE'S JULIUs C ESAR.&#xD;
WALTER awoke from a deep slumber by a noise as of shuf-&#xD;
ling of feet over his head, and a rustling sound, as of persons&#xD;
in violent struggle for mastery. This was followed by a sup-&#xD;
pressed shriek and a heavy, deadened plunge, as of a log&#xD;
thrown into the sea. He was greatly startled ; and half rising&#xD;
in his berth, he listened with dread foi further revelations.&#xD;
Nothing more coining to his excited ear, he threw on hastily&#xD;
his clothes, and rushed upon deck ; but the splendid ship that&#xD;
was bearing him majestically over the bosom of the vast ocean,&#xD;
was holding her wonted way amid the solemn beauty of night,&#xD;
and everything upon deck was -regular and quiet. Conclud-&#xD;
ing that he must have been mistaken in his apprehensions, he&#xD;
retired again to his berth, and soon fell asleep.&#xD;
But at the change of watch in the morning, the startling&#xD;
intelligence came to light that the chief mate was missing.&#xD;
The alarm circulated like a flash of lightning throughout the&#xD;
ship, and the greatest consternation prevailed on board. All&#xD;
sorts of conjectures were Inade as to the cause of his mysteri-&#xD;
ous disappearance, but the sailors with great unanimity per-&#xD;
sisted in the belief that he must have slipped overboard&#xD;
accidentally in his watch, and they mentioned one and&#xD;
another circumstance to corroborate their opinions.&#xD;

838                THE FISHER BOY.&#xD;
Days elapsed, and no clue had been gained as to the fate&#xD;
of the missing man. So sudden a loss was wE1 'alculated to&#xD;
send a shock to every bosom, and the vacancy of so important&#xD;
trust as that of first officer, was severely felt. Yet the captain&#xD;
promptly assumed the duties of the departed mate, and the&#xD;
discipline and routine of the ship's duties went on, without&#xD;
apparent interruption.&#xD;
But Walter could not reconcile to himself the mystery of&#xD;
the affair. He gradually came to the belief that there must&#xD;
have been foul play connected with the loss of the mate. The&#xD;
noise that startled him on the evening already mentioned, was&#xD;
capable of such a construction. And he now brought to mind&#xD;
other incidents and remarks which at the time passed for&#xD;
nothing in his mind, but now, in connection with the great&#xD;
event, had a palpable meaning in their bearing. Then the&#xD;
crew were unusually silent, secretive, were frequently together&#xD;
in private consultation, and bore all the time in their counte-&#xD;
nances a sinister expression, as if some dreadful deed hung over&#xD;
their souls. At last, Walter could not resist the firm convic-&#xD;
tion that a dreadful conspiracy had been concocted by the&#xD;
crew, and that the disappearance of the mate was the first&#xD;
scene in the awful tragedy.&#xD;
He fancied, as he watched narrowly everything around him,&#xD;
that the after guard had an impression similar to his own.&#xD;
The captain looked concerned, and never ventured forward of&#xD;
midship. The wife of the captain, a beautiful young woman,&#xD;
who was making her bridal tour with the noble man of her&#xD;
choice, seemed pale and apprehensive, whenever she appeared&#xD;
upon deck. The other people aft, in one way or another,&#xD;
showed a disturbed mind.&#xD;
Walter wished much to communicate his suspicions to the&#xD;
captain, or, at least, to some one of the cabin people; but the&#xD;
etiquette of ship life, and other circumstances, gave him no&#xD;
&#xD;
A MUTINY.&#xD;
&#xD;
339&#xD;
&#xD;
opportunity. But he thought well upon the posture of things&#xD;
around him, took his part with deliberation, and prepared his&#xD;
mind for any emergency.&#xD;
Matters went on in this way, until late one night when the&#xD;
wind was blowing briskly, he was alarmed by a sudden noise&#xD;
in a distant part of the ship. He was prepared, and sprang&#xD;
with a single leap out of the gangway, which he closed and&#xD;
bolted as he passed through. As he reached the midships of&#xD;
the ship, the appalling spectacle struck his excited gaze, of the&#xD;
captain struggling with deathless energy in the grasp of two&#xD;
brawny sailors, who, after much effort, succeeded in throwing&#xD;
him into the sea. The sympathy and indignation of his&#xD;
nature was aroused to the highest pitch. Springing to the&#xD;
cabin gangway, he met there the second mate, steward and&#xD;
stewardess, preceded by the wife of the captain, all full armed.&#xD;
Walter seized the pistol from the trembling hand of the latter,&#xD;
and fired upon the- foremost of the, gang, who were approach-&#xD;
ing with apparently murderous intent. He fell disabled, but&#xD;
not dead. The sailor takes fright at the sight of fire-arms.&#xD;
The remainder of the sailors perceiving with what they had&#xD;
to contend, retreated hastily forward, intending there,it is pre-&#xD;
sumed, to be joined by the watch below, and all to make a&#xD;
determined stand. But finding the watch below secured there&#xD;
by the precaution of Walter, and themselves pushed to the&#xD;
last extremity by the heroism and activity of -their pursuers,&#xD;
they surrendered, asking for quarter. All were secured by&#xD;
the second mate, and placed firmly in irons. The watch&#xD;
were imprisoned with more difficulty.&#xD;
On investigation, it came to light, as Walter had suspected,&#xD;
that a bloody conspiracy had been hatched by the remorseless&#xD;
crew. Their plan was to make way with all the after-guard,&#xD;
except the wife of the captain, whom they would retain.&#xD;
Walter was to be saved under strict surveillance, as their&#xD;

&#xD;
navigator, until they reached their destination, when he, too,&#xD;
was to be sacrificed, upon the maxim of security that "dead&#xD;
men tell no tales."&#xD;
With deep feelings of gratitude, for what seemed an almost&#xD;
miraculous deliverance, they were yet in a plight that can be&#xD;
better imagined than described. They were hundreds of&#xD;
miles from any land. The mulatto steward and stewardess&#xD;
could not be much depended upon beyond their own sphere.&#xD;
Indeed, they knew actually nothing of the ordinary duties of&#xD;
working ship. The wife, flooded with distress for the loss of&#xD;
her husband, was little less than deranged, in view of her&#xD;
bereavement. The only two, then, able in any degree to cope&#xD;
with the difficulties of their situation, were the second mate&#xD;
and Walter. But the former was a host in himself. Of great&#xD;
physical force, a; thorough seaman, brave, cool, and sagacious,&#xD;
he united the resources of many inferior men. But he knew&#xD;
nothing of navigation, and that essential duty fell upon&#xD;
Walter.&#xD;
Releasing two or three of the most trustful of the fettered&#xD;
mutineers, on promise of f'aithfulnes to duty, they were&#xD;
enabled, by keeping the ship under short sail, to do pretty&#xD;
well. But the duties proved too severe for now Captain Carl.&#xD;
He fell sick of brain fever, and for some time, his life hung upon&#xD;
a trembling balance. In this dreadful crisis the young widow&#xD;
performed a part, that while it showed to what sublime height&#xD;
of heroism the soul may rise, added a gem to the full crown&#xD;
of the virtues of noble woman. She assumed the place of&#xD;
nurse and physician to Walter, and no affectionate sister at&#xD;
the best home, could have been, more kind or devoted. In&#xD;
addition, she stood a watch, relieving the mate at times from&#xD;
his post on deck, kept the reckoning of the ship, which she&#xD;
had learned from her husband, and encouraged and sustained&#xD;
&#xD;
A COLLISION AT SEA.&#xD;

&#xD;
the drooping spirits of all, by her cheerful and bland expres-&#xD;
sions.&#xD;
One dark, stormy night, the wind blowing heavily, Walter&#xD;
was aroused from a drowsy slumber, by an awful shock and&#xD;
crash that fell upon his startled nerves like a clap of thunder.&#xD;
Although still very weak, excitement filled him with energy,&#xD;
and he gained the deck in a moment. A huge ship had just&#xD;
become disengaged from the violent collision which had just&#xD;
happened between it and his own ship, and the other, now like&#xD;
a dark cloud, was disappearing to the leeward. No one on&#xD;
board answered to his repeated call of distress, and it was&#xD;
plain that his ship was going inevitably to the bottom of the&#xD;
ocean, her decks being already on a level with the water. In&#xD;
so awful a crisis, there was but one alternative, and the merest&#xD;
instinct suggested the desperate part that he must take.&#xD;
Launching an empty hencoop, which, with much difficulty he&#xD;
disengaged from the place where it was lashed ; he hurriedly&#xD;
jumped astride of it, and made all possible haste to push a&#xD;
little distance away, lest he should be swallowed up in the&#xD;
vortex that would be caused by the sinking vessel.&#xD;
Daylight revealed to him in burning colors, his wretched&#xD;
condition. His own ship had sunk to rise no more. No&#xD;
other vessel upon the wide watery waste could be descried,&#xD;
to gladden his straining vision. The storm had slightly&#xD;
abated, but the sky still yawned, in lurid hate, and the&#xD;
ocean around dashed in angry surges. There he clung with&#xD;
difficulty to the vestige of plank that barely separated him&#xD;
from dread eternity; weak in body, crushed in spirits, with no&#xD;
rescuing arm above, and with but the fathomless caves, filled&#xD;
with devouring sea-monsters below him. How awful, how&#xD;
appalling the moment ! Death, relentless death, already&#xD;
stared him face to face, and soon, very soon, he must answer&#xD;
the dreadful summons, and be hurried to that bourne whence&#xD;

&#xD;
no traveller returns. As he sat alone upon the world of&#xD;
waters, he had time for bitter reflection. What a vicissitude of&#xD;
fate had not been his. The past arose in distinct, vivid out-&#xD;
line, the future was shadowed in vague, fearful imaginings.&#xD;
How insignificant now appeared to him life, and all its vain&#xD;
objects of sense; how momentous arose to his vision the&#xD;
sacred interests of eternity! Thus day and night passed,&#xD;
bringing no human rescue. The cravings of hunger at length&#xD;
stole upon him, and the parchings of tlrst broke out upon&#xD;
his vitals. An excruciating fever set into his veins, and deli-&#xD;
rium seized his brain. Amid the phantoms of his excited&#xD;
fancy, groaning tables tantalized his longing taste, and'running&#xD;
streams lured him treacherously to their bosom.&#xD;
The physical vanquished, the spiritual battle commenced.&#xD;
All kinds of visions haunted his burning brain. Now, his&#xD;
dear mother, in deep, affectionate tones called him to her, but&#xD;
as he rushed toward her arms, she vanished from his sight.&#xD;
Now, the sweet face of Angeline pressed close to his, as if she&#xD;
would rest her fair head upon his bosom; but as he would fain&#xD;
clasp her beloved form, she eluded his grasp, and he found&#xD;
himself rigidly holding the sides of his coop. Then.he was&#xD;
transported to the delightful family ofthe Count Radesky, at&#xD;
one time toying with the silken curls of the beautiful Adel-&#xD;
githa, at another, listening to the spiritual tones of Madame&#xD;
Radesky, but the next moment he would awake from his&#xD;
trance, and find the pitiless elements but mocking his delu-&#xD;
sions.&#xD;
One night he was continually visited by an apparition that&#xD;
resembled the strange being that had hung around his path-&#xD;
way so mysteriously. She kept his company like some per-&#xD;
sistent death watcher. Whenever he closed his eyes, there&#xD;
would be the same deep, suffering face, earnest, entreating,&#xD;
pleading look, with hair dishevelled, and eye wandering with&#xD;
frenzy.&#xD;
&#xD;
At length, feeling conscious of departing energies, he care-&#xD;
fully lashed himself to his little bark of refuge by a rope that&#xD;
had remained attached to it by chance, and resigned himself&#xD;
to the future of his fate.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
" Human life is checkered at the best,&#xD;
And joy and grief alternately preside,&#xD;
The good and evil demon of mankind.&#xD;
TRACY'S PERIANDER."&#xD;
WHEN Walter awoke to consciousness, he found himself in&#xD;
a comfortable room, with an amiable attendant at his side,&#xD;
administering to his every need. He was at first too weak to&#xD;
speak, but on gaining force he eagerly inquired where he was,&#xD;
and how he cane there. He was told that he was on board&#xD;
a ship coming from South America, and bound to Antwerp, in&#xD;
Europe.   That one day, the look-out descried something&#xD;
upon the water, very distant to the leeward, whereupon the&#xD;
captain, who made it a rule to pass nothing upon the sea with-&#xD;
out actually determining what it is, had a boat despatched,&#xD;
which returned with Walter, apparently dead ; but by assiduous&#xD;
care, and the devotion of a skilful physician on board, he had&#xD;
been restored to life. Walter felt a glow of gratitude at this&#xD;
rehearsal. "After all," ejaculated he to himself, "how humane&#xD;
and noble is the human heart!"&#xD;
Days passed, and he continued to gather in strength. One&#xD;
day, on descrying land upon the Old World, it being very&#xD;
pleasant weather, Walter was taken upon deck for the first&#xD;
time, to participate in the general joy. As he was about&#xD;
being again removed below, a lady from among the passengers.&#xD;
passed him, and their eyes met. He felt sure of having seen&#xD;
the face before, but where, he could not tell. The lady seemed&#xD;
affected by the same embarrassment; but after a moment's&#xD;
hesitation, she passed on, and descended to the cabin.&#xD;
Walter not feeling so well from the exertion of being taken&#xD;
(344)&#xD;
&#xD;
to the deck, he did not again leave his room until the ship&#xD;
arrived at Antwerp. Here he was taken to the home of the&#xD;
American Consul at that port, where he received every kind-&#xD;
ness the most exacting nature could desire.&#xD;
It would be impossible to describe his emotions upon step-&#xD;
ping foot upon the Old World; and as he sauntered through&#xD;
the quaint old city, with its many thrilling mementoes of a&#xD;
former time, his feelings, were excited to the verge of enthu-&#xD;
siasm. One day, standing in company with Miss Belmont,&#xD;
the daughter of the American Consul, in the Square, admir-&#xD;
ing the noble pile of the Antwerp Cathedral, a carriage drove&#xD;
slowly past them, and stopped. The footman descended,&#xD;
approached Walter, and deferentially begged the favor of his&#xD;
address. It was granted. Turning toward the carriage, the&#xD;
middle piece of which was down, he perceived that one of the&#xD;
inmates was a lady, and he recognized her as the one whom&#xD;
he met on board the ship. The lady returned somewhat&#xD;
warmly his salutation, and the carriage rolled on.&#xD;
The next day, a gentleman elegantly attired rang the bell&#xD;
of his room, and politely handed Walter a package. On open-&#xD;
ing the unexpected parcel, he was most agreeably surprised to&#xD;
find therein a beautiful picture very richly set, which he had&#xD;
no difficulty in recognizing as. a miniature portrait of the lady&#xD;
whom he met the day before upon the Square in front of the&#xD;
grand Antwerp Cathedral. There was, besides, a handsome&#xD;
sum of'money in the package, in gold, and a bill of exchange&#xD;
for a much larger amount upon a well known Banking House&#xD;
in London. Accompanying these treasures, was a gracefully&#xD;
turned and modest letter, expressive of unfeigned gratitude&#xD;
toward Walter, for having once so nobly risked his own life to&#xD;
save hers ; a regret that circumstances did not permit her to&#xD;
ask the privilege of seeing him in person, and begging if she&#xD;
might be permitted to ask his acceptance of the accompanying&#xD;

gifts as a slight token of her heartfelt esteem, until she should&#xD;
have it in her power to make some more befitting return.&#xD;
She added in a postscript, that she was to leave the city that&#xD;
very hour.&#xD;
For a moment Walter remained in a state of amazement&#xD;
at this new turn in the web of his fate ; but presently the&#xD;
truth gleamed upon his mind. She must be the identical lady&#xD;
whom he rescued from the boiling surf, at the Point of Cape&#xD;
Malabar, and the very same whose face struck him so cog-&#xD;
nizable once on board the ship that bore them in company to&#xD;
Europe. But why did she not see him and make herself&#xD;
known at once.   Another mystery.   How romantic it all&#xD;
seemed ! Would marvels never cease in his checkered life?&#xD;
But he had become too used to strange, vicissitudes to be long&#xD;
excited.  He laid by the gifts with emotions of tranquil&#xD;
delight, trustful that the future would reveal all to light.&#xD;
Previously to the incident just narrated, Walter had com-&#xD;
pleted his arrangements to make a partial tour through&#xD;
Europe. Having at his disposal but very limited pecuniary&#xD;
means, he had expected to be under the necessity of making&#xD;
his journey on foot, and living by the way in the most scanty&#xD;
manner possible. But so intense was his desire to visit the&#xD;
spots and feast his greedy eyes upon the scenes that were so&#xD;
endeared to his memory and fancy, that going a-foot he did not&#xD;
account a very great hardship. Indeed, he would have&#xD;
crawled upon his hands and knees, he thought, had there been&#xD;
left no other way to accomplish his'wishes. It was not the&#xD;
delectable care and genial comfort of 'travelling that he sought,&#xD;
but to administer to the cravings of a spirit of truthfulness for&#xD;
nature, and to gratify a chivalrous love for those glowing asso-,&#xD;
ciations enkindled by reading and study. Then, what treas-&#xD;
ures of nature, what beauties of art, what glorious associations'&#xD;
of history was he not soon to possess !, All the hardships he&#xD;
&#xD;
TRAVELLING ON HORSEBACK.       347&#xD;
&#xD;
had undergone, all the sufferings he had experienced were as&#xD;
nothing by the side of the well-filled cup of happiness that he&#xD;
was soon to quaff to his fill. Indeed, his trials only prepared&#xD;
his mind for a keener relish of what was in store for him.&#xD;
In this delightful mood, with the full means at his command&#xD;
to choose his mode of travelling, he set off, after taking a&#xD;
grateful leave of the family of the Consul, and the many&#xD;
friends he had made, during his short stay in this interesting&#xD;
old city of Flanders. While we will leave the young man to&#xD;
enjoy unmolested the pleasures of his route, we will turn to&#xD;
other scenes in the thread of our story.&#xD;
Walter, after leaving the charming family of Count Radesky,&#xD;
spent full two years in travelling in his native country. This&#xD;
journey was made for the most part on horseback, that very&#xD;
exhilarating and mind-tonic mode of travelling. This was at&#xD;
a period when public conveyances were less- numerous than at&#xD;
the present time, and in the course of his tour, he met with&#xD;
much hardship, and not a few adventures; these seemed,&#xD;
however, but to impart robustness of limb, and vigor of mind.&#xD;
He visited in the course of his journey, almost every place of&#xD;
note or of interest that he could possibly discover from Maine&#xD;
to Texas, and from the Atlantic to the Rocky Mountains.&#xD;
He thus drank deep at the fount of Nature in the grandeur&#xD;
of our country, and had his perception enlarged of the ex-&#xD;
haustless wonders in our glorious and broad domain.  It&#xD;
served, too, as an excellent preparation for profitably travel-&#xD;
ling abroad, and enabled him to form the acquaintance of&#xD;
distinguished intelligent men in Europe, upon the broad prin-&#xD;
ciple of mutual advantage, for the truthful and reliable infor-&#xD;
mation he could impart of his own country.&#xD;
But he began to be weary of journeying at home, and the&#xD;
time ripened for him to transfer his interest to the other con-&#xD;
tinent. The Count Radesky, in his unbounded generosity, had&#xD;

&#xD;
furnished him ample means to complete his tour upon both&#xD;
continents, and gave him besides letters of credit upon his&#xD;
banker in Philadelphia. But what with sending at times&#xD;
small sums to his beloved mother, and of relieving frequent&#xD;
cases;of distress that he -met with on his way, he found him-&#xD;
self at the end of the two years almost quite destitute of&#xD;
funds. His sense of justice would not allow him to tax fur-&#xD;
ther the generosity of the Count Radesky, and impressed with&#xD;
the belief that a humble mode of travelling possessed many&#xD;
advantages in enabling the traveller to see life from an intel-&#xD;
ligent stand point, he shipped in a large bark lying at Phila-&#xD;
delphia, bound to India, by the way of the Sandwich Islands.&#xD;
The passage out was all that could be wished. The captain's&#xD;
youthful bride imparted lustre to the sentiment of ship life.&#xD;
There were, besides, several missionaries, male and female,&#xD;
those sublime spirits in the cause of religious devotion. The&#xD;
weather was fine, balmy and golden. Many diversions of a&#xD;
healthful and elevating kind were devised, in which the sailors&#xD;
.often were invited to participate. And Walter thought he&#xD;
had hardly ever enjoyed himself much more pleasantly.&#xD;
But on their return, the sad scenes occurred which we have&#xD;
briefly described, and which gave so sudden a turn to the&#xD;
course of Walter's life.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
"Death is the privilege of human nature ;&#xD;
And life without it were not worth our taking.&#xD;
Thither the poor, the pris'ner, and the mourner&#xD;
Fly for relief, and lay their burdens down."&#xD;
RowE's FAIR PENITENT.&#xD;
A DEEP cloud of gloom hung over the paternal mansion.&#xD;
A noble spirit had passed from earth. Mrs. Carl had left this&#xD;
suffering vale of life, to find a mansion where sorrows are no&#xD;
more.-&#xD;
The bereaved woman had struggled along in her daily path,&#xD;
with a tranquil brow, while cheered with the solace of her&#xD;
son's remembrance, and the hope of his final return; but when&#xD;
the dreadful intelligence came of his shipwreck and probable&#xD;
loss, her strong spirit gave way, and she continued waning&#xD;
until merciful death clasped her to himself. Her last moments&#xD;
were peaceful, like those of a grand soul, and she sank gently&#xD;
into eternity like the quiet setting of departing day.&#xD;
In the same upper chamber where we first met her with&#xD;
Walter, lies now stretched her pallid corse, with a face still&#xD;
serene in the calm repose of death. The room is partially&#xD;
darkened, here and there hang the emblems of mourning, and&#xD;
the few who enter tread softly, as if their feathery steps could&#xD;
disturb that spirit now hushed forever, which had wrestled so&#xD;
bravely with the storms of life.&#xD;
The funeral day arrives. It is a sweet autumnal afternoon,&#xD;
and the very anniversary of Walter's departure from home.&#xD;
The fallen leaf from the -withered foliage, and the crimson&#xD;
glories of the forest, seem in touching consonance with the sol-&#xD;

&#xD;
emn scene. A holy, pensive calm pervades nature without,&#xD;
as if heaven had lain the hush of her hand upon earth in&#xD;
sympathy with the quiet entrance of a prized soul to her joy-&#xD;
ful abodes.&#xD;
Relatives, friends and neighbors fill the stricken mansion,&#xD;
as - if moved with a common sentiment_ of condolence, and&#xD;
many stand without in the attitude of- mournful grief. The&#xD;
services are fervent, impressive. All hearts are touched, but&#xD;
there is no need of gifted words to awaken latent sympathies.&#xD;
There are lives more eloquent than human tongues, lives so&#xD;
embalmed in the common heart, that the tiniest finger laid&#xD;
upon their full stringed soul-harp, touches a chord that thrills&#xD;
with keenestvibration through every fraternal bosom.&#xD;
The services over, the long procession moved with solemn&#xD;
march to the grave-side. There the irrepressive sobs attest&#xD;
the depth of the common grief. The unrelenting earth closes&#xD;
over her who in life had no foe, in death will be long remem-&#xD;
bered, yet in whose pathway trial and suffering ever lay in thick-&#xD;
est gloom. How unequal seem the fortunes of life ! The last&#xD;
sod is laid upon the round grave, and the remaining company&#xD;
sadly retire. - No, there ,is one that lingers long behind. She&#xD;
remains fixed to the spot, as if rooted there by a sentiment&#xD;
beyond her power to control. She is a comely maiden, ex-&#xD;
quisitely attired in deep black, with a face of classical beauty&#xD;
of form, and of great depth of expression. Who may she be?&#xD;
"It was a most affecting occasion, that we have witnessed&#xD;
this afternoon," observed sadly Miss Angeline Readcliff to Mr.&#xD;
Charles Raymond, two of the 'company who were wending&#xD;
their way homeward from the funeral just described.&#xD;
" It was, indeed," replied the other. " What a pity that her&#xD;
son should have caused her so much grief."&#xD;
" To what doyou now refer, Mr. Raymond? " asked -An-&#xD;
geline with an earnest look of inquiry.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Why, they say," replied Charles, "that her son, upon&#xD;
whom she doted very fondly, has fallen into bad ways, and the&#xD;
news of it broke her heart."&#xD;
"No, you mistake," interrupted Angeline, with energy.-&#xD;
"It was the intelligence of his death, that caused her last&#xD;
illness."&#xD;
" Ah, yes," replied Charles, "that may have had something&#xD;
to do with it, too, but it was the report of his becoming dissi-&#xD;
pated that gave the fatal stab."&#xD;
" Who says so," demanded Angeline, with evident feeling.&#xD;
" Who dares thus stab the peace of an honorable family -ruin&#xD;
a fair name? I will not believe it."&#xD;
"Perhaps you are a little partial," remarked Charles, in a&#xD;
caressing voice ; "If I remember rightly, you were once very&#xD;
intimate friends."&#xD;
"Yes, Mr. Raymond," answered Angeline with spirit,&#xD;
"Walter Carl and myself were once friends, lovers, if you&#xD;
please. It was a pure youthful sentiment, nothing more. My&#xD;
friends opposed the continuance of his addresses. I yielded at&#xD;
once to their better judgments. He submitted with manly&#xD;
grace, and we parted. We are nothing to each other further,&#xD;
but from common justice I will not tamely submit to see him&#xD;
vilely slandered. His character is as incorruptible as truth&#xD;
itself. I beg, Mr. Raymond, that you will not ever again pain&#xD;
me with so base an allusion."&#xD;
Charles felt stung with remorse for having wounded the&#xD;
feelings of the girl of all others the dearest to his heart.&#xD;
" Pardon me," he said, " I did not wish to be unjust, I was&#xD;
but repeating what I had heard, which I confess is a very&#xD;
unsafe rule."&#xD;
" But who was that young lady dressed in black, so attentive&#xD;
to the family ?" he asked, very willing to turn the subject.&#xD;
"That is Miss Isadore Leeland," answered mildly Angeline,&#xD;

a little repentant for having betrayed so much feeling. " She&#xD;
has been very attentive during the entire illness of Mrs. Carl.&#xD;
No daughter could have been more kind, affectionate, and de-&#xD;
voted.&#xD;
Her family became reduced from affluence to extreme pov-&#xD;
erty. I think there was some difficulty between the parents.&#xD;
At any rate there was much distress at home, and Isadore&#xD;
led a vagabondish life away from the maternal roof. In one of&#xD;
her nocturnal rambles she met with, it is said, a lady who had&#xD;
been shipwrecked upon our coast. Strange to say, an intimacy&#xD;
grew up between them, which has lasted since. The lady&#xD;
was a foreigner and is very rich. Since her father and mother&#xD;
have died, Isadore remains at home, educates the children,&#xD;
and under the auspices of her patron the family have greatly&#xD;
prospered."&#xD;
" Ah ! how romantic a circumstance," observed Charles.--&#xD;
At this moment they arrived at the house of Mr. Readcliff,&#xD;
and bidding Angeline good afternoon, he took his leave, and&#xD;
turned homeward.S&#xD;

As if with soul and passion thrilled."&#xD;
MOoRE.&#xD;
&#xD;
WALTER was pursuing his European Tour with delightful&#xD;
ardor. He had visited many of the principal cities and places&#xD;
of noted interest in Germany, that fatherland of the Teutonic&#xD;
heart ; had spent a dazzling month in Paris, that splendid&#xD;
world in miniature ; sojourned awhile with feelings of gushing&#xD;
freshness amid the beautiful lakes and picturesque scenes of&#xD;
Switzerland ; had crossed with glowing heart the royal Alps,&#xD;
and was now luxuriating in sunny Italy, that immortal land&#xD;
of genius.&#xD;
At every step in his route, his enthusiasm was excited and&#xD;
refreshed, either by some spot of intense historical interest,&#xD;
some noble work of art, bearing testimony to the sublime&#xD;
genius of man ; or by some grand or charming scene in nature.&#xD;
The costume, manners, political and social institutions, and&#xD;
individual traits of character, were to him  matters of lively&#xD;
interest.&#xD;
Indeed, his whole course was a perpetual ovation, in which&#xD;
every object in his pathway contributed to his joy. He felt&#xD;
continually his soul to enlarge, his mental vision to expand, his&#xD;
heart to ennoble. Broader views of life, higher aims of&#xD;
achievement, more generous principles of action swelled his&#xD;
heart. Local prej idices, narrow feelings, illiberal tenets,&#xD;
melted gradually from his breast, like mist before the rising&#xD;
sun. His happines was constant and serene, and was of that&#xD;

A MAGNIFICENT SCENE.         355&#xD;
&#xD;
exalted kind that leaves the soul in a strong, healthful and re-&#xD;
freshed state.&#xD;
He was made fully aware of what great advantage was his&#xD;
knowledge of French and German, by enabling him to circu-&#xD;
late freely with all classes, and to appreciate their peculiar&#xD;
character and mode of thought. He perceived that he who&#xD;
travels without an acquaintance with the language of the na-&#xD;
tions he proposes to learn about, or of some language which&#xD;
will afford him a medium of communication, labors to great&#xD;
disadvantage.&#xD;
Walter was tarrying now a season at Naples, both to enjoy&#xD;
its noble bay, and to improve, under a master, his acquaintance&#xD;
with Italian, which he had begun to study with deep interest.&#xD;
As arelaxation from severe application, he had the habit, af-&#xD;
ternoons, of taking a stroll amid the environs of the city, and.&#xD;
yield to the musings of his mind.&#xD;
One beautiful afternoon, as he was passing a magnificent&#xD;
country seat, he applied for permission to see its attractive&#xD;
garden. The porter retired respectfully with his application,&#xD;
and in a few moments returning, opened his gates and gra-&#xD;
ciously welcomed him within the charming precints. He was&#xD;
here presented to a liveried servant, who with obsequious deli-&#xD;
cacy showed him minutely over the fascinating grounds, pro-&#xD;
fusely enriched with the beauties of nature and art.- He was&#xD;
thence invited into the superb chateau itself, where a lady ap-&#xD;
proached him on his entrance, and politely offered to conduct,&#xD;
him through the apartments of the statel edifice. Her in-,&#xD;
telligent appearance and dignified bearing impressed Walter&#xD;
favorably, and he thankfully accepted. He thereupon followed.&#xD;
his accommodating guide, and was well repaid for the time&#xD;
spent. As. he went froni room to room, surprise followed&#xD;
upon surprise.. Here it was the curious architecture that&#xD;
seized his attention ; there the quaint decoration that attracted&#xD;
&#xD;
his observation. At this point the ~costly furnishing that he&#xD;
must stop to admire ; at that, some work of art, or relic of an-&#xD;
tiquity, that he gazed upon with deep emotion - a picture by&#xD;
some grand old master, a piece of sculpture by some immortal&#xD;
genius, or an unwieldy armor worn by some member of the&#xD;
family, in some renowned exploit.&#xD;
At length, having completed the tour of the house, Walter&#xD;
was conducted into a small apartment, in which was a table&#xD;
spread with wine, fruit, and every luxury of the country.&#xD;
Here he was blandly invited to be seated, and partake&#xD;
freely of the refreshments before him. Pointing him to a seat,&#xD;
and taking another opposite to him at the table, while Walter&#xD;
was regaling himself in the pleasures of appetite, the lady&#xD;
gave a succinct account of the noble family through which the&#xD;
lordly mansion had descended for many generations. As&#xD;
Walter motioned to go, the-lady gave him a pressing invita-&#xD;
tion to repeat his visit on the following evening, when he might&#xD;
be pleased to see the establishment under more flattering cir-&#xD;
cumstances.&#xD;
Punctually at the hour appointed, Walter, under'an irresist-&#xD;
ible feeling of curiosity, presented, himself at the gate of the&#xD;
lordly residence he had visited the day before. As he&#xD;
approached, the gate flew open, and presented the garden and&#xD;
house under the magical effect of a grand illumination. The&#xD;
fountains were playing'; and as the pearly jets gleamed in the&#xD;
streaming light, giving an illusory animation to the statuary&#xD;
just visible through the trembling foliage, he was moved with&#xD;
feelings of novel delight. As he advanced toward the house,&#xD;
soft strains of sweet, melodious music, came floating upon the&#xD;
impregnated air ; and as he entered, hall after hall, richly fes-&#xD;
tooned, and brilliantly lighted, charmed his sight. Indeed the&#xD;
whole scene appeared one of enchantment.&#xD;
He was presently conducted into a magnificent apartment,&#xD;

A PLEASANT SURPRISE.          357&#xD;
&#xD;
856              THE FISlER BOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
in which the art of man seemed to have surpassed itself. All&#xD;
his dreams of oriental splendor were here realized. The&#xD;
architectural beauty, the richness, the splendor, the gorgeous-&#xD;
ness, disposed with the most consummate taste, made the young&#xD;
man fairly reel with bewidered delight. Upon a rich ottoman&#xD;
was reclining the most beautiful female that Walter thought&#xD;
lhe had ever seen. She was strictly of the' Italian type of&#xD;
beauty, and it seemed that Nature and Art had vied in per-&#xD;
fecting the most lovely gem of woman. Attired richly, but in&#xD;
the most exquisite taste, there was in her manner a certain&#xD;
languishing grace, that threw over her person a species of&#xD;
fasemnation not easily described.&#xD;
She arose and greeted Walter with a matchless ease of&#xD;
breeding, that is "the most rare and difficult attainment. Seat-&#xD;
ing herself by his side, she commenced a graceful and sus-&#xD;
tained conversation upon the attractions of Italy to the&#xD;
stranger. She spoke in the purest English, except that there&#xD;
was a slight foreign accent, that but heightened, however, the&#xD;
charm of her intonation.&#xD;
But a few moments had elapsed of this delightful tete-a-tete,&#xD;
when a low rumbling sound was heard, at the first vibration&#xD;
of which, the lady bent forward and listened with anxious&#xD;
suspense.&#xD;
At the repetition of the sound, she darted out of ,the room&#xD;
with alarm depicted upon her countenance. As Walter cast&#xD;
his eyes upon the garden, which was visible from the windows&#xD;
of the room, of a sudden the jetty darkness of midnight suc-&#xD;
ceeded' the most brilliant illumination.  Presently a man&#xD;
rushed into the room with a face laggard with anxiety, and&#xD;
seizing Walter by the arm, thrust him without explanation or&#xD;
ceremony into a closet, the door of which seemed to close&#xD;
by a spring. At once he felt himself descending down, down,&#xD;
whither he knew not; but the sensation of dismay that seized&#xD;
&#xD;
him sent his heart throbbing to his throat. But landing&#xD;
speedily upon a stone floor, the door of his caged box sprang&#xD;
open and revealed nought but a world of darkness around&#xD;
him. In a moment, however, he perceived an aperture of&#xD;
light, through which he barely squeezed, and scrambling along&#xD;
an embankment and through a hedge, succeeded finally in&#xD;
reaching the highway, glad to be so safely through the mys-&#xD;
terious adventure.&#xD;
The next day as Walter, walking toward thp harbor, revolv-&#xD;
ingin his mind the strange incident of the preceding evening,&#xD;
his, attention was diverted to a boat approaching the shore,&#xD;
that had just set out from a beautiful brig lying a little dis-&#xD;
tance off at anchor. His interest continued to increase, in&#xD;
observing the admirable discipline in the rowing, and the pre-&#xD;
cision with which she glided over the water. As the boat&#xD;
neared the shore, Walter thought the well dressed gentleman&#xD;
steering in the stern he had seen before. And as he jumped&#xD;
upon the landing, Walter, carried away with a flood of emotion,&#xD;
sprarg upon the sailor's neck exclaiming, " and Mr. Marlow,&#xD;
is it you ?"  They stood locked in each other's arms, while&#xD;
the crew stood by in amazement.&#xD;
It was, indeed, no other than Old Marl, who: having come&#xD;
unexpectedly in possession- of property, that was saved from&#xD;
his father's estate, had purchased a fine brig, of which he was&#xD;
in command.   His intelligence and experience had enabled&#xD;
him to take advantage of the shifting currents of commerce,&#xD;
and he had realized a large sum from his last voyage.  He&#xD;
was intending, he said, to retire to America and go to sea no&#xD;
more, having become tired of roaming, and being convinced&#xD;
that a snug home, surrounded with peace and contentment was&#xD;
the nearest condition to happiness to be found here below.&#xD;
"Then you will take to yourself a wife," observed Walter.&#xD;
" Who knows," replied the sailor, shifting his quid of&#xD;

tobacco, "if I can find the fair damsel who gave me a lift,&#xD;
one dreary night."&#xD;
" Ah ! who was it? " asked Walter.&#xD;
"Well, come on board and spend the night with me,,and&#xD;
you shall have the whole story."&#xD;
Walter accepted.' 'Old Marl,' or now Capt. Jameson, re-&#xD;
lated to the young man, circumstantially, all that had trans-&#xD;
pired in his history since they parted. Walter, in his turn,&#xD;
detailed the incidents of his life, keeping nothing back, not&#xD;
even the adventure of the preceding evening. To this latter,&#xD;
Capt. Jameson shook his head, with a knowing smile, and&#xD;
bid the young man beware how he became fascinated with ap-&#xD;
pearances. " But," he remarked, " I have some anecdotes of&#xD;
my own experience, of a similar nature to relate, which I will&#xD;
reserve to beguile the, tedium of our passage home; for we&#xD;
are bound to Boston, and I mean to take you along with me.&#xD;
You have roamed quite long enough. Go home and cheer the&#xD;
declining years of your mother ! Settle down upon some use-&#xD;
ful occupation; and slowly,_ but surely, achieve a character and&#xD;
independence.&#xD;
Walter was but too glad to accept the kind proffer of his&#xD;
friend. In a few weeks they set sail, and after a favorable&#xD;
passage, arrived in Boston. The first man whom Walter met&#xD;
upon the wharf, on landing, was a neighbor of his family,&#xD;
who conveyed the heart-rending intelligence of the death of his&#xD;
beloved mother.&#xD;
He hastened home, but with a heavy heart. All the touch-&#xD;
ing traits and devotion of his mother arose to his memory, and&#xD;
nearly overpowered him with emotion. He upbraided him-&#xD;
self for staying so long from the sunshine of her presence.&#xD;
Before entering the house, he ha#ned to the grave-yard,&#xD;
where he knew she would be buried. Some one had erected&#xD;
a beautiful marble slab over her grave, appropriately inscribed,&#xD;
&#xD;
y V&#xD;
f&#xD;
&#xD;
and surrounded it with willows and flowers. He wept there&#xD;
long, and with the tears of true filial affection. Oh, what&#xD;
would he not give to call back that dear spirit, the mother of&#xD;
his youth. How hard that he could not have been present to&#xD;
smooth her dying pillow.&#xD;
The next day, as he approached his mother's grave-side, he&#xD;
perceived there a female reclining over the slab in an attitude&#xD;
of sorrow. He was struck with her form and countenance.&#xD;
It seemed to him that he had seen the face before. The lady&#xD;
. .  was tall, graceful, and very beautiful. He would at any time&#xD;
have been interested in her appearance, but now all interest&#xD;
concentrated upon the impression she made upon his memory&#xD;
of the past.&#xD;
As Walter advanced, the young lady arose and moved qui-&#xD;
etly away.&#xD;
That night was a restless one for Walter. He could not&#xD;
command the forgetfulness of slumber, for the image of the&#xD;
young lady at his mother's grave-side hung about his pillow ;&#xD;
but now it was no longer the sinister vision that had haunted&#xD;
so long his footsteps, but a benignant spirit, attuned to'him by&#xD;
the sympathy of grief, that would nestle in his bosom.&#xD;
For weeks after, as he continued daily to visit the grave-&#xD;
yard where reposed the sacred remains of his mother, he&#xD;
would often find there the same young female. He watched&#xD;
her and studied her closely. Everything seemed to indicate&#xD;
that she was drawn to the spot by the genuine sympathy of&#xD;
grief. In that light she grew, in his eyes, inexpressibly lovely,&#xD;
and he longed to have free communion with her soul.&#xD;
He could restrain himself no longer;, and one day, as he&#xD;
found her still by the side of the grave, he walked boldly up&#xD;
and accosted her. As she turned her full eyes upon his, a&#xD;
deep carnation suffusing her face, the strange image that had&#xD;

niece. At the time of her shipwreck, she was making her&#xD;
visit to her brother's, and when Walter encountered her on&#xD;
board the ship that rescued him, she was returning to settle up&#xD;
her affairs preparatory to making her home in the Western&#xD;
world. She was now on her way thither, - and how fortunate&#xD;
the meeting !&#xD;
"Ah, what treachery have we here," shouted Capt. Jame-&#xD;
son. I came in all weathers North, to claim my lady love,&#xD;
and make a bridal tour in my clipper brig, but here I find her&#xD;
in the arms of another. Is this the way you serve a brother&#xD;
mess-mate ?"--addressing Walter.&#xD;
The latter turned, with a. gentle bow, to Isadore.&#xD;
" 0 no, " responded the latter, archly. " A nature so gen-&#xD;
erous as yours needs kindred qualities in a companion. Let&#xD;
me commend you, my dear Capt. Jameson, to my adorable&#xD;
friend, Md'le Radesky. The latter gracefully smiled, and the&#xD;
two entered into lively conversation upon the present state of&#xD;
Poland.&#xD;
The preliminaries were soon arranged. Walter and Isadore&#xD;
were to wait a year, out of respect to the death of his mother,&#xD;
before their marriage was to be consummated. In the mean&#xD;
time, Capt. Jameson was to make one more voyage, and Md'le&#xD;
was to repair to the West, and bring her niece to witness the&#xD;
ceremony.&#xD;
Time flew swiftly. It was a joyful day at the old mansion.&#xD;
Relations, friends and neighbors were gathered in joyful con-&#xD;
gratulation. Maidens and youth attired in their prettiest, and,&#xD;
with exultant hopes, were present to view the ceremony.&#xD;
Esq. Langdon appeared, in order to tie the hymeneal knot. At&#xD;
length there entered the room Walter and Isadore, Capt. How-&#xD;
ard Jameson and Md'le Sophie Radesky. People could not at&#xD;

panions, or had come really to experience the rosy fate of&#xD;
Walter and his bride. But the Esq. soon cleared up all doubt&#xD;
upon that point, by tying between the gallant captain and his&#xD;
spouse, the endeared knot that knows no untying.&#xD;
The next day, the entire party, including the beautiful Ad-&#xD;
elgitha, who was betrothed to an American gentleman, worthy&#xD;

Radesky, in Ohio, amid the parting benedictions of friends.&#xD;
