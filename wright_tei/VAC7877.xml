CHAPTER I.&#xD;
THE VALE OF SHANNONDALE.&#xD;
Oh, sparkling clear thy waters flow,&#xD;
And murmur as they glide,&#xD;
To the thir trees that bend below&#xD;
To kiss the loving tide;&#xD;
And far above the mountains stand,&#xD;
Like watch towers placed to guard a land&#xD;
Where alt conspires to yield delight,&#xD;
Where pleasure reigns by day and night.&#xD;
S/iantzondale.-L. M. SMITH.&#xD;
The valley of the Shenandoah presents a suc-&#xD;
cession of the most various, sublime and beauti-&#xD;
ful landscapes in the world. The Shenandoah,&#xD;
which yet retains its ancient, beautiful, and&#xD;
poetic indian name, springs among the magnifi-&#xD;
cent rocks of the Cyclopean towers. These&#xD;
towers, seven in number, rise to the height of&#xD;
several hundred feet, like the ruins of some stu-&#xD;
pendous ancient feudal castle, erected to guard&#xD;
the passes of this magnificent valley. Flowing&#xD;
on through a beautiful and fertile vale, hemmed&#xD;
in by mountains, and supposed to have been&#xD;
once the bed of an ancient lake with its high&#xD;
and rocky banks, the Shenandoah passes Weir's&#xD;
Oav-e, one of the greatest natural wonderAn the&#xD;
new world, and quite worthy to be ranked, (says&#xD;
an English tourist) with the Natural Bridge or&#xD;
Niagara, and equal in dimensions, and in the&#xD;
variety, beauty and sublimity of its objects, to&#xD;
the celebrated Grotto of Antiparos. Still flowing&#xD;
on,. the majestic river washes the Western pre-&#xD;
cipices of the Blue Ridge, forming in its serpen-&#xD;
tine course, islands and pr Jones, some high,&#xD;
barren blasted, othei~s covered with beauti-&#xD;
ful vend &amp;amp; or crowned with lofty trees. Yet&#xD;
flowing on, the mighty riven, gathering force&#xD;
from every tributary, rushes with frightfully in-&#xD;
creasing power and rapidity to meet the Poto-&#xD;
mac, and with a god-tike strength to rend a pas.&#xD;
sage through the mountains to the ocean.&#xD;
'i'h~ stupendous sublimity of this awful scene&#xD;
was said by Thomas Jefferson to be worth a&#xD;
voyage across the Atlantic-when a voyage&#xD;
across the ocean was an affair of six months.&#xD;
But it is the Vale of Shannondale, the scene of&#xD;
&#xD;
my present romance of r~al life, that I wish to&#xD;
describe. A few miles below Harper's Ferry,&#xD;
the Blue Ridge makes a curve, hemming in a&#xD;
beautiful and fertile vale in the shape of a horse&#xD;
shoe, whose opening is on the South. Within&#xD;
the curve of the ridge, washing its base, and en-&#xD;
circling the vale, rushes the Shenandoah. From&#xD;
the river the ground rises gradually toward the&#xD;
South Ttiis lovely spot combines enchanting&#xD;
beauty with majestic sublimity. Hemmed in by&#xD;
lofty mountains, and encircled by a rushing&#xD;
river, shaded by groves of lofty trees, freshened&#xD;
by springs .and fountains of sparkling water, fra-&#xD;
grant with millions of wild flowers, and musical&#xD;
with the voices of thousands of birds, it reulizes&#xD;
the vision of the Rasselas' Happy VaPey.&#xD;
Many years since, it does not matter how&#xD;
many, stood on this favored spot an ancient man-&#xD;
sion, one of the first erected in the valley of rue&#xD;
Shenandoah.&#xD;
The legend of its erection runs thus; In&#xD;
the latter part of the reign of Elizabeth, during&#xD;
the last persecution of the Catholics by thst&#xD;
Princess, the head of a noble Catholic family m&#xD;
Wiltshire, England, emigrated to Virginia. The&#xD;
settlements were then all near the seacoast, or&#xD;
upon the banks of James River and the~ Rappa..&#xD;
hannock. All the country West of the Blue&#xD;
Ridge was unknown. The valley of Virginia&#xD;
was traversed by hordes of war-like savages,&#xD;
who sometimes crossed the mountains and made&#xD;
fearful and destructive descents upon thq.. ~n-&#xD;
protected settlements, and whose veiy. yell.&#xD;
were a horror. Soon after his arrival, Lord&#xD;
Summerfield formed an exploring and hunting&#xD;
party, who purposed crossing the mountain t&#xD;
explore the country and to hunt the deer.&#xD;
This boarding the lions in their dens was an&#xD;
enterprise requiring great courage, ppidenee and&#xD;
fortitude. Lord Summerfield possessed RU three&#xD;
in an eminent degree. He set out with his party&#xD;
fully equipped for several months exploring,&#xD;
fighting or hunting, and after maty days of aIter~&#xD;
nate travelling, sporting, skirmishing and rest&#xD;
during which they had successfully evaded or&#xD;
repulsed the savages who would have interrupted&#xD;
their expedition, early in October they rea~shed&#xD;
the sublime and beautiful Vale of 8h~bw~n&#xD;

&#xD;
encircled by its sparkling river, and s~ut in by&#xD;
its majestic mountains. Here astonished at the&#xD;
stupendous grandeur, fascinated by the charming&#xD;
beauty of the-landscape, delighted with the luxu-&#xD;
riant fertility of the soil, and the exhilarating&#xD;
purity of the climate, Lord Summerfield stand-&#xD;
ing ul~on the lofty mountain on the North, and&#xD;
looking down upon this scene of wonderful&#xD;
beauty and grandeur, exclaimed,&#xD;
"This is a spot to dare and do for! Here I&#xD;
plant my family again! here I pitch my tent!&#xD;
Here will I live, here die, and here be buried I"&#xD;
The party continued their hunting and explo-&#xD;
ring a few weeks longer, until the frosts and&#xD;
keen winds of winter warned them to return to&#xD;
the settlements, which they just reached by the&#xD;
Christmas festivities.&#xD;
Lord Summerfield was as good as his word.-&#xD;
Immediately upon reaching home he commenced&#xD;
preparations for emigrating thither in the spring.&#xD;
His fellow colonists endeavored to dissuade him&#xD;
from so hazardous a purpose, but in valn,-he&#xD;
seemed possessed with the Vale of Shannondale&#xD;
..Land neither the arguments or entreaties of his&#xD;
friends, present difficulty, toil, privation, orpro-&#xD;
spective danger and death could turn him from&#xD;
his purpose. He contrived to rescue enough&#xD;
from the wreck of his English estates to pur-&#xD;
chase the laud from the savages, whose favor he&#xD;
conciliated by two, with them, all powerful&#xD;
means, naniely-by placing perfect confidence&#xD;
in them, in coming to live so far from the settle-&#xD;
ments~ alone, among them, and by making them&#xD;
many useful and showy presents. He sent over&#xD;
an agent to England, where under pain of death&#xD;
he dared not return in person, to collect together&#xD;
the scattered remnants of his property, to pur-&#xD;
chase and ship to him building materials, house&#xD;
furniture, hunting and farming implements, and&#xD;
in short every thing that was needed to create a&#xD;
civilized home in the grand and beautiful wilder-&#xD;
ness upon which he had set his heart. Another&#xD;
mission he entrusted to his agent, a letterof ten-&#xD;
der farewell to his young and beautiful cousin&#xD;
and betrothed bride living in Wiltshire, at Long-&#xD;
ford Castle, under the care of her aunt, the&#xD;
Marchioness of Northampton. His letter was&#xD;
full of strength, tenderness and hopeful love. He&#xD;
bade her wait in patience and in confidence until&#xD;
he had made this wild and lovely vale "bloom&#xD;
and blossom as the rose," until his house, his&#xD;
gardens, and Ass parks in the new world should&#xD;
equal in comfort and elegance her sumptuous re-&#xD;
sjdence in the old one. Finally until the rapidly&#xD;
growing country should be~sufficiently settle to&#xD;
make it a safe retreat for ~r. Then he said he&#xD;
would transplant his violet to the Vale of Shan-&#xD;
nondale. Could he indeed expect the beautiful,&#xD;
refined and cherished daughter of aristocratic&#xD;
wealth and luxury to join him in his wild hunting&#xD;
cabin. It never once entered his mind.&#xD;
Viola, of Summerfield! the most fair and fm-t&#xD;
&#xD;
gile looking human flower that ever bloomed its&#xD;
day in the parterres of a palace conservatory I-&#xD;
Expose her to a wilderness life! No! it was&#xD;
not to be thought of. So said Lady Northamp-&#xD;
ton when she had started Lord Summerfield to&#xD;
America; and yet she was only thinking at that&#xD;
time of the settlement! How much more dreadful,&#xD;
then, the idea, had it ever presented itself to her,&#xD;
of exposing Viola to the almost certainly fatal&#xD;
toils, privations and perils of the fearful moun-&#xD;
tain passes infested with savage beasts and more&#xD;
savage men.&#xD;
Viola, of Summerfield, was in her luxurious&#xD;
bower at Longford Castle, when the letter from&#xD;
her lover was placed in her hand. She caught&#xD;
it with a bound of joy-it was the first time she&#xD;
had heard from him since his departure. She&#xD;
tore it open, and read it with a palpitating heart.&#xD;
Then her eyes filled and overflowed with tears.&#xD;
She folded it quietly up, and formed a resolu-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
In the meantime, Lord Summerfield, upon the&#xD;
Rappahannock, was impatiently waiting the re-&#xD;
turn of the ship that was to bring out his cargo.&#xD;
The spring opened, and he had not heard from&#xD;
the vessel. At last, wishing to vget a small gar-&#xD;
den under cultivation, that very season he set&#xD;
out on horseback, attended by two hired men,&#xD;
also mounted, for his valley estate, having left&#xD;
orders that his agent should land the cargo, and&#xD;
transport it in wagons to the spot selected for&#xD;
building. It was as early as the first of March&#xD;
when he set out,-it was near the last of the&#xD;
same month that he found himself again in the&#xD;
Vale of Shannondale. Already the snows had&#xD;
melted oft the mountains, and the young grass&#xD;
was springing in the valley, and the trees putting&#xD;
forth young buds in the forest. He went to&#xD;
work with his two men, and felled trees and&#xD;
built a cabin of logs as a temporary shelter.-&#xD;
Then~e began to hedge in a small garden, which&#xD;
the two men prepared for the seed. Every day&#xD;
as the spring advanced, revealed new beauties&#xD;
in the charming landscape, and increased the&#xD;
impatience ol Lord Summerfield to add all the&#xD;
improvements of civilization and art to the&#xD;
loveliness and grandeur of nature, The air&#xD;
was populous with wild fowl, the forests filled&#xD;
with game, and~ th aautiful river alive with&#xD;
the finest fish. $ron ore an ed sand-&#xD;
stone, a beautiful material for hull bound.&#xD;
ed in the mountains, and springs of r~~eral wa-&#xD;
ter, tlt4dmirable medicinal qua1ities~of which&#xD;
he was chemist enough to appreciate, Wer~ free-&#xD;
ly dispersed about the~ vale. Indeed, it seemed&#xD;
that nature, in a fit of extravagant liberality,&#xD;
had here lavished all her rarest and inos~t~j~stly&#xD;
treasures. c~ was a land to die for !"~ And&#xD;
Lord Summerfield worked like a day-laborer on&#xD;
hire, to get it under cultivation, while he ani.&#xD;
iously expected his teams.&#xD;
At length, one evening in May, when all the&#xD;

when the two men, ifirarn and Peter, had pie- -for it seemed piteous to see that fair, fragile&#xD;

trees, or gazing with awe upon the majestic hand of one among them in lowly reverence to&#xD;

reached the Villa on the Thames-she succeeded&#xD;
in getting a private interview with the Queen,&#xD;
who came, at her request, to visit her. Some-&#xD;
thing frightful passed at that interview, I be.&#xD;
lieve; at least my poor aunt died in great an-&#xD;
guish soon after, and it is said that the Queen&#xD;
has never held up her head since. Well, Ha-&#xD;
rold, I found myself mistress of my own fortune&#xD;
and person. As soon as [got over the shock&#xD;
and grief of my dear aunt's death, I began to&#xD;
think of communicating the news to you. I had&#xD;
written a letter, and was waiting for a ship to'&#xD;
carry it, when your letter arrived. I read it,&#xD;
Harold, and I determined to put all my property&#xD;
in cash, and to join you in the wilderness; dear&#xD;
Harold, were we not betrothed, and had I not a&#xD;
rsgkt to do so if 1 pleased? I told some of my&#xD;
aunt's friends. They broke out against me as&#xD;
unwomanly, indelicate; and, though I felt that&#xD;
it was not as they said, yet I fee,~ed, that you&#xD;
would think with them-but, you do not~ do&#xD;
you, Harold? Do you think lightly of me for&#xD;
following you out here?"&#xD;
"My blessed saint! it were a blasphemy to&#xD;
think an evil thought of you!" exclaimed Lord&#xD;
Summerfield, fervently.&#xD;
"Oh, please do not say such extravagant&#xD;
things of me5 dear Harold! It mortifies me even&#xD;
more than reproof would-because, alas !-I' am&#xD;
so far from deserving commendation, still less&#xD;
praise.~~&#xD;
"You are beyond and above praise, my darling&#xD;
Viola-go on with your narrative, dearest one."&#xD;
"Well, Father White then had been ordered to&#xD;
quit England, under pain of dhath, within ten&#xD;
days; I concealed him at Longford Castle; he&#xD;
was there when your letter came; I told him of&#xD;
my project to join you in America-I asked his&#xD;
counsel-and oh, Harold, I hung breathless upon&#xD;
the words of his reply, for I have unbounded&#xD;
confidence in his wisdom and goodness; and if&#xD;
he had given his voice against my voyage-per.&#xD;
baps, pet-kept, Harold, I should not have come-&#xD;
perhaps nothing but your own summons would&#xD;
then have brought me. But our reverend, and&#xD;
most beloved friend, approved my decision-nay,&#xD;
he applauded it, and blessed me from the fullness&#xD;
of his joy, and told me that he would himself ac-&#xD;
company me to America. Well, Harold, Father&#xD;
White and myself had many consultations. He&#xD;
knew several of your friends, who, persecuted in&#xD;
England, wished to settle somewhere else. He&#xD;
beld many secret conferences with them, the re-&#xD;
suit of which was, that we formed a party from&#xD;
our own neighborhood to come over, and here we&#xD;
all are. We would have announced our inten-&#xD;
tionAthad any ship been leaving England for&#xD;
America; but our own, in which we came, was&#xD;
really the first that left of the season. So here&#xD;
we are, dear Harold-your tenants, your friends,&#xD;
&#xD;
N DALE.&#xD;
and your wife-but oh, Harold! you do not&#xD;
blame me in your heart for ibis ?"&#xD;
"My darling, darling girl, do you want me to&#xD;
be an idolater; do you want me to fall at your&#xD;
feet and adore you ?" said Summertield, embra-&#xD;
cing her fondly.&#xD;
The purple shades of evening were approaching&#xD;
-the stars were coming out one by oae-the&#xD;
dew was falling-the travellers descended the&#xD;
hill to the spot where their wagons had been&#xD;
left, and some took out the tents, carried them&#xD;
up the hill, and pitched them, and some turned&#xD;
the wagons down for sleeping places. During&#xD;
all this time Lord Summerfield and Viola sat&#xD;
under the old oak tree discoursing. The priest&#xD;
again stood before them&#xD;
"My children! there must be a marriage here&#xD;
to-night! do you not know it? Have you not&#xD;
thought of it? I have been waiting to receive&#xD;
some communication upon the subject, and now&#xD;
I have to break the matter myself; for well as&#xD;
you love each other, I do not believe you have&#xD;
thought of marriage this evening."&#xD;
That was true. They had thought of nothing.&#xD;
They were lost in the delight of merely meeting&#xD;
and talking with each other again. That was&#xD;
true, until now-but now the priest's words sent&#xD;
an electric shock of ecstacy through every nerve&#xD;
of Summerfield, and threw the delicate Viola i4l~&#xD;
to a tremor of vague apprehension. Without a&#xD;
word, however, Summerfield arose, and raising&#xD;
Viola, and drawing her arm through his own, he&#xD;
requested FathV White to summon his friends,&#xD;
and follow him into the cabin.&#xD;
Then and there they were married.&#xD;
They lived in the log 'cabin about the cent~&amp;amp;&#xD;
of the vale. The other settlers selected farms&#xD;
on the other side of the river, over the mounr&#xD;
tains, or back into the depth ofthe forest, which&#xD;
they began to cut down. The beautiful Vale of&#xD;
Shannqpdale was left to the Summerfields. Tbe~&#xD;
settlers did everything in their power to soften&#xD;
the hard lot the fragile Viola had taken upon&#xD;
herself when she became the wife of a pioneer.&#xD;
As years passed, the bracing air and the fine&#xD;
water of the mountains, so invigorated Viola,&#xD;
that from being an extremely delicate girl she&#xD;
was 4rowing to be a fine robust woman. In the&#xD;
course of two years, a handsome and substantial&#xD;
house of red sandstone was erected in the vale.&#xD;
This house was furnished with far more taste&#xD;
and elegance~than usually appertained to the&#xD;
dwellings of the early settlers. But one child, a&#xD;
handsome, hearty boy, named after his father,&#xD;
Harold, blessed this happy marriage, and from&#xD;
him were descended all the Summerfields, pro-&#xD;
prietors of the vale, until 17-, when it came&#xD;
into the hands of the last of that house And&#xD;
this is the tradition of the early settlement of&#xD;
the Vale of Shannondale.&#xD;
&#xD;
SITIANNO&#xD;
CHAPTER Ii.&#xD;
THE OLD REDSTONE HOUSE.&#xD;
That dear old home!&#xD;
Something of old ancestral pride it keeps.&#xD;
Though fallen from its early power and vastness,&#xD;
The sun light seems to their eyes brighter there&#xD;
Than wheresoever else.      hl(rs. Kem6 it.&#xD;
I love to make you familiar with the localities&#xD;
of our stories; the grounds about which our peo-&#xD;
ple walked; the house in which they dwelt; .the&#xD;
rooms in which tht~y lived and loved, or sinned&#xD;
and suffered. 1 will strive to place 'Red-Stone&#xD;
Hall, the seat of the Summerfields at Shannon-&#xD;
dale, vividly before you. Pray assist me with&#xD;
your own attention and imagination.&#xD;
The house was situated about half-tray up the&#xD;
gradually rising hill. Behind the house was the&#xD;
dark and grim oldforest. Before the house, the&#xD;
ground, green with verdure, and dotted with&#xD;
groves of old forest trees, descended to the river,&#xD;
that, rushing around with a sweeping curve,&#xD;
forms the shape of a horse-shoe; across the river&#xD;
tower the lofty mountains that shut in' the&#xD;
vale.&#xD;
The house itself was built after the manner of&#xD;
most old Virginian mansions, with more massive&#xD;
strength than elegance; more breadth than&#xD;
height, and with more respect to convenience&#xD;
than to appearances, and hence the result was,&#xD;
greater durability, comfort, and pi~hturesque ef-&#xD;
fect, than order and regulari. It had been&#xD;
constructed of the rich and brilliant jed sand.&#xD;
stone, found in the mountains. Its form was&#xD;
square and narrows with a high-peaked roof-&#xD;
its color, dark red. Its foundations had been&#xD;
laid broad, deep, and strong, and upon them were&#xD;
raised two stories, crowned by an attic, with dor-&#xD;
inor windows.&#xD;
It was surrounded by a low wall built also of&#xD;
red sand-stone; in the centre of which, immedi-&#xD;
ately in front of the house, was an iron gate that&#xD;
opened upon a brick-paved rqad, shaded on each&#xD;
side by elm trees, and which led straight up to&#xD;
the front main entrance of the house, a substan-&#xD;
tial portico.&#xD;
This portico admitted into the wide passage&#xD;
that ran through the middle of the house, dlvi.&#xD;
ding it into equal parts. In the centre of the&#xD;
back of 'this passage was the staircase, with its&#xD;
broad and polished oak steps, and its balustrades&#xD;
of mahogany, turning off in a scroll to the right&#xD;
and left of the bottom step.&#xD;
On thn right of this passage was situated first&#xD;
the front drawing-room, whose windows looked&#xD;
out upon the river and the mountains, including&#xD;
the vale; and behind that, the large saloon, only&#xD;
used for balls, &amp;amp;c., and whose back windows&#xD;
looked out upon the grim old pine forest behind&#xD;
the house. These rooms had been recently fit-&#xD;
ted up in handsome modern style.&#xD;
&#xD;
NDALE                                  7&#xD;
On the left of the passage was first the&#xD;
front parlor, whose windows commanded the&#xD;
same view with those of the front drawing-&#xD;
room; next, the dining-room, and behind that,&#xD;
the comfortable family sitting-room; it is to&#xD;
this apartment that I shall soon introduce you.&#xD;
The furniture of these rooms were old as the&#xD;
house itself. Behind the house, and connected&#xD;
with it by shaded piazzas, were wings; that on&#xD;
the right containing the still-room, used for dis-&#xD;
tilling herbs, essences, &amp;amp;c., and for preparing&#xD;
cordials, bounces, domestic wines, &amp;amp;c. It was&#xD;
filled with closets, in which these domestic trea-&#xD;
sures were stowed away ;-the carding and&#xD;
spinning-room-the weaving-room, &amp;amp;c. That&#xD;
on the left contained the pantry, the kitchen,&#xD;
the scullery, and the laundry.&#xD;
Scattered about in the forest, behind the house,&#xD;
were the cabins of the negroes, who worked the&#xD;
farm.&#xD;
At the time our story opens, the only repre-&#xD;
eentatives of the Summerfield family were Mrs.&#xD;
Margary Summerfield, the widow of Harold liar..&#xD;
dinge, the last of the Summerfields, and Imogene,&#xD;
her only child-the heiress of that large estate.&#xD;
At this time Imogene Summerfield was finishing&#xD;
her education at the convent school of George-&#xD;
town. The August holidays were at hand when&#xD;
she was expected to leave school permanently,&#xD;
and great preparations were being made at Red-&#xD;
Stone Hall for her reception. It was in honor&#xD;
of this event that the drawing-room and saloon&#xD;
had been splendidly re-furnis~he A ball and&#xD;
supper was to celebrate the co~iiing out of the&#xD;
young and beautiful heiress of the once noble&#xD;
house of Summerfield.&#xD;
Mrs. Summerfield had invited party of young ~&#xD;
people to Red-Stone Hall to welcome he~r daugh...&#xD;
ter upon her return home-among them~were her&#xD;
niece, Winifred Darling, the only daughter of&#xD;
her only brother, Squire Darling, of Oak Grove,&#xD;
with her companion or humble friend, Sinai&#xD;
Hinton, and Harriette Joy, the niece of the old&#xD;
priest, Father Burleigh, who for fifty years had&#xD;
ministered at the altar of the Catholic Chapel of&#xD;
the Sacred-Heart&#xD;
This party of young people deserve farther&#xD;
notice than I have given them. First, Miss&#xD;
Darling, or Winny Darling as she was fondly&#xD;
called by her young friends, was the loveliest&#xD;
and most loving little creature that ever blessed&#xD;
a doting father's heart.&#xD;
She was his only child-a loive chjld, the&#xD;
child of his adored wife, who had given this&#xD;
angel life at the price of her own..&#xD;
Far back of the old hail at Oak Grove there&#xD;
was a marble monument-it was the tomb of&#xD;
Angela Darling.&#xD;
Squire Darling had wished to name his little&#xD;
daughter after his lost angel, but his mother,&#xD;
Winifred Darling, with a. good O~liolic's care&#xD;

SHANNONPALE.               9&#xD;
&#xD;
Oak Grove was a fine old baronial-looking&#xD;
residence. The hall stood in the midst of a&#xD;
grove of gigantic forest oaks, which gave their&#xD;
name to the homestead. There wa~ no under-&#xD;
growth, and the gass was green and smooth as&#xD;
velvet-so that even in the Autumn the~ deep&#xD;
shade of the magnificent trees was healthful as&#xD;
pleasant. Fine orchards, fine gardens, 'and well&#xD;
cultivated fields, surrounded Oak Grove. The&#xD;
estate was the best stocked with cattle in the&#xD;
whole country-while a stable of thorough-bred&#xD;
and well-trained horses and a kennel of the&#xD;
finest hounds formed the delight of the squire.&#xD;
The cabins of the negroes who worked the&#xD;
plantation were apart by themselves, in a green&#xD;
glen. The little houses were built ten on each&#xD;
side of the road, thus forming a street. They&#xD;
were all uniform, painted white, and with one&#xD;
door between two windows in front, painted red.&#xD;
Each had its little garden behind, and its apple,&#xD;
pear, or peach tree shading in front. At the&#xD;
head of this street, crossing it at right angles&#xD;
and facing down it, was the overseer's house.&#xD;
This was also white with red doors and win-&#xD;
dow-shutters-but it was larger and more com-&#xD;
modious than the others, and it had a piazza and&#xD;
a flower-yard in front, and a larger garden be-&#xD;
hind. The overseer was an old colored man, an&#xD;
attached servant of the family, whose father and&#xD;
grandfather had belonged to the Darlings. Like&#xD;
most other Virginia negroes he had assumed his&#xD;
master's family name, and called himself Squire&#xD;
Darling. His baptismal name ~as Achilles, but&#xD;
the family called him Uncle Kill. From sun-&#xD;
rise to sunset, except two hours for breakfast&#xD;
and two hours for dinner, Uncle Kill's duties of&#xD;
overseer kept him in the field, where he was a&#xD;
perfect bug-a-boo to a lazy hand. The rest of&#xD;
the time Uncle Kill preached the Gospel, played&#xD;
the fiddle, told fortunes, tracked the coon, or&#xD;
made himself otherwise useful or agreeable.&#xD;
Uncle Kill had a wife near his own age, called&#xD;
Minerva, but whose celestial name, the bad&#xD;
taste of the household had be-devilled as it had&#xD;
that of her lord, Achilles. They called her&#xD;
"Nerve." And this was no misnomer, she&#xD;
was a woman of great nervous energy. (It is a&#xD;
pity, by the way, that this word "nervous," in&#xD;
the same relations, expresses such opposite&#xD;
meanings-for the laborer's, "nervous&#xD;
means his great strong powerful Ic&#xD;
while Miss Fanny Faintaway's" ualis~bs"&#xD;
means her weak, trembling, ailing, fainting~&#xD;
members.) Nerve was a woman of strong body,&#xD;
strong affectie strong opinions, and strong&#xD;
methods of cx sing them-.-strong will, and a&#xD;
strong way of expressing it. Nerve's office on&#xD;
the plan - , was a general supervision of the&#xD;
spinning, ing, knitting and other women's&#xD;
work; and she was as efficient in her way, as&#xD;
Uncle Kill was in his.&#xD;
When Sina Ilinton arrived at Oak Grove, the&#xD;
&#xD;
fine old hall, the grand old forest-trees, the&#xD;
wealth of the estate with its negroes, its fields,&#xD;
gardens, orchards, and stock of every descrip..&#xD;
tion, excited her admiration and provoked her&#xD;
envy-admiration of the estate, envy 01) its&#xD;
heiress. Such a set of feelings could not arise in&#xD;
a strong, subtle, and unprincipled nature like&#xD;
hers, without sooner or later becoming the mas-&#xD;
ter motives of her actions. She watched the&#xD;
favorable points of her position, and resolved to&#xD;
take the greatest advantage of every one. For&#xD;
"Why should this silly, simpering, cooing little&#xD;
fool have all this great plantation, and I, her&#xD;
cousin, have none ?" she said. The respect with&#xD;
which she was treated by Madam Winifred and&#xD;
the squire-the aflectio~ate confidence reposed&#xD;
in her by Winny, the esteem she had won from&#xD;
the tutor, a ore available for her purposes, and&#xD;
most of all w the deep unspoken love that her&#xD;
keen subtilty perceived to exist between Edgar&#xD;
Ardenne, the tutor, and Winny Darling. "If&#xD;
this foolish attachment should provoke her fa-&#xD;
ther to disinherit her-at least the chance is not&#xD;
bad. The very fervor of her father's love for&#xD;
Winny, if that love were abandoned for a passion&#xD;
for another, and outraged by disobedience in&#xD;
marrying that other against his consent-yes I&#xD;
the very love of her father turned to wrath,:&#xD;
would drive him to disown the ingrate daughter.&#xD;
But the fools of lovers are so slow, they Would&#xD;
content themselves with their present life ten&#xD;
years yet, and never take another step unless&#xD;
something happened to rouse up opposition I&#xD;
That I know would soon kindle their dep, ~&#xD;
calm love-deep and calm as the depths of ~ &#xD;
sea before a storm-.into a ~apsionl into a tem~&#xD;
pest! I must put my ~hei4der to &amp;amp;is wheel P'&#xD;
When a good heart and a1 strong mind deter- A&#xD;
mine upon a good act-the angels assist that soul&#xD;
with an opportunity. When a bad man or wo-&#xD;
man with the necessary strength of wilt resolve&#xD;
upon a~ evil end, the devil is faithful to&#xD;

Sina Hinton had arrived in July. It was the&#xD;
latter part of the month that Miss )arling and&#xD;
herself were invited to make a visit to Red-&#xD;
Stone Hall, to be there to welcome Miss Sum-&#xD;
merfield, the cousin of the latter, to her home.&#xD;
The distance from Oak Grove to Red-Stone&#xD;
Hall was fifteen miles; but with their fleet&#xD;
horses the Oak Grove family frequently rode it&#xD;
early in the morning, dined, supped, and' re- -&#xD;
turned in the evening; sometimes by moonlight&#xD;
or starlight; and nothing could be more delight-&#xD;
ful than those fine night rides through the fresh,&#xD;
green, dark forest, after the heat of an oppres-.&#xD;

ness of the evening breeze-tbe brightness of the&#xD;
wonderful stars-the vague, romantic dimness of&#xD;
the forest aisles-all conspired to refresh the&#xD;
nerves and inspire the minds.&#xD;
84 Hinton, the astute girl, had noticed the&#xD;
effect of these forest night rides-and she always&#xD;
took care to drop behind or ride on before, ma-&#xD;
king the excuse that the path was not wide&#xD;
enough for three equestrians .-and thus she&#xD;
would give the lovers every opportunity of im~&#xD;
proving the romance, and yielding to the tempta-&#xD;
tion of the hour. It was in vain though as yet,&#xD;
their affection was too childlike, too simple, con-&#xD;
fiding and happy, to inspire the wish for a&#xD;
change. And it was this that made Sina Hinton&#xD;
exclaim in her vexatioff against the apathy of&#xD;
the lovers.&#xD;
It was this that made her resoI~re to bring&#xD;
about a denouement.&#xD;
It turned out to be a very sultry day, that upon&#xD;
*      wiuich Miss Darling had intended to set out for&#xD;
*      Red-Stone Hall. Miss Hinton proposed that they&#xD;
should defer it until evening, and take the ride&#xD;
through the forest by starlight. This was&#xD;
agreed upon-and accordingly, after tea Winny&#xD;
kissed her grandmother, who promised soon to&#xD;
join her at Shannondale, and kissed her father,&#xD;
who pledged his word to follow the next day,&#xD;
and went down to the quarters and took an af-&#xD;
fectionate leave of her "old women," as she&#xD;
called all the superannuated negresses whose&#xD;
comfort was her peculiar care-and accompa-&#xD;
nied by Sina Hinton and attended by Edgar&#xD;
.44 ~rdenne, set out for her ride. Sina Hinton drop~&#xD;
ped behind as usual; and again as usual the&#xD;
child-like lovers dropped into a reverie, broken&#xD;
only by low toned observations by one of them&#xD;
and a soft assent by the other! They reached&#xD;
the Vale of Shannondale and Red-Stone Hall by&#xD;
ten o'clock-and there they found assembled&#xD;
Father Burleigh, the aged priest, her niece, Har-&#xD;
riette or Harry Joy, and lastly, Colon4Henry&#xD;
Lee Dungerfield, a relation of the Suminerfield&#xD;
family,:dnd the owner of the largest estate in&#xD;
the neighborhood. He was an officer of the&#xD;
army, who had distinguished himself in the re-&#xD;
cent war of the Revolution-and had now return-&#xD;
ed to private life covered with military glory.&#xD;
Miss Summerfield had been betrothed to him&#xD;
ever since she was an infant and he a lad. She&#xD;
had grown in beauty by his side, and he had&#xD;
loved her in a gentle, domestic way, and was ac-&#xD;
customed to think of her as his future wife. She&#xD;
had left home at fifteen years of age, and he had&#xD;
not seen her for three years. He had as a mat-&#xD;
ter of course been invited to Red4tone Hall to&#xD;
welcome tier. Mrs. Summerfield, leaving re-&#xD;

riage wheels disturbed the silence; at twelve&#xD;
o'clock the company gave her up for the night,&#xD;
and retired to bed. The next night was the&#xD;
time appointed for the grand ball that was to&#xD;
celebrate Miss Summerfield's coming out.&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
IMOOENE sUlWMEarIELD.&#xD;
She was a Catholic, too, sincere, austere,&#xD;
As far as her own gentle heart allowed,&#xD;
And deemed that fallen worship far more dear&#xD;
Because 'twas fallen ;-her sires were proud&#xD;
Of deeds and days when they had filled the ear&#xD;
Of nations, and had never bent or bowed&#xD;
To novel power; and as she was the last,&#xD;
She held their old faith and old feelings fast.&#xD;

Early the next morning the guests assembled&#xD;
at Shannondale, met in the piazak-that right&#xD;
hand front piazza that commanded the slope of&#xD;
the grove-shaded hill as it rolled to the river, of&#xD;
the rushing circular5 sweep of the river, and of the&#xD;
surrounding towering mountains. Right across&#xD;
the river, opposite to them, was the Lover's&#xD;
Leap-a bold perpendicular rock, with a wild&#xD;
Indian legend connected with it.&#xD;
"Who knows the story ?" inquired Sina Hin.&#xD;
ton.&#xD;
"Every one knows it, but no one tells it but&#xD;
Father Burleigh, and he never tells it in any other&#xD;
place but the summit of the rock," replied Col.&#xD;
Lee Dangerfield.&#xD;
Sina Hinton sauntered, swayed and undulated&#xD;
up to the side of Father Burleigh, and said in&#xD;
her mellifluous, coaxing tones-&#xD;
"Oh! Father Burleigh, will you not form a&#xD;
party over to Lover's Leap to-day and tell the&#xD;
story? I do so love those wild legends--and I&#xD;
should so delight to get a view of this vale from.&#xD;
that prominence."&#xD;
Father Burleigh. was about to decline, upon&#xD;
the score of his infirmities and the fatigue of as-&#xD;
ce the hill, but Sine's large, dark, pleading&#xD;
eye         ed on his own, and there was no&#xD;
resisting th   He said that he would do so&#xD;
"with pleasure," if it were agreeable to the rest&#xD;
of the company.&#xD;
"Of course it will be agreca to the rest of&#xD;
the party," exclaimed Harriett oy. "Let us&#xD;
go, uncle; Mts. and Miss Summerfield will not&#xD;
be here till night now, and I want d oppor-&#xD;
tunity for a sentimental flirtation -I know&#xD;
who!"&#xD;
"Will you never be steady, Harry-never de-&#xD;
port yourself like a lady," whispered the priest.&#xD;
&#xD;
SHAWNO&#xD;
"Never while you abbreviate my pretty a&#xD;
of Harriette to Harry! It makes me feel like&#xD;
a boy !" laughed Harriette, as she placed a&#xD;
strawhatjauntilyupob her head; and in fact with&#xD;
her roguish black eyes, laughing lips, and clus-&#xD;
tering curls, her mirthful countenance, half in&#xD;
dark shadow from the rim of the hat, half in&#xD;
light from the kissing of the sunshine, Harry Joy&#xD;
looked like a sauey-a very saucy boy, and no-&#xD;
thing else.&#xD;
"I could fall desperately in love with that&#xD;
little imp !" mused Colonel Lee Dangerfield, as&#xD;
he leaned against a pillar of the piazza and con-&#xD;
templated Harry-" she has just eccentricity&#xD;
enough to bewilder all one's senses; but this will&#xD;
not do. I must take my eyes off."&#xD;
But taking his eyes off and keeping his eyes&#xD;
off the handsome swaggering4aoyden was not so&#xD;
easy-he disapproved of Harry from his soul-.-.&#xD;
he was sorely dissatisfied with himself at the&#xD;
anomaly of the very peculiarities he so thorough-&#xD;
ly condemned, attracting him most forcibly.&#xD;
Harry was the priest's niece-that was her pass-&#xD;
port into good society-otherwise she was poor,&#xD;
uneducated, r~'ther rude, but withal possessing&#xD;
a hearty, joyous, genial nature, that made her&#xD;
the soul of any frolic that was afoot.&#xD;
"You must excuse her, gentlemen! You must&#xD;
excuse her," said t~e priest, "she has never had&#xD;
the benefit of female culture, .and a single man, 1&#xD;
even a priest, is unfit to bring up a girl."&#xD;
"Well, then, uncle, that pr'~yes the evil of 1&#xD;
your clerical celibacy! You ought to have got&#xD;
married like an honest member of society, and&#xD;
then I should have been your daughter and not&#xD;
your niece !" speaking to the priest, but letting&#xD;
fly a couple of arrows from her dark eyes at I&#xD;
Colonel Lee Dangerfield. s&#xD;
The priest started, grew pale, looked search-&#xD;
ingly, steadily, severely into the face of his niece, t&#xD;
but Barry's eyes were dancing with those of ii&#xD;
Colonel Lee Dangerfield, and she seemed to have v&#xD;
forgotten her light words. A bitter, bitter t&#xD;
groan, suppressed at the lips, murmured deep a&#xD;
down the bosom of the old priest, and he fell o&#xD;
into a deep gloom. He checked Harry's rude- tl&#xD;
ness no morn~that morning.                 fi&#xD;
"Miss S&amp;amp;Irimerfield, of Red-Stone Hall, will v&#xD;
have to watch her betrothed," said Sina flinton, g&#xD;
to herself-Sina Hinton always spoke truth when a]&#xD;
she spoke to herself, and seldom at any other iv&#xD;
time; "and Herriette Joy is as much the niece t~&#xD;
of the priest as I am~the nephew of my mother! ti&#xD;
I have your secret, Father Burleigh, and that is fo&#xD;
another favorable point in my destiny-so much b&#xD;
for keeping my eyes open." . of&#xD;
Overflowing with exuberant life, Harry Joy th&#xD;
had whirligigged out of the piazza, and Col. pi&#xD;
Lee Dangerfield was about to follow, when the ~&#xD;
sound of carriage wheels were heard below, and&#xD;
soon the travelling chariot of Mrs. Summerfield ~1&#xD;
rolled slowly up the hill, approached and pause4 r~&#xD;

before the portico. The gentlemen present&#xD;
sprung down the steps to meet and assist the&#xD;
ladies from the carriage I Mrs. Summerfield&#xD;
came first-a tall, dark complexioned, and dig.&#xD;
unified woman, in the prime of life, and in the&#xD;
rich maturity of matronly beauty. She alighted&#xD;
and stepped forward with a Queen.like air of&#xD;
blended majesty and graciousness.&#xD;
"What a magnificent woman is Mrs. Sum.&#xD;
merfield !-a step like a reindeer's, a neck like&#xD;
a swan's, an eye like an eagle's, a mien&#xD;
like a monarch's! Heavens I-if I had a form&#xD;
and face like that, I could do what I pleased&#xD;
with it I-but Imogene-Miss Summerfield-the&#xD;
heiress I-let's see what she is like I" comment-&#xD;
ed Sine Hinton, as she watched the carriagedoer.&#xD;
Miss Suminerfield alighted, and passed quickly~&#xD;
through the hail, and entered the house-hel'&#xD;
figure muffled in a large black silk shawl; her&#xD;
face hidden by a black lace veil.&#xD;
'~ She is either ugly or very beautiful. She is&#xD;
either ashamed of her face, or she saves it for a&#xD;
dazzling effect In full dress,-now, which is it?&#xD;
They say she was beautiful when she left home&#xD;
for school-but girls change so much as they&#xD;
grow up, the ugly frequently growing handsome&#xD;
-the beautiful as often becoming plain. Wee&#xD;
ror her if she has not beauty enough to counter-&#xD;
charm the spell woven around the heart of her&#xD;
betrothed I This is a nice set of cross purposes&#xD;
is ever I saw! Col, Lee Dangerfield betrothe4&#xD;
o Miss Summerfield, and in love with Harry-&#xD;
whom he would never marry !-Harry passion-&#xD;
~tely in love with him-Winny Darling loving&#xD;
unconsciously, pensive Edgar Ardenne-Ardenne&#xD;
enamored of her I Satan has some use for me&#xD;
icre, I trow I-and it is a pity if I do not make&#xD;
something of this medley."&#xD;
All the guests were waiting impatiently for&#xD;
he breakfast-bell to ring, when they should&#xD;
neet at table the heiress of Red-Stone Hall, in&#xD;
rhose honor they were assembled. The innsk&#xD;
heir ears so thirsted for, at labt sounded on tho-&#xD;

company marched into the breakfast-room. At&#xD;
Ic head of the table appeared Mrs. Summer-.&#xD;
eld, who had changed her dress, but nowhere&#xD;
visible was the heiress. Mrs. Summeri~id&#xD;
raceflilly invited her guests to be seated, and&#xD;
polegized for the non-appearance of Miss 8am..&#xD;

"Miss Summerfield cannot have the pleasure&#xD;
of meeting her friends until the evening," replied&#xD;
the lady. And then the morning meal com-&#xD;
menced.&#xD;
It was a breakfast set out with magnificence-&#xD;
gold and silver plate, and Sevres China flashing&#xD;
in the light; and all the superabundant luxuries&#xD;
of the spot and season abounding. The finest&#xD;
milk,. cream, butter, and eggs, for the dairy and&#xD;
poultry-yards of Shannondale were unrivalled-&#xD;
fresh fish from the Shenandoah, game from the&#xD;
forest, and wild fowl from the air, &amp;amp;c., &amp;amp;c., &amp;amp;c.&#xD;
After breakfast the party formed for Lover's&#xD;
Leap. The horses were brought to the door.&#xD;
The party mounted, and cantered off down the&#xD;
hill to the river-a ferry-boat took them across&#xD;
-and they began to ascend the opposite moun-&#xD;
tain by a circuitous back path.&#xD;
Bina Hinton, contrary to her usual custom,&#xD;
kept near Miss Darling. "What a venerable&#xD;
looking man is Father Burleigh, my love," she&#xD;
~ ~.&amp;amp;id to Winny, "with his silver hair, and reve-&#xD;
rend countenance, he reminds me what St. Paul&#xD;
~.. might have been in his old age."&#xD;
"Yes! desr Father Burleigh! but I am so&#xD;
sorry that he is so infirm! What a pity It is&#xD;
that people we love should grow old and become&#xD;
infirm."&#xD;
"Ab, but he approaches a better and a hap-&#xD;
pier world," replied Miss Hinton, in the usual&#xD;
stereotyped words.&#xD;
"Yes, but we don't want any better or hap.&#xD;
:pier world than this. If the Lord would please&#xD;
to let us, I should like to live a hundred million&#xD;
~of centuries, on this very earth, with all my&#xD;
dear friends around me, and would never, never,&#xD;
ssver waht to see Heaven 1',&#xD;
"Oh, that is very wicked, my dear-but to re-&#xD;
- turn to Father Burleigh-he has been here a&#xD;
long time I"&#xD;
t' Fifty years last January, they say-he was&#xD;
here as sacristan first of all-then here he was&#xD;
- ordained, and he has lived here ever since."&#xD;
C'lium.m.-m," cooed Sina in a reverie-" well&#xD;
* -.-ah--.how long has his lovely niece been with&#xD;
~him ?"&#xD;
('Harry 7"&#xD;
" Of course-he has no other, has he ~&#xD;
"Oh! no! but then you called her 'lovely,'&#xD;
which was so funny; well, she has been with&#xD;
him ever since she was two years old-before I&#xD;
* nn ~&#xD;
"Yes! 'who is she? Where did she come&#xD;
front?"&#xD;
*" Well, she is the~daughter of his deceased&#xD;
sister or somebody, and he brought her from&#xD;
away down in Maryland somewhere."&#xD;
"Has Father Burleigh always remained here,&#xD;
and never been abroad?"&#xD;
Yes-once; he was away two years,&#xD;
on the Chesapeake near' the ol~tation of Mount&#xD;
'Carmel, in Marylaul~l. It was a year~ftp his&#xD;
&#xD;
return to this neighborhood, that he received a&#xD;
notice of his sister's death, and he went and&#xD;
fetched home her child, Rarriette, and he put&#xD;
her in charge of his housekeeper; she has been&#xD;
with him many years, and now keeps house for&#xD;
him."&#xD;
"Urn-rn-hum-rn," again murmured Sina; then&#xD;
she suddenly inquired-" How old is Father&#xD;
Burleigh? quite aged, isn't he 7"&#xD;
"Oh, yes I very, very, old-almost seventy."&#xD;
"Is it possible!" exclaimed Miss Hinton, with&#xD;
surprise.&#xD;
" Yes! is not tlsat old 7"&#xD;
Sina smiled.&#xD;
"Why, my dear, 1 supposed him to be eighty&#xD;
-he looks that. I could not make some&#xD;
things out either at that rate-but, my little&#xD;
love, how old is his niece?"&#xD;
"Harry Joy is twenty-five-but few take her&#xD;
to be so old; many people think her about&#xD;
twenty."&#xD;
"U-rn-rn-rn," replied Sina.&#xD;
I wish Icould give the reader an idea of the low,&#xD;
slow, cooing murmur with which that "U-in&#xD;
rn-me," was floated out. It was pue of Sina's&#xD;
fascinations-it expressed besides anaffirmative,&#xD;
love, sympathy, comfort, consolation-only Sina&#xD;
was so fond of it, that she used it it place, and&#xD;
as now, out of place-always instead of yes-&#xD;
like her undulating motion, it was a characteris.-&#xD;
tic of her.&#xD;
"You may ride on, now, love, and join Ar-&#xD;
denne, who is waiting for us at the summit. I&#xD;
must stop here to arrange my habit a little"-&#xD;
and Winny, without hesitation, ambled forward&#xD;
to join her tutor.&#xD;
The party dismounted at the summit of the&#xD;
mountain, and walked forward through a tangled&#xD;
thicket of stunted pines and cedars, and over~&#xD;
jagged rocks, to the front of the precipice, where&#xD;
the lover's rock ascended in a ,bold perpendicu-&#xD;
lar from the river. They seated themselves upon&#xD;
the fiat rocks upon its top, the priest occupying&#xD;
the central seat. The view from this summit&#xD;
was sublime, bordering upon the terrific. Be-&#xD;
hind them was the thicket of stunted pines and&#xD;
cedars that finding scant root arno~g the rocks,&#xD;
rowned the mountain. Before tii&amp;amp;a was the&#xD;
Fand amphitheatre of ~hannondaIe, encompassed&#xD;
on three sides with a crescent-shaped ridge of&#xD;
mountains-the centre of the crescent being&#xD;
Lover's Leap. Below them, at the distance of&#xD;
several hundred feet, rushed the rapid Shenan'-&#xD;
doah, filling up the pauses in the conversation&#xD;
with its roar; ~he vale rising from its banks&#xD;
rolled off in green undulations shaded with&#xD;
groves of trees, towards the forest in the back&#xD;
ground. Half way up the ascent stood old Red-&#xD;
Stone Hall, surrounded with its aged ancestral&#xD;
"Do not stand too near the edge of the preci-&#xD;
pice, Miss Barriette. It shelves over consider~&#xD;
&#xD;
ably. Do not look down, Miss Darling, you me&#xD;
grow giddy and fall," we~ e the warnings give]&#xD;
as the ladies arose to tak.- the views,&#xD;
lt was necessary to one,-Winny Darlin&#xD;
grew pale and reeled away from the edge ;-tb&#xD;
tutor caught her arm. lint Harry Joy, with&#xD;
glad, exultant spring, stood upon the extreme&#xD;
edge of the shelvingind frightful precipice, an&#xD;
throwing up her arms as if for a leap. Winn&#xD;
screamed. Harriette laughed, and sprung bad&#xD;
wards, again seating herself, and then Miss His&#xD;
ton, turning to the priest, said,&#xD;
"Now, Father, for the 'Legend of the Le&#xD;
ver's Leap.'"&#xD;
The old priest bowed himself to the company&#xD;
and began his tale.&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
THE LEGEND OF THE LOVER'S LEAP.&#xD;
Thus lived-thus died she ;-never more on her&#xD;
Shall sorrow light, or shame. She was not made&#xD;
Through years, or moons, the inner weight to bear,&#xD;
Which colder hearts endure till they are laid&#xD;
By age in earth; her days and pleasures were&#xD;
Brief, but delightful ;-such as had not stayed&#xD;
Long with her destiny ;-but she sleeps ~.rell&#xD;
Beneath the stream near which she loved to dwell.&#xD;
Byron.&#xD;
Manyvery many years ago, when this property&#xD;
was in the hands of Bushrod Summerfield, thi&#xD;
grandson of Lord Summerfield, the first settler&#xD;
there came to this part of the country a young&#xD;
Englishman of high rank, and ~f great wealth,&#xD;
He was a Colonel in the Hussars, from inclina-&#xD;
tion to a' martial life, rather than from the&#xD;
'necessity' of entering the profession. He is said&#xD;
to have ~bhen a very handsome man, of tall and&#xD;
commanding stature, with high Roman features,&#xD;
fired by the light of a falcon eye, and softened&#xD;
by an abundance of raven ringlets. His manner&#xD;
-his gestures-the tones of his voice possessed&#xD;
that marvellous fascination, that compelled the&#xD;
love-the adoration of all who knew him. Colo-&#xD;
nel Clinton had come out only to see the coun-&#xD;
try, at tbe invitation of Bushrod Summerfield,&#xD;
who, having been sent to England for educa&#xD;
tion, had formed an acquaintance with Clinton&#xD;
at Oxford.&#xD;
Of course, Colonel Clinton became the guest&#xD;
of Squire Surnmerfield. At this period, a rem-&#xD;
nant of the tribe of Shenandoah Indians dwelt&#xD;
on the other side of the mountains, with their&#xD;
wandering mode of life. They had a reserved&#xD;
privilege of fishing at a certain place in their&#xD;
own ancestral river. The head of this tribe&#xD;
was a woman-Lulu,'the daughter of the great&#xD;
chief, Worneo.at-akuk.&#xD;
"But I did not know that a wo~nan ever&#xD;
reigned over an Indlau tribe-'X *ho~igIit their&#xD;
&#xD;
y women were generally degraded," said Sina&#xD;
s, Hinton.&#xD;
"They are, generally, but not universally,&#xD;
g and not so much formerly as now. We see by&#xD;
e the chronicles of the early settlement of the&#xD;
a country, that the custom prevailed to some ex-&#xD;
e tent. Lulu was a grand, wild forest girl, of that&#xD;
d dark, rich, luxurious style of beauty never seen&#xD;
y in the most beautiful of the Caucasian race&#xD;
her form was tall and majestic, but beautifully&#xD;
proportioned-a small, but regal head, an arched&#xD;
and undulating neck, a fine, high breast,&#xD;
rounded limbs, tapering towards the delicate&#xD;
wrists and ankles, and small and elegantly she-&#xD;
ped feet and hands ;-such her form~ Her fea-&#xD;
tures were of the Jewess style-her complexion&#xD;
was dark, but singularly clear, and deepened&#xD;
into a rich crimson in the rounded cheeks and&#xD;
full and arched lips. Her eyes were large and&#xD;
dark, full of liquid fire-fierce and soft, as airger&#xD;
or tenderness possessed her; her eyebrows were&#xD;
very black and heavy, her eyelashes long, thick 4&#xD;
and black, and her hair rolled in shining waves&#xD;
of purplish black nearly to her feet She usually&#xD;
wore a superb dress of fine scarlet cloth, richly&#xD;
and beautifully embroidered with various colored&#xD;
beads, silks, and gold and silver threads, end&#xD;
fringed with variegated feathers. Her dress&#xD;
was short, and confined to her waist by a belt,&#xD;
in which were stuck one or two elegantly.&#xD;
wrought poignards, (purchased from the white&#xD;
settlers.) Her neck, arms and legs were bere;&#xD;
three or four rov~s of bright beads decked her&#xD;
throat, and heavy gold and silver bracelets en..&#xD;
circled her wrists and ankles. Her purplish&#xD;
lockS, twined with many a gem, hung far below&#xD;
her waist. The fame of the wondrous beauty&#xD;
of the Queen of the Shenandoahs had gone all&#xD;
over the whole settlement; and by the braves of&#xD;
her own tribe, the beautiful Lulu was loved,&#xD;
adored, worshipped as a goddess, with all the&#xD;
wild enthusiasm of savage idolatry. Her hand&#xD;
had been' sought 'in marriage by the chiefs of&#xD;
other tribes, but Lulu had never felt a throb of&#xD;
love. She seemed something set apar~'and sa-&#xD;
cred,-the vestal Queen rejected all these offers,&#xD;
with proud and high disdain. -&#xD;
One day there was a great hunt upon the moun-&#xD;
tains; Squire Summerfield and Colonel Clinton&#xD;
I joinedinit. The foxafterrunningacircuitofthfr..&#xD;
ty miles, closely pursued by the hounds and hue--&#xD;
tore, of whom the gallant Colonel Clinton was'the.&#xD;
foremost, fled towards the river,.-.took this diree-~&#xD;
tion throughthethicket, straight to this precipice,,&#xD;
madly followed by Colonel Clinton, on his spi-&#xD;
rited horse. The fox sprang to the edge of the&#xD;
precipice, paused, took breath, gave one fearful&#xD;
look around, when Colonel Clinton, pn his fiery&#xD;
Ilorse, came thundering on, and took th~ leap-&#xD;
the fierce horse of the hunter, in the deIlkn~ni;&#xD;
the'vt~se, sped *adly on, and sprang overj&#xD;

14                             SHANN(&#xD;
p.4 short at the brink of the precipice, and now&#xD;
they set up a fearful wail. Other hunters rode&#xD;
up, but seeing no signs of a catastrophe, suspect-&#xD;
ed none, supposing that Colonel Clinton had, upon&#xD;
losing the quarry, taken another road.&#xD;
Colonel Clinton's brain had reeled and he had&#xD;
lost his senses at the moment the fearful leap&#xD;
was taken-when he recovered them he found&#xD;
himself lying on a pallet of delicate furs, in a tent&#xD;
hung on the inside with fine yellow cloth richly&#xD;
embroidered with silver thread. The setting&#xD;
sun was pouring a flood of golden light through&#xD;
the opening into the tent, which bathed the dark,&#xD;
bright, glorious form of the Indian queen who&#xD;
stood in its full blaze. Colonel Clinton strove to&#xD;
collect his thoughts. It was some time before&#xD;
he could recollect what had happened. At last&#xD;
he did; and then beckoning to the dark beauty,&#xD;
who immediately approached him, he said-&#xD;
"I know what has occurred. I guess where I&#xD;
am-but-by what miracle was I saved I"&#xD;
The Queen of the Shenandoahs replied in bro-&#xD;
ken English-" broken music"-that her braves&#xD;
were out upon the river in their canoes fishing-&#xD;
that they had seen the fatal leap-that the horse&#xD;
was dashed to pieces at the foot of the precipice,&#xD;
but that Ins had been eataght between the strong&#xD;
forks of a projecting tree a few feet from the&#xD;
summit-that, her braves had climbed the rock,&#xD;
rescued him, and brought him to their encamp-&#xD;
ment. Clinton tound that both his arms had been&#xD;
broken by the fall, but that they were set, splin-&#xD;
tered, and bound up with great skill, also, that his&#xD;
body was severely bruised. But Clinton thought&#xD;
*not of his wounds and bruises-his whole soul was&#xD;
flooded with an excess of glory and of beauty&#xD;
that he could scarcely bear and live-languid,&#xD;
prostrate and helpless as he was, the approach&#xD;
of the dark, bright, luxurious Indian beauty,&#xD;
threw all his senses into a delirium of excite-&#xD;
ment that threatened the stability of his reason.&#xD;
He recovered rapidly, but he had no wish to quit&#xD;
his quarters. Heedless of the anxieties of his&#xD;
friends, he avoided informing them of his where-&#xD;
abouts, lest they should disturb him in his delici-&#xD;
ous life of blended ecsttrcy and anguish. You&#xD;
will anticipate the result. He, with his glorious&#xD;
beauty, grace and eloquence wooed and won the&#xD;
fierce and beautiful forest queen.&#xD;
Ah, tlie tigress grew as gentle as the doe-the&#xD;
queen became the slave! Her warriors saw with&#xD;
a fierce and bitter jealousy the growing weak-&#xD;
ness of their queen-the discrowning of their&#xD;
goddess. They assembled round their council&#xD;
* fires and talked-they went to her and expostu-&#xD;
lated-in vain! in vain! She did not heed or&#xD;
even hear them! her soul was absorbed in one&#xD;
idea-one life! her senses all bound up in one&#xD;
ecstatic trance! They met again in council, and&#xD;
* after a deliberate, long talk they decided that the&#xD;
white intruder should leave their encampment&#xD;
~ twenty-four hours at the peril *f his life.&#xD;
&#xD;
)NDALE.&#xD;
This decision was conveyed to Clinton the same&#xD;
evening. He assente&amp;amp;very calmly. And she!&#xD;
she left her Indian crown-she left her glorious&#xD;
heritage of independence, of love, of worship,&#xD;
and of power, and followed like a slave the&#xD;
foot-steps of her chosen master when he bade&#xD;
her follow! A hut in the depths of the forest&#xD;
received the English officer and his Indian mis-&#xD;
tress. He supplied his wants and hers by hunt-&#xD;
ing and fishing. She cooked his meals apd serv-&#xD;
ed him fondly. This you know could not last&#xD;
long-the highly educated, highly accomplished,&#xD;
elegant and fastidious Reginald Clinton, the&#xD;
flower of the young English aristocracy, could&#xD;
not long content himself with a savage, however&#xD;
attractive she might be. After the first ecstatic&#xD;
shock sent to his heart by her dark electric beauty&#xD;
had subsided, his passion waned. And after he&#xD;
had ceased to love her, her very tenderness, hu-&#xD;
mility and submission only disgusted and revolt-&#xD;
ed him; he determined to leave her. Reginald&#xD;
Clinton had nil a fine gentleman's abhorrence of&#xD;
"a scene." He resolved to evade one, so one&#xD;
day he took leave of Luin as if for a day of hunt-&#xD;
log, and he never saw her but once more. He&#xD;
turned his steps towards Shannondale, where he&#xD;
arrived late in the afternoon. Squire Summer-&#xD;
field received him with surprise and joy as one&#xD;
from the dead. He told them the story of his&#xD;
rescue by the Indians and of his sojourn, among&#xD;
them-but he said nothing of [~ulu. Squire Sum-&#xD;
merfield introduced him to his young sister, Rose&#xD;
Summerfield, for her exceeding beauty called the&#xD;
"Rose of Shannondale." She had just returned&#xD;
from France where she had been educated, and&#xD;
had arrived at Red Stone Hall during the absence&#xD;
of Colonel Clinton. Very lovely was the Rose&#xD;
of Shannondale-with her hebe-like style of&#xD;
beauty, her exquisite form, her fair complexion,&#xD;
with its sudden blushes-her deep blue eyes,&#xD;
with their' meek droop, and the clustering auburn&#xD;
tendrils that contrasted so brightly with her&#xD;
snowy forehead and roseate cheeks. Clinton&#xD;
was thrown constantly in her society, and he&#xD;
found her mind and heart richly cultivated and&#xD;
beautiful as her person. He loved her-not&#xD;
with that passionate delirium of attraction that&#xD;
had bound him to Luiu; but with a profound and&#xD;
tender affection founded upon deep esteem; and&#xD;
an affection that might have possessed redeem-&#xD;
ing power for him but for his sins against Lulu.&#xD;
A few weeks passed and Reginald Clinton was&#xD;
the accepted lover of Rose Summerfield, and&#xD;
their marriage day was fixed. Splendid prt~pa.&#xD;
rations were made. The fame of the magnifi-&#xD;
cence, of the approaching bridal spread all ever&#xD;
the country. A vast number of relatives and&#xD;
friends were invited. The marriage day came.&#xD;
Evening drew on. The guests assembled.-&#xD;
Night was turned to day with the splendor of th~&#xD;
iiluminations. The marriage ceremony was over&#xD;
and the company were all in the saloon. Many&#xD;

16              SHANNONDALE-&#xD;
&#xD;
There were about two hundred guests ezpect-&#xD;
3d, and as the shades of night fell, they began to&#xD;
arrive.&#xD;
The whole front of the hall was one sheet of&#xD;
illnmination-the whole extent of the lwwn a&#xD;
grove of carriages. Numerous grooms, coach-&#xD;
men, and other servants and attendants of the&#xD;
visitors, filled up the piazzas and the passages.&#xD;
The great saloon was thrown open-a magnifi-&#xD;
cent spectacle! The dark and polished oak of&#xD;
the paunelled wall, relieved by large and costly&#xD;
paintings of old artists, all of a character at&#xD;
once scriptural and festal-as "The Feast of&#xD;
the Tabernacle," "The Marriage of Cana,"&#xD;
"David Dancing Before the Ark of God,"&#xD;
"The Prodigal Son's Festival," &amp;amp;c. These&#xD;
pictures were large a.s life-three on each side&#xD;
of the room-and garlanded with festoons of&#xD;
flowers. The spaces between them were filled&#xD;
up alternately with statues, holding immense&#xD;
wax candles, and immense vases, filled with&#xD;
flowers. The curtains at the windows, the&#xD;
sofa, ottoman,~'and chair-covers, were all of rich&#xD;
purple damask, fringed with gold. A gallery at&#xD;
upper end of the saloon held the band.&#xD;
A central chandelier, with a thousand pendant&#xD;
crystals, hanging from the ceiling, poured down&#xD;
a shower of various-colored light, filling the&#xD;
vast saloon with radiance. At the, appointed&#xD;
hour of reception, the doors were thrown open,&#xD;
and the band struck up a fine, inspiring strain of&#xD;
music. The saloon soon began to fill. It was&#xD;
whispered about that the "Three Belles of Shan-&#xD;
nondale" were to be present. Two of them&#xD;
were seated side by side on one of the short&#xD;
sofas. A perfect contrast were these two beau-&#xD;
ties-Harry and Winny. Harry, with her wick-&#xD;
ed black eyes, and her clustering curls, kinking&#xD;
like grape-tendrils, in short, spiral, glistening&#xD;
black ringlets around her broad, white, boyish&#xD;
brow-Harry, with her richly mantling, bright&#xD;
carnation bloom, and her saucy arched lips, and&#xD;
arrayed in her showy dress of blue and gold&#xD;
changeable satin, and frisking her saucy fan,-&#xD;
and Winny, with her soft, dark-blue, tender&#xD;
eyes, and her long, smooth, pale gold ringlets,&#xD;
drooping down her fair forehead and delicate&#xD;
peach-blossom cheeks-Winny, with her simple&#xD;
white silk dress, and little p~sey of pinks.&#xD;
Winny had no fan-she said that Harry Joy&#xD;
raised wind Onough for them both. Near them&#xD;
stood the queen of the festival-the beauty and&#xD;
the heiress-Imogene Summerfield-receiving&#xD;
her company. She was supported on one side&#xD;
by the presence of her mother; on th~ other, by&#xD;
that of her betrothed husband.&#xD;
Imogene Snmme;field!-how shall I describe&#xD;
her wondrous, her divine beauty? 1 feel that&#xD;
my steps are on holy ground as I approach her.&#xD;
Her form was above the middle height, ele-&#xD;
gantly proportioned, and arrayed in a richly&#xD;
embroidered black lace robe, worn over White&#xD;
&#xD;
satin. The effect of this dress was singularly&#xD;
beautiful. She wore no ornament, except her&#xD;
own long, black, splendid hair, that fell in three&#xD;
divisions of massive ringlets, far below her&#xD;
waist: one down her shoulders, behind, and two&#xD;
brought forward, and flowing down in waves of&#xD;
jet each side of her bosom. Her forehead was&#xD;
high and fair; her eye-brows black; slender, and&#xD;
arched; her eye-lashes black, long, and thiek-4&#xD;
but her eyes-her large, dark, glorious eyes I-&#xD;
so profound in their interminable depths of&#xD;
meaning I-inlets to an unfathomable spirit-&#xD;
world within. She received her guests with a&#xD;
native grace and dignity; yet withal, a halt ab-&#xD;
stracted air-as she r!~sed her long eye-lashes,&#xD;
the light slowly returned to her shadowy eyes,&#xD;
as though the spirit was recalled from a distance.&#xD;
"And her smile it seemed half holy,&#xD;
As if drawn from thoughts more rare&#xD;
Than ourcorumon jestings are"&#xD;
There was something of reverence in the&#xD;
admiration she insp~red. There was some-&#xD;
thing of veneration even in the tone and manner&#xD;
of her dignified and gracious mother, as she ad-&#xD;
dressed her. She did not dance. You could not&#xD;
imagine her taking part in the lively cotiions-&#xD;
she did not dance-but when the solemn, half&#xD;
martial, half dirge-like march of the minuet was&#xD;
played, then, at the earnest request of Colonel&#xD;
Dangerfield, seconded by her mother, she gave&#xD;
him her hand to walk the stately minuet. A&#xD;
suppressed murmur of admiration, mingled with&#xD;
awe, floated around the room as the queenly&#xD;
form of Miss Summerfield sailed on in the ma-&#xD;
jestic measure. Colonel Pangerfield, also, hand-&#xD;
some and gallant-looking in his superb uniform,&#xD;
received his share of admiration from the ladies.&#xD;
At the termination of the august dance, Coloup~&#xD;
Dangerfield, with a suave and stately courtesy~&#xD;
conducted his partner back to her seat, ~owed&#xD;
profoundly, and remained standing by her side.&#xD;
Miss Summerfield did not dance again, nor did&#xD;
Colonel Dangerfield leave her side again that&#xD;
evening, though from time to time his attention&#xD;
was distracted by the musical laughter or the&#xD;
merry looks of Harry Joy.&#xD;
Quadrilles again followed the minuet, and&#xD;
Harry Joy bore off the palm in that lively mea-&#xD;
sure.&#xD;
"Her feet beat witchcraft as sne led the dance."&#xD;
Waltzing succeeded, and Winny Darling excel-&#xD;
led in that charming, half caressing whirl.-&#xD;
Many people were surprised that Miss Darling&#xD;
waltzed-a young lady carefully reared as she&#xD;
had been by her grandmother-but Winny was&#xD;
entirely tee pure-minded to dream that any one&#xD;
saw hitrm in waltzing. She waltzed with her&#xD;
tutor only.&#xD;

them,                                     and were dismounting at the very instant that&#xD;
"The time is ripe," she said, and she resolved Squire Darling seizing both the hands of Harry,&#xD;
to inform against them that very day.     said,&#xD;

~' Miss Hinton and Mr. Ardenne you are both&#xD;
welcome back! I am glad to see you!"&#xD;
'tue whole party retired to change their dress&#xD;
for dinner.&#xD;
Squire Darling followed, with a crotchet in his&#xD;
head. There was a little vein of romance in the&#xD;
broad strata of benevolence in his composition.&#xD;
This sometimes led him to jump to conclusions,&#xD;
not always correct. Miss Hinton and Mr. Ar-&#xD;
denne happened to be conversing in a very conil-&#xD;
dential strain when they rode up together; when&#xD;
they dismounted, Winny, as has been seen, had&#xD;
run forward to meet her father, and Mr. Ardenne&#xD;
had given his arm up the steps to Sins, and they&#xD;
continued their confidential talk until Squire&#xD;
Darling turned to them. Now Squire Darling&#xD;
had noticed this, and imagined there was a&#xD;
love affair existing between the tutor and the&#xD;
companion! He liked this! this suited him! it&#xD;
assimilated with the warm geniality and hon&#xD;
hommie of his temper-it seemed to him very&#xD;
proper and fitting. Sina is a frank, sincere,&#xD;
brave girl, and Ardenne is a most estimable&#xD;
youth; poor things! I dare say now they are&#xD;
looking forward to many, many years of waiting&#xD;
before they think they can marry-they are so&#xD;
destitute! but it shall not be so; I will be their&#xD;
providence; I will set him up in business, and&#xD;
they shall be married as soon as they please;&#xD;
for, by St. Peter, life is too short to be passed in&#xD;
waiting! but I must see mother first about it."&#xD;
And as the visitors were all in their private&#xD;
apartments preparing for dinner, the squire&#xD;
having an hour of relaxation from hospitable&#xD;
duties, went to see his mother in her room up&#xD;
stairs. He found the old lady deep in the perusal&#xD;
of the "Mysteries of Udoipho." Madam Wini-&#xD;
fred was a tall, thin, wasted old lady, with a&#xD;
long, pale, tbin face, with a mild expression.-&#xD;
Sne wore a black silk dress, with a white mus-&#xD;
lin inside handkerchief folded over her bosom,&#xD;
and a white muslin cap, beneath which her sil-&#xD;
ver hair was parted neatly over her brow. She&#xD;
looked so clean, pure, gentle and dignified. It&#xD;
was the dignity of age and goodness rathe'i than&#xD;
of pride, or even of wisdom. The old lady was&#xD;
a devoted Christian, though a bigoted Catholic;&#xD;
and now at sixty.five she was as full of romance&#xD;
as her grand-daughter of sixteen; yet it was the&#xD;
high toned and elevating chivalry of romance&#xD;
akin to religion, and it is to be presumed that it&#xD;
was from her the squire derived the romantic&#xD;
alloy in the pure gold of his own sound nature. I&#xD;
have before mentioned the perfect family har-&#xD;
mony and unity that existed between the houses&#xD;
of Oak Grove and Red-Stone; I will now in-&#xD;
form you that the love and confidence between&#xD;
this mother and son were perfect.&#xD;
"Good-morning, dear mother, what have you&#xD;
got there1~&#xD;
"A very interesting new novel from the pen&#xD;
of Mrs. Radclxft, my son. My grand-daughter,&#xD;
&#xD;
ND ALL.&#xD;
Imogene, who never forgets mebrought it down&#xD;
from ~ieorgetown, for me."&#xD;
"Yes, ma'am. Mother! I have found out a&#xD;
nice little romance in real life! Love is always&#xD;
a romance, ha! mother? and when its happy&#xD;
consummation is almost hopeless, it is a deep ro-&#xD;
mance-is it not, mother ?"&#xD;
"I hope you do not refer to eit~.r of ipy&#xD;
arand-daughters, Miss Summerfield or Miss Dar.&#xD;
ling, my son ?" said the old lady, her mild, blue&#xD;
eyes looking very solemnly over her spectacles.&#xD;
Winny! pooh! Winny's a baby, in love with&#xD;
milk and bread! As for Miss Summertield-for&#xD;
by my life I never feel familiar enough with my&#xD;
niece to call her Imogene-as for Miss Scm-&#xD;
merfield, she is enamoured of an arch-angel&#xD;
in the seventh heavers, perhaps! No, I speak&#xD;
of Sina and the tutor-they love each other,&#xD;
poor children, and they can never marry unless&#xD;
we help them."&#xD;
"How help them?" inquired Madam Winifred,&#xD;
whom this news did not by any means startle,&#xD;
she having foreseen it. "How can we further&#xD;
the wishes of the poor young lovers?&#xD;
"'Money makes the mule go'-there is&#xD;
scarcely an enterprise in this world that money&#xD;
will not forward; scarcely an evil in this world&#xD;
that money will not avdrt-scarcely a g d on&#xD;
this earth, that money will not obtain."&#xD;
"More the pity that we should       the&#xD;
slaves of lucre," said the old lady.&#xD;
"Yet, God forgive my levity!" said ire,&#xD;
with one of his sudden changes from lightness to&#xD;
solemnity -" May lied forgive my levity.&#xD;
there was one evil, that money could not avert&#xD;
-cannot cure! the loss of my adored wife; and&#xD;
there is one good-one God-given good-the&#xD;
possession of my darling, my blessed, my ido-&#xD;
lized child! my love-angel Winny !" said the&#xD;
father, with deep emotion.&#xD;
Ah! Squire Darling, mone2,1 did not purchase&#xD;
your treasure, nor can the want of money de-&#xD;
prive you of her. But-the pride of birth-the&#xD;
pride of rank-the pride of wealth-the inso-&#xD;
lence of power-the selfishness of love-the&#xD;
vengeance of jealousy-these will banish your&#xD;
love-angel from you!&#xD;
"Yes, you wrong your better nature, when&#xD;
you speak so lightly, my dear son. But what do&#xD;
you intend to do in the premises."&#xD;
"I intend to have an interview with Sina this&#xD;
very day. I should rather break the subject to&#xD;
her than to Ardenne; confound the fellow, there~&#xD;
is a dark, dangerous majesty of manner .:about&#xD;

safe-she is a free, frank, sincere girl; too sin-&#xD;

SINA HINTON.&#xD;
"la face an angel, but is soul a cat."&#xD;
Wolcott.&#xD;
Sina, as we have said, fled about the house&#xD;
like a scared cat, as she was, and finally found&#xD;
Ardenne reading "The Lady of the Lake" to&#xD;
Miss Darling, in the piazza. She sprang t, his&#xD;
side-she seized his elbow.&#xD;
"Come! come with . me -into one of the&#xD;
distant arbors-I must-I MusT have an in-&#xD;
terview with you immediately. Nay, Winny,&#xD;
stay where you are," and she drew Ardenne&#xD;
away, who followed her with an amazed air.&#xD;
When they reached the arbor-" All is lost!"&#xD;
she said, "all! all is lost Oh, Ardenne, for-&#xD;

This was a deep stroke of art on the part of&#xD;
Sina. At the electric words "Your wife," the&#xD;
young man grew pale and reeled with excess&#xD;
of pleasure. "Wife." What a magic word.&#xD;

He led her into the dining-room, and plac&#xD;
her at table, where the rest of the comnpa:&#xD;
were already assembled. Winny was ther&#xD;
looking pale and -anxious, yet uncertain ni&#xD;
mystified, as if she felt the storm in the air, bi&#xD;
could not see from what point the cloud arose.&#xD;
Ardenne was the last to enter; placing tI&#xD;
bouquet in a flower-stand until it might be wan&#xD;
ed, he took his accustomed seat at the board.-&#xD;
rhe squire greeted him with an excess of cou:&#xD;
tesy, amounting to insult Ardenne, as ti&#xD;
tutor, gave precedence to all the gentlemen c&#xD;

nearest that of the squire, who presided at fti&#xD;

"1 have been seeking you, sir," he said.&#xD;
"I am at your command, sir," replied Ai&#xD;

"I am advised of the honor you intend me !~&#xD;

Ardenne bowed with grave and stately con:&#xD;
tesy in reply, and the squire, somewhat modifie&#xD;
by his manner, or recollecting himself as a Vi:&#xD;

bow, and gave his attention to other things.-&#xD;

precedence to all the ladies of the party, an&#xD;
taken the lowest seat on her side-across th&#xD;

"Leave the table, Miss Darling !" saidher&#xD;
father, with a severe frown, hut in a low tone-&#xD;
gr~atily fearing that her agitation would draw&#xD;
enrion, and dreading a scene. Winny, tram-&#xD;
hung, arose aiid left the table. Ardenne arose&#xD;
with a fierce but steady gaze into the eyes of the&#xD;
squire, and followed her.&#xD;
"What is the matter ?" inquired Madam Wini-&#xD;
fred.&#xD;
"Nothing! nothing! but that Miss ~Darling&#xD;
has turned a little giddy," said the squire, and&#xD;
then to himself he said, "Very well, young man!&#xD;

she said-" Listen, Edgar: When we separate&#xD;

"Death and d-n, sir I she loves you no.1!-&#xD;

self-control--all sense of decency and propriety,&#xD;
the squire lroke forth into the most violent and&#xD;
shameful torrent of invective and abuse-and&#xD;
concluded by thundering,&#xD;
"Get out of my house, sir? or by all that's&#xD;
holy, I sj~sIl kick you out I,'&#xD;
Livid with the rage suppressed for Winny's&#xD;
sake, the young man turned and left the study,&#xD;
and soon after left the house. The squire sank&#xD;
down into his chair, and wiped and wiped again&#xD;
the perspiration from his brow, his heart throb-&#xD;
bing as if it would choke him. This loss, this&#xD;
utter loss of all self~command, had been what the&#xD;
squire had tried to guard against all day- -this&#xD;
was the reason why he had not followed Ardenne&#xD;
immediately when the latter arose and went&#xD;
after Winny from the dinner table. In his first&#xD;
interview with Sina Hinton, the surprise, the&#xD;
violence of the shock his feelings had received,&#xD;
had thrown him off his guard, and he had given&#xD;
way to the phrenzy of anger. When that was&#xD;
past, though still in a deep rage, he resolved to&#xD;
guard against its breaking out into fury and&#xD;
alarming his guests; for, as I said, the squire&#xD;
had all the instincts of the gentleman and the&#xD;
hostbut theopenupright frankness, which he call-&#xD;
- ad the "cool impudence," of Ardenne, had dri-&#xD;
van him mad. Now he satwith his light hair stick-&#xD;
lug stragglingly out in every direction, with his&#xD;
blue eyes contracted, isis fair, red face streaming&#xD;
with perspiration, his fat knees apart, and hold-&#xD;
ing a large straw haE with both hands, as he&#xD;
fanned himself. After a little, he got up and&#xD;
rung the bell. A s nt answered it.&#xD;
"Send Miss HinfZi 'ito. me, sink it 1-go and&#xD;
say to Miss Hinten tWat I beg the favor of her&#xD;
presence for a few minutes in this study."&#xD;
The servant left the room. In an instant after,&#xD;
Sina glided in.&#xD;
"Sit down, Miss Hinton 1-sit down, my dear?&#xD;
I have sent the young rascal about his business,&#xD;
my dear I"&#xD;
if Alas, sir, frie ly as I feel towards him,"&#xD;
said Sins, putting er handkerchief to her face,&#xD;
"I must admit that his expulsion was well de-&#xD;
served 1"&#xD;
"I reckon it was I The insolent fellow had&#xD;
the impudence to ask my permission to marry&#xD;
my daughter I Now, that was a great deal&#xD;
more assuming and presumn~ than if he had&#xD;
tried to elope with her," sa squire, wiping&#xD;
his face and furiously fanning imselt. "Ah,&#xD;
talking of elopements, where is that poor little&#xD;
angel-I mean that wicked little daughter of&#xD;
mine ?"&#xD;
'~'I carried her to my room, because it was&#xD;
nearest, sir-she is lying on my bed."&#xD;
"Ab I go lock the door !-...go at once, Miss&#xD;
Hinton-lock the door, and always keep the&#xD;
key yourself; she shall be in yourcharge; when&#xD;
&#xD;
ON PA LE~&#xD;
she wishes to come out, do not leave her side a&#xD;
moment !"&#xD;
Now, at first thought, Sina did not like this&#xD;
being constituted Winny's jailor, but a mo-&#xD;
ment's reflection taught her. that this was the&#xD;
very way in which she would be best able to&#xD;
assist the intercoufee of the lovers, and forward&#xD;
her own plans. She curtsied and withdrew from&#xD;
the study to obey the command. She went to&#xD;
her room, and found Winny still lying on the&#xD;
bed, with her hands pressed over her face, ann&#xD;
the tears stealing through her fingers. Sina&#xD;
stooped over her, kissed her tenderly, and whiz-&#xD;
pered softly,&#xD;
"Winny, my dear love, your father-.-your&#xD;
stern, harsh father-has commanded me to lock&#xD;
you in; have faith in me, Winny, have faith in&#xD;
me, dear child, and by seeming your jailor, 1&#xD;
shall be your friend and assistant. You shall&#xD;
see your lover to-night," and the girl-..and&#xD;
double traitress - doubly, trebly steeped ma&#xD;
falsehood, locked the door and returned to the&#xD;
study.&#xD;
"Ahi very well-very well, indeed I" said&#xD;
the squire, when he saw the key. "Now, Miss&#xD;
Hinton, is the young villain-the Black Prince&#xD;
-gone ?"&#xD;
"I heard a servant say that he had taken his&#xD;
departure, sir, and that he had left directions&#xD;
to have his baggage forwarded to Harper's&#xD;
Ferry."&#xD;
"Very well, it shall be done-Miss Hinton 1"&#xD;
"Sir I"&#xD;
"You are a very pretty girl; give me a kiss."&#xD;
"1 am a very plain, poor girl, sir, with no&#xD;
dower but my discretion."&#xD;
"And a very good dower-and by lleavenyou&#xD;
shall have a better one," said the squire.&#xD;
"1 offer you my duty, sir; have you any far-.&#xD;
ther commands for me ?"&#xD;
"No-yes! no-that is to say, I have a ques-&#xD;
tion to ask. Has this disagreeable affair got&#xD;
wind among the visitors yet ?"&#xD;
"Not at all, sir. Mrs. and Miss Summerfield&#xD;
are in their chambers, in a remote part of the&#xD;
house-and Colonel Dangerfield is out shooting&#xD;
with Harry Joy, and Father Burleigh has gone&#xD;
to marry a couple."&#xD;
"D-n 'marrying a couple'-it's all non-&#xD;
sense I"&#xD;
"Anything more, sir ?"&#xD;
"No! be off with you? you little prude; you&#xD;
only stay here to worry me."&#xD;
And Sina Hiuton curtsied~and glided from the&#xD;
room with a singular smile on her lips.&#xD;
Sina met the priest as he came in from his&#xD;
mission. "Good evening, Father Burleigh,"&#xD;
she said, and hastened to take his staff and hat,&#xD;
and put them upon the rack-and to offer him a&#xD;
chair in the coolest ps~f the piazza. "1 can-.&#xD;
not think where Harr be," said she, leaning&#xD;
over the balustrade and pretending to be looking&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
SIIANNO&#xD;
eagerly out-then returning, she sea ccl tit~&#xD;
near the priest and said, in her insinuating tones,&#xD;
"What a charming girl your niece is, Father&#xD;
Burleigh-such a remarkable style of beauty,&#xD;
too-such a fine expanded white brow; does she&#xD;
resemble her mother?" and Sina fixed her eyes on&#xD;
his eyes, and slowly sent their glances deep into&#xD;
his very soul. "Say, Father Burleigh, doeb she&#xD;
resemble her mother ?"&#xD;
The priest grew very pale, and trembled.&#xD;
"On!" said Sina, with a look of deep repen-&#xD;
tance, "perhaps you loved her mother very&#xD;
much-and grieved very much over her death-&#xD;
and I, indiscreet girl, have opened again the long&#xD;
closed wound. I am deeply grieved."&#xD;
The priest arose, tottered, grasped the chair&#xD;
and sank back into it. Sina ran and got a glass&#xD;
of water-gave it to him with the softest words&#xD;
of sympathy and condolence, while her eye fixed&#xD;
triumphantly, maliciously upon his, said,&#xD;
"I have the deepest secret of your soul-you&#xD;
are henceforth my slave. You have unbounded&#xD;
or almost unbounded power over your p~rssh-&#xD;
loners, over the families especially of Oak Grove&#xD;
'and of Red-Stone! You shall use it as I direct."&#xD;
And havirtg driven this stake, she went to her&#xD;
room-and in a disguised hand wrote the follow-&#xD;
ing short note to Edgar Ardenne:&#xD;
--.-" Your loved one is in the last, the very&#xD;
last extremity-she lies like a 'bower beaten&#xD;
down by the storm; nothing but your presence&#xD;
will revive her-nothing but your presence this&#xD;
evening, will give her strength to bear the few&#xD;
days separation that must intervene between&#xD;
this and your marriage. Be, at ten this evening,&#xD;
at the place where we talked together this morn-&#xD;
ing, and I will conduct you to her.&#xD;
"In haste and in peril,&#xD;
"You know who."&#xD;
It will be observed, that in this cautious note,&#xD;
there was neither name, date, locality, or any&#xD;
sufficiently distinct allusion to betray her, even if&#xD;
as a remote possibility it should fall into other&#xD;
hands than those intended to receive it. Be-&#xD;
sides, the hand was an imitation of that of ano-&#xD;
ther member of the family. While Sina sealed&#xD;
this letter she looked at Winny- Winny was&#xD;
lying on the bed very quiet, with her face half&#xD;
b~iried in the pillow-apparently, perhaps really&#xD;
unconscious of the presence of any one else in the&#xD;
apartment.&#xD;
Sina elided from the room, down stairs and&#xD;
slipped the letter in the post-bag just as it was&#xD;
about to be carried off. "So far, so good! he&#xD;
must think it necessary to carry Winny off to&#xD;
save her life! Now for Winny, she must be&#xD;
made to believe it essential to the continuance of&#xD;
his existence, to be carried off by him." And&#xD;
Sine returned to her room, where Winny still&#xD;
lay~ She went up to the side of the bed-stoop-&#xD;
ed over Winny, laid her hand gently on the&#xD;

ts~rob'ing young head, drew aside the golden&#xD;
ringlets that clung damp to her temples, kissed&#xD;
her tenderly, and murmured, in her soft melliflu-&#xD;
ous tone-&#xD;
'~Look up, my love; my love-sister look up&#xD;
and tell me how you are.~~&#xD;
Winny's white arms arose from the bed and&#xD;
drew the head of Sina down to hers in silence.&#xD;
Sina sat upon the side of the bed, nestled to her,&#xD;
raised her up, and laid her fair head upon~'1ier&#xD;
bosom, stroking her golden ringlets, kissingher,&#xD;
and cooing comfort all the while.&#xD;
"Sinai what passed between-between fa-&#xD;
ther and-and him I"&#xD;
"My dear Winny! my little love, it is best&#xD;
you should not know I" said the artful girl, with&#xD;
a look o~ solemn meaning.&#xD;
This of course terrified the poor child. and&#xD;
stimulated her to fresh and urgent iuquiry-.-.-aa&#xD;
it was intended to do.&#xD;
"Oh, tell me! tell me, dearest Sinai"&#xD;
"My love! my little darling-it would only&#xD;
make you more miserable-do not ask me I"&#xD;
Winny turned deadly sick with fear, and&#xD;
would have fainted but for the mental stimulus&#xD;
of her keen anxiety.&#xD;
~' This dread is worse tuna certainty-tell&#xD;
mc I" faltered the white and trembling child.&#xD;
"Well, then, dear child, it you must have it,&#xD;
I will tell you. I happened to be in the pas-&#xD;
sage leading to the study- he - your -father,&#xD;
I mean, talked loud, and I could not help&#xD;
hearing him. Edgar, like an honorable, high&#xD;
should man as he is, did not seek to conceal any~&#xD;
things he avowed his love for you; admitted&#xD;
that he had nothing but a cabin and a life of in-.&#xD;
dastry and frugality to share with you, and-"&#xD;
"And oh! if father were willing! it Would be&#xD;
such a heaven to share that poverty! Oh, it&#xD;
would be a divine joy to work and to bear pain&#xD;
for Edgar," said Winny, clasping her little white&#xD;
hands in a sort of ecstasy.&#xD;
"Tne inconceivable little idiot! ' thought Sina&#xD;
to herself.&#xD;
"Well, well! what said father, Sina ?"&#xD;
"He! he broke out into fury! he heaped every&#xD;
sort of obscene and blasphemous abuse upon Ar-&#xD;
deane."&#xD;
"Oh, Mary Mother! Oh, All merciful Lord 1"&#xD;
prayed Winny, with clasped hands and pallid&#xD;
brow-" and Ardenne! and Ardenne I"&#xD;
"He was your father, Winny, and that cir-&#xD;
cumatance struck your lover powerless before&#xD;
him. Any other man but your father must have&#xD;
perished then and there by the roused wrath or&#xD;
your lover-the old bear would have been but as&#xD;
a child in the grasp of the young lion' But could&#xD;
he lay hands on your father? Ardenne was pale&#xD;
with the passion he controlled. He bore tts@&#xD;
taunts, the insults, the obscene epithets heaped.&#xD;
unon his head, with the meekness! fihi .4 ~ the&#xD;
meekness of the lamb, for your sake, Winny 1"&#xD;

&#xD;
Sina spoke with so much eloquence of words,&#xD;
tones, anti gestures, That bad as she was, she&#xD;
must nave in a degree felt what she uttered.-&#xD;
Winny had been white with terror at the com-&#xD;
mencement of the description-the tears that&#xD;
had been frozen at their fountain now melted and&#xD;
ran down her cheeks-but the lightning flashed&#xD;
through the shower as she said,&#xD;
~J'tiat contumely should be heaped upon his&#xD;
head! My noble, my high-souled, my god-like&#xD;
one! My archangel! and by my father! But&#xD;
I-even 1 will compensate him! 1, whom they&#xD;
call the heiress of 04k Grove; to whom every&#xD;
one bows with such profound deference; 1, be-&#xD;

to make nay; I, the only daughter of the&#xD;
haughty Darlings, will show him so much defer-&#xD;
ence, so much meekness, so much submission,&#xD;
anti so, if contempt approach, I must absorb it-&#xD;
it shall not touch my archangel! He shall feel&#xD;
that however others, in their blindness, may&#xD;
mistake and contemn him, he is my archangel&#xD;
still I"&#xD;
"Bat when do you expect to see him again,&#xD;
since he has left 0 ik Grove ?" said Sina, break-&#xD;
ing in upon the maiden's enthusiasm. ' What&#xD;
opportunity do you expect to find for all this&#xD;
compensation, my dearest Winny ?"&#xD;
"True! true! Oh, Virgin Mother! oh, pity-&#xD;
ing Seviour! what will console him in his sor-&#xD;
row?"&#xD;
&#xD;
cuitidren-he whose talents opened for him the&#xD;
road to the highest distinction!"&#xD;
"Oh, All-merciful Father! not that fate for&#xD;
Au denne! come degradation! come contempt to&#xD;
me rather!"&#xD;
"Listen again! he will be here this evening.&#xD;
I will admit him when the company are at the&#xD;
height of their dancing in the saloon. He will&#xD;
ask you to fly with him-do not refuse him."&#xD;
"But, oh merciful heaven! my poor father!"&#xD;
"He trampled the honor of your lover under&#xD;
his feet!" said the astute Sina.&#xD;
The eyes of Winny flashed through their tears.&#xD;
Then Sina said calmly,&#xD;
"Nonsense! Fathers make a great row be-&#xD;
forehand, but afterwards they all become agreea-&#xD;
ble enough. Your father would never consent&#xD;
to your marriage, but when you are once mar-&#xD;
ried, he will readily forgive you-how can he help&#xD;
it? What geod will it do him to retain his wick-&#xD;
ed anger, for do you Aot see, that though his&#xD;
anger might prevent yaur getting married, and&#xD;
is so far useful, yet once married, his persistence&#xD;
in anger cannot unmarry you, and is therefore&#xD;
useless. He will be too wise to persevere in&#xD;
what is useless as well as wrong. B~msides, as 1&#xD;
said, he cannot help it. You are his only child.&#xD;
He loves you-he cannot live without you."&#xD;
"Ahi what an ungrateful child I should be to&#xD;
leave him then, my poor, old, fond father, my&#xD;
good father !"&#xD;
&#xD;
I,&#xD;
&#xD;
"You will! You spoke just now from the "He called Ardenne a-, and an-, and a-" ~&#xD;
depths of your prophetic heart. It will be as you "Oh! for goodness sake hush! you make me&#xD;
have dreamed and as you have said, but you deadly sick."&#xD;
must have faith and courage. Listen! he loves "I was about to say before you stopped me&#xD;

Winny again grew very pale. "Might lose and love and honor him for your sake-and do&#xD;
his reason and be sent to the lunatic asylum, you not perceive that that will even neutralize the&#xD;
and lastly and worst and most probable of all-" disgrace of the abuse he has received-for that&#xD;
"Well Well ?" gasped Winny, clasping her which would tarnish the honor of a man coming&#xD;
hands. "Well? Well ?" from another man, would lose its power coming&#xD;
"Might and would, it is likely, take to drink, I from his father-in-law. It is no dishonor to&#xD;

like Mike Lengron-think of the degradation "So it is not!" replied Winny.&#xD;

He shall never, never know it from me&#xD;

"Or! my dear love, do not so cruelly mis&#xD;

Sina smiled to herself-her end was achieved&#xD;
-secrecy as to her interference was pledged&#xD;
from Winny, as it had been from Ardenne, with-&#xD;
out her seeming to care that it should be so.&#xD;
"Now, love," she said, kissing her, "you are&#xD;
not able to go down into the ball'room to-night&#xD;
--you must remain here-I will send you some&#xD;
tea and toast ;" and Sina arose, and left the&#xD;
room On the first landing she met Squire Darling.&#xD;
"How is my little unfortunate ?"&#xD;
"Oh! more cheerful, sir !-far more cheerful,&#xD;
but not able, I think, to bear the excitement of&#xD;
the ball-room!"&#xD;
"We must make excuses for her, and try to&#xD;
let her absence be as little observed as possible.&#xD;
Fortunately my good mother has retired to bed,&#xD;
without having inquired for her-imagining her,&#xD;
I suppose, to be in the chamber of her Aunt&#xD;
Summerfield."&#xD;
"Um-m-me," cooed Sina, "that is so well!&#xD;
It would be such a pity that the dear old lady&#xD;
should be disturbed."&#xD;
"SinaI"&#xD;
" Sir!"&#xD;
"On my soul, Bina, you havqe got the&#xD;

from him, the squire waddled off.&#xD;

I, "Why what a disgusting old soul! I do nope&#xD;

tered Colonel Dangerfield and Harry Joy, just as&#xD;
they returned from their sporting expedition.&#xD;
Harry's broad white brow shining between its&#xD;

"You are late, miss-mach of the expected&#xD;

We will take glance into the saloon first. Only&#xD;
a glance, for Winny is absent-Winny, who, as&#xD;
the daughter of the host, should be "the bright&#xD;
particular star," "the star of that goodly com-&#xD;
pany." Miss Hinton, arrayed in a mazarine blue&#xD;
satin that became her dark style well, and ha-&#xD;
ving her hair in long black, ringlets, received the&#xD;
company with much grace. Squire Darling&#xD;
stood on her right, his stout figure and fresh toi-&#xD;
let, his fair Saxon face and fair curling hair&#xD;
looking the very picture of a debonair country&#xD;
gentleman. No one, as he smiled and bowed&#xD;
and wiped his brow, and welcomed his guests&#xD;
and chattered to his attractive assistant Sina-&#xD;
no, not a soul would have believed that he had,&#xD;
in a manner, just kicked the tutor out of doors&#xD;
and locked his daughter up. And as for Sina-&#xD;
who, to see her smiling and cooing, patronizing&#xD;
or consoling, could have believed that she was&#xD;
at the bottom of all the trouble ~. Sina coos to&#xD;
him, smiles on him, and leans heavily upon his&#xD;
stout arm. He holds her arm rather tiger than&#xD;
strictly necessary, clipping it close to his side;&#xD;
he holds her vinaigrette and wields her fan, and&#xD;
presents every stranger who comes up-to "My&#xD;
cousin, Miss Hinton, of Georgetown."&#xD;

save so. Come here, Sina."&#xD;
And Sina glided from the other end of the&#xD;
room, to the side of Winny, caressed, cajoled,&#xD;
soothed, reassured her.&#xD;
It is useless to repeat the persuasive sophis-&#xD;
tries of this unprincipled and dangerous girl. It&#xD;
is sufficient to say that then and there the plan,&#xD;
the time and the piace of the elopement were&#xD;
arranged. Ardenne took his leave. Winny&#xD;
sunk weeping upon the false, soft bosom of her&#xD;
treacherous friend. Sina laid her down, and&#xD;
returned quickly, and with some trepidation, to&#xD;
the bail-room. All was safe for her there, how-&#xD;
ever.&#xD;
"Where have you been, you wretched little&#xD;
flirt ?" questioned the' squire.&#xD;
"With Winny."&#xD;
"Ah, you spoil that naughty child-poor little&#xD;
thing-how is she 1"&#xD;
"Very well I asleep, I believe, now."&#xD;
"Ah I-hum! I knew she would get over her&#xD;
crying fits and fainting fits I-that's right!"&#xD;

Down in one of those picturesque gaps of the&#xD;
Blue Ridge, watbred by a branch of the Shenan-&#xD;
doah, stood the old Catholic Chapel of the Sa-&#xD;
cred Heart, erected by the first American Sum..&#xD;
merfield. It was a small gothic building, con-&#xD;
structed of red sand-stone, in the form of a cros,&#xD;
with a tower and steeple at the end. It was&#xD;
surrounded by a graveyard, in which reposed&#xD;
the mortal remains of all the Summerfteld fa-&#xD;
mily. Adjoining this chapel was a small cot-&#xD;
tage, built also of red sand-stone, and surrounded&#xD;
with a small garden-yard; farther off, an or-&#xD;
chard of various kinds of fruit trees. This mo-&#xD;
dest dwelling was the home of the old priest,&#xD;
Father Burleigh, his niece Harry, and his house-&#xD;
keeper, Miss Matilda or Mattie ~milie, an&#xD;
cient maiden and a lay sister of the order of -&#xD;
Mount Cannel. It was a very poor-looking&#xD;
house for a clergyman. It wanted all those&#xD;
little comforts and luxuries with which zealous&#xD;
Catholics love to surround their Father in the-&#xD;
Lord. Not but that the few parishioners of the&#xD;
old priest were kind and liberal, and wished to&#xD;
enrich him, but because they sos~s few, and&#xD;

old man's tea was getting ready.&#xD;
"Ras Elarriette returned?" he asked, witi&#xD;
some vi rvxiety, of the housekeeper.&#xD;
"No ~&#xD;
"Where is she 2"&#xD;
"Your reverence knows, sir, that Miss Harr3&#xD;
left here to go to Oak Grove. I suppose she ii&#xD;
there. with Miss Winny. Though Miss Harr3&#xD;
and Miss Hinton are the best friends."&#xD;
"Miss Elinton! I utterly object to that asso.&#xD;
citation, Mattie. If Harriette returns while I am&#xD;
out to-morrow, tell her so I"&#xD;
The placid housekeeper promised compliance,&#xD;
and set the tea on the table.&#xD;
The old priest changed his boots for slippers,&#xD;
and drew his chair to the table.&#xD;
When supper was over, and the table-cloth&#xD;
removed, and the reading-lamp lighted and set&#xD;
upon it, and Father Burleigh had taken down a&#xD;
volume of the "Lives of the Saints," and laying&#xD;
it on ~e table, had opened and commenced read-&#xD;
ing, Miss Mattie went up to him, and with a&#xD;
meek, halt-chastened tone, said-&#xD;
~'Have you forgotten, Father Burleigh 2"&#xD;
'~ Forgotten what ?"&#xD;
"The poor souls in purgatory."&#xD;
By no means, my good Mattie-what mean&#xD;
you by the question 2"&#xD;
"1 mean you know the speerit 1 saw I"&#xD;
"Oh, nonsense, my good soul I Some mis-&#xD;
chievous person is practising on your credulity,&#xD;
to am se him or herself with your fright."&#xD;
"But your reverence promised-"&#xD;
"I promised to investigate it. I will do so,"&#xD;
and the old man, resuming his cap and his staff,&#xD;
went forth.&#xD;
It was very dark; the lofty mountains loomed&#xD;
gloomily into the clouded sky; the hollow moan&#xD;
of a rising wind through the forest, and the&#xD;
hoarse murmur of the swollen river, as it swept&#xD;
past, were the only sounds that . disturbed the&#xD;
otherwise dead silence. The priest looked&#xD;
around upon the murky darkness of the sullen&#xD;
scene, and seemed to find a morose pleasure in&#xD;
its assimilitude to his own soul; then, with an&#xD;
imperceptible smiles at his own credulity, he&#xD;
turned his steps to where the white tombstones&#xD;
of tue church-yard gleamed faintly out in the&#xD;
darkness. He passed the little gate, and was&#xD;
within the enclosure. Nothing was to be seen I&#xD;
&#xD;
r bur~-near, the white and spectral-looking tomb.&#xD;
r stones, and-far, the dark and looming moun.&#xD;
tains; and nothing was to be heard but the&#xD;
hollow groans of the wind among the mountain-&#xD;
- pines, answered by the hoarse moan of the&#xD;
s river at their base. A vague, but awful terror,&#xD;
* or presentiment-or some equally fearful jnflu-&#xD;
- ence, weighed down the spirit of the priest, and&#xD;
he was about to retrace his steps, whe&#xD;
"At last!" exclaimed a thrilling voice, near&#xD;
him.&#xD;
An icy chill ran through the veins of the&#xD;
priest-his blood curdled. He was neither cow-&#xD;
ardly nor superstitious, hut the time, the place,&#xD;
the circumstances, his shattered nervous system&#xD;
-certain dark memories of the past, all conspir-&#xD;
ed to betray his courage. He looked around, but&#xD;
saw nothing-nothing but the old chapel, the&#xD;
* spectral tombstones, a~d the giant mountains.&#xD;
"Who speaks?" he asked, in a quivering K&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
" Who ~ was the response.&#xD;
"It is 1-Father Bixrleigh-pastor of the Sa-&#xD;
cred Heart Parish-and who art thou?'&#xD;
"One who knows the deepest secrets of thy soul,&#xD;
Barna6as Burleigls, pastor of the Sacred Heart!"&#xD;
Again the blood of the old priest was turned I&#xD;
back in its course.&#xD;
"And what-wnat wouldst thou with me 2"&#xD;
gasped the unhappy man, as his knees smote to-&#xD;
gether.&#xD;
"Follow ens !" replied the voice; and at the&#xD;
same moment a figure clothed in white emerged&#xD;
from the deep darkness, and glided up the path&#xD;
before him leading to the chapel.&#xD;
The priest followed, with tottering steps, de-&#xD;
spite the support of the staff he leaned upon.&#xD;
The figure paused at the church door.&#xD;
"Opem it !" said the mystery, receding, and&#xD;
leaving the way unobstructed for the priest to&#xD;
pass.*&#xD;
Father Burleigh stooped, and drawing the key&#xD;
from its hiding-place under the door-step, un-&#xD;
locked the door and entered. The white figure&#xD;
glided after him. The priest gained the steps&#xD;
of the altar, struck a light, and turning with a&#xD;
newly summoned courage-for there was a feel-&#xD;
ing of sanctity, of safety, in the walls of the&#xD;
church-in the precincts of the altar-he flashed&#xD;
its light upon the advancing figure, and said, in&#xD;
a stern voice, and with a frowning, though pal-&#xD;
lid brow-&#xD;
"Come I-approach, intruding spy I-reveal&#xD;
thyself&#xD;
The figure walked straight up the aisle,&#xD;
paused before the blazing torch, threw back a&#xD;
large, muffling, white muslin veil, and revealed&#xD;
the face of Sina Hinton, sparkling with the light&#xD;
of its insolent defiance and malignant joy I&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER iX.&#xD;
THE EVIl SPIRIT.&#xD;
By thy cold breast and serpent smile,&#xD;
By thy unfathomed gulfs of guile,&#xD;
By that mod seeming virtuous eye,&#xD;
By thy shut soul's hypocrisy,&#xD;
By the perfection of thine art,&#xD;
That passed for human thine own heart,&#xD;
By thy delight in others' pain,&#xD;
And by thy sisterhood of Cain,&#xD;
I call upon thee, and compel&#xD;
Thyself to be thy proper hell.  Byron&#xD;
"Dark, dreadful girl! what wouldst thou&#xD;
with me?"&#xD;
It was some moments before she replied; and in&#xD;
that time her eyes were fired upon his as though&#xD;
she would strike that sharp, bright glance deep&#xD;
into the profoundest depths of his soul, and read&#xD;
there how much of principle might remain to de-&#xD;
fend-how much of fear to betray him late her&#xD;
power.&#xD;
Alas! the eyes of the anointed priest qualled&#xD;
and fell before those of the sinful girl.&#xD;
Then she laughed aloud and said, "Oh! I&#xD;
have no secrets from you! Come hither, Father I"&#xD;
and drawing him into a side pew, she sat down&#xD;
before him. The priest trembled in every limb,&#xD;
and covered his face with his har~ls. "I looked&#xD;
into your soul just now to satisfy myself of what&#xD;
1 almost knew before-that is, that I should find&#xD;
a coadjutor-not a betrayer in you I"&#xD;
"Lost girl! That your purposes are all bad,&#xD;
I read in the fiend-like exultation of your coun-&#xD;
tenance! Dare you count upon my co-operation?"&#xD;
"Yes! I am mistress of your secret !"&#xD;
"And though that secret, wretched girl,&#xD;
should consign me to a-'~&#xD;
C5~caffold!~~&#xD;
The old man shuddered from head to foot as&#xD;
he faltered-&#xD;
"And even then, detestable girl, do you think&#xD;
that I will lend myseL~ to any wicked purpose of&#xD;
yours 2"&#xD;
"Poh!" exclaimed Sina, with infinite disgust.&#xD;
"You judge my purpose by your past. I have slo-&#xD;
thing~ in hand, at which your moral cowardice&#xD;
shalL shrink, for I have nothing in hand that&#xD;
shall break any one of the ten commandments,&#xD;
or any law of the land-as it happens!"&#xD;
"As it happens? And if it were otherwise 2"&#xD;
inquired the priest, fixing his piercing black eye~&#xD;
upon those of Sina, and seeming for the moment&#xD;
even to lose his fears in serious contemplation&#xD;
of this singular being&#xD;
sShe did not quail under that glance, as she re-&#xD;
plied, boldly-" If it were otherwise, it would&#xD;
make no whit of difference with ens-whatever&#xD;
it might with you!"&#xD;
"Audacious girl-you glory in your wicked-&#xD;
ness!~,&#xD;
&#xD;
~%1 TRIUMPH IN MY POWER&#xD;
"Woman! you are transfigured before rae!&#xD;
Your eyes flare! they flame! You are a fiend I"&#xD;
"You have a fine imagination, Father, though&#xD;
rather a diabolical one-fine, as that of the moon-&#xD;
struck poet, Ardenne, who calls me an angel,&#xD;
and whose fancies, in contradistinction of your&#xD;
own, may be called celestial. Now, neither of&#xD;
you have hit it! This is the truth. There was&#xD;
in me, as in you, and in us all, originally, an&#xD;
angel and a devil, striving for pre-eminence.&#xD;
They kept up in my soul such an eternal war&#xD;
that I had no peace between them, so I just&#xD;
strangled and cast out the angel, and the fiend&#xD;
has quiet possession. I advise you to do the&#xD;
same I"&#xD;
The priest was leaning over the front of the&#xD;
pew, contemplating her as she sat there. "Sa-&#xD;
tanic wisdom!"&#xD;
"Discord in the soul is weakness-war in the&#xD;
soul is impotency; so long as the good and evil&#xD;
strive in us, we have no will, no individuality,&#xD;
no life-it is only at the end of the struggle that&#xD;
we are born into life, the life of an angel or of a&#xD;
devil-even in this world-and that life brings&#xD;
power! grand power! Napoleon never would&#xD;
have been Emperor, if he had not possessed a&#xD;
vigorous will, and early put an end to the inner&#xD;
struggle-early strangled and cast out the angel!&#xD;
The life that you see around you, is not life, but&#xD;
a chaos of good and evil impulses in which indi-&#xD;
viduality-' rnyself'-is lost. Three destinies&#xD;
await the soul at the death of the body-angel-&#xD;
life, demon-life, or annihilation; angel-life to&#xD;
those who have expelled the fiend-demon-life&#xD;
to those who have cast out the angel-annihila'&#xD;
tion to those weak souls lost in the struggle. Au&#xD;
weak infants perish in the crisis of birth, or even&#xD;
before-so weak souls perish in the crisis of&#xD;
death, or even before. iMMoRTALITY IS ron.&#xD;
THOSE ONLY, WHO ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO GRASP&#xD;
IT&#xD;
"Incarnate fiend! have you chosen this holy&#xD;
ground to deliver your diabolical heresies only?&#xD;
or have you any other purpose? if so) speak it!&#xD;
for my soul is scorched by your presence as my&#xD;
body would be by the proximity of a conflagra-&#xD;
tion!"&#xD;
"Go on, sir! my father who. was expert at&#xD;
gambling used to say that it was the privilege&#xD;
of the beaten to swear!"&#xD;
"Will you tell me why you seek me in this&#xD;
secret way I"&#xD;
"Truth, Father, 1 love to proibng this conver-&#xD;
sation! It is so seldom I find one with whom 1&#xD;
can be really frank as I can with you-it is qulte&#xD;
refreshing I'&#xD;
The fingers of the priest worked convulsively,&#xD;
his sunken eyes flashed for an instant and thea&#xD;
fell-a power as of myriads of angels had sought&#xD;
to draw him away-a power as of hosts of de-&#xD;
mons held him tohis seat. The hour and the&#xD;

place, deep, dark night, the interior of the lone&#xD;
old church, the presence of this evil spirit scarce~&#xD;
ly less terrible to him than if disembodied, all&#xD;
acted upon his shattered nerves and held him in&#xD;
a state of hopeless imbecility, fitfully varied by&#xD;
spasms of resistance, each of which left him&#xD;
weaker than before; at last he said, in a smo-&#xD;
thered voice,&#xD;
ft Girl! thou knowest my secret-by what ne-&#xD;
cromancy, it is bootlessto ask-but, thouknowest&#xD;
my secret I what is the price of thy silence?"&#xD;
"AhI now thou comes to the point. In a&#xD;
word, then. Edgar Ardenne called upon you last&#xD;
week with a request that you would unite him-&#xD;
self and Miss Darling in marriage, and you re-&#xD;
fused to do so 1"&#xD;
.~" 1 did! I will not officiate in a clandestine&#xD;
marriage. I wonder that any minister of t~e&#xD;
gospel ever should."&#xD;
"Exemplary old man! would you have the&#xD;
young peopleelope without being married? for&#xD;
that would be the end of your morality."&#xD;
"I would have all ministers of the gospel and&#xD;
all others do their simple duty, and leave the&#xD;
con5equences~~~~&#xD;
"I might prove that those very 'consequences'&#xD;
affect the very point of 'duty,' but I will not. I&#xD;
will only remark that I wish you to reconsider&#xD;
that decision! I wish you to pronounce the&#xD;
nuptial benediction that shall unite forever the&#xD;
destinies of Edgar Ardenne and Winny Darling!&#xD;
and at no later period than to-morrow eve&#xD;
ning!"&#xD;
"Ha! now do you not know, Miss Hinton,&#xD;
that such a ceremony would be null and void,&#xD;
that both Ardenne and Miss Darling are under&#xD;
age, and that in Virginia the marriage of minors&#xD;
without the consent of their parents and guar-&#xD;
dians is illegal, invalid ?"&#xD;
"Full well I know that, but I know also that&#xD;
as England has its Gretna-Green, so Virginia has&#xD;
its Harper's Ferry, and that this law of Virginia&#xD;
does not diminish the annual number of youthful&#xD;
marriages. 1 know that its only effect is to take&#xD;
from the treasury of the State of Virginia, and&#xD;
to throw into the treasury of the State of Mary-&#xD;
land several thousand dollars annually, in the&#xD;
money paid for marriage licenses by citizens of&#xD;
Virginia to the clerks of the county courts of&#xD;
Maryland: so much for their imported English&#xD;
law! Now what I want you to do, Father Bur-&#xD;
leigh, is this-Edgar Ardenne and Winny Dar-&#xD;
ling will be at Harper's Ferry to-morrow eve-&#xD;
ning meet them there, cross the Potomac&#xD;
with them, unite them in the State of Marylane."&#xD;
"And the license then ?"&#xD;
"No difficulty will be met there! The host&#xD;
of the hotel at Harper's Ferry 'keeps constantly&#xD;
on hand a supply' of blank licenses from the&#xD;
Court of Hagerstown, 'which he will sell at a&#xD;
small advance,"' laughed Bina.&#xD;
Theface of the priest could not be seen-.-the-&#xD;
&#xD;
light he l~eld was flickering out-he did not&#xD;
* speak in reply to what she last said.&#xD;
*   "And Father, notice-listen !-for now comes&#xD;
the very point of my argument. My own parei~&#xD;
citation in this affair must not be known No!&#xD;
not to one single soul-for, Father, the day that&#xD;
I lose fsvor in this neighborhood; that very day&#xD;
your secret is given to the winds !"&#xD;
Tne light flashed up in an expiring flare, illu-&#xD;
minating the thin, fierce features, and piercing&#xD;
eyes of the fiendish girl, and then went out in&#xD;
darkness.&#xD;
CHAPTER X.&#xD;
THE FLIGHT OF THE LOVE-ANGEL.&#xD;
I leave thee, father! Eve's bright moon&#xD;
Must now light other feet,&#xD;
With the gathered grapes and the harp in tune,&#xD;
Thy homeward steps to greet.&#xD;
Thou in whose voice to bless thy child&#xD;
Lay tones of love so deep&#xD;
Whose eye o'er all my youth hath smiled-&#xD;
I leave thee !-Let me weep!&#xD;
Mother, I leave thee! on thy breast,&#xD;
Pouring out joy and woe,&#xD;
I have found that holy place of ret&#xD;
Still changeless-yei I go!&#xD;
Lips th* have lulled me with yoix strain,&#xD;
Eves that have watched my sleep!&#xD;
Will earth give love like yours again,&#xD;
Dear mother !-Let me weep!&#xD;
Mrs. Hemans&#xD;
Oak Grove lay hushed ai~ basking in the noon&#xD;
of an August day-the silence only dreamily&#xD;
disturbed by the drowsy murmur of the breeze&#xD;
au~ong the foliage. Dinner was over, and the&#xD;
squire, clad in a cool white linen jacket and&#xD;
trowsers, was lying at length upon tue long&#xD;
bench of the front piazza, taking his siesta.-&#xD;
The county paper with which he had read him-&#xD;
self to sleep, had dropped from hiss hand. A&#xD;
drowsy little black boy in his shirt sleeves, was&#xD;
keeping the flies off his master, with a bunch of&#xD;
long peacock feathers. It is a warm, heavy,&#xD;
sleepy season, and the little negro nods, and&#xD;
bobs, and sways the peacock feathers. Presently&#xD;
he will inevitably slap it into the face of his&#xD;
master, who will wake up swearing.&#xD;
In another part of the house, Madam Wini.&#xD;
fred, in her own chamber, knelt at her mid-day&#xD;
devotions.&#xD;
in still another chamber, sat Winny and Sina.&#xD;
They sat by a window that was closely shaded&#xD;
with green foliage, the favorite resort Qf singing&#xD;
birds, which the gentleness of Winny had never&#xD;
alarmed. And through these green branches&#xD;
were caught short views of the level lawn, dot-&#xD;
ted with huge oak trees, and a glimpse of the&#xD;
distant quarters. Winny leaned upon her right&#xD;
elbow, and gazed tearfully from this empowered&#xD;
&#xD;
window Her other hand was neit ny ~ a,&#xD;
who pressed and kissed it frequently, or stroked&#xD;
her golden ringlets, and spoke to her tenderly&#xD;
and soothingly.&#xD;
"Bitt Sina-dear Sina-this is the last, the&#xD;
very last day that I shall stay at home! and it&#xD;
) ka~over. And to think that I am receivingg&#xD;
my trusting father and my dear, dear graudmo&#xD;
ther! that I. whom they love so fondly, so much&#xD;
more than I deserve -I, whom they call their&#xD;
'darting,' their 'blessing,' their elove.angel,~&#xD;
f should d-ceive and desert them! Oh, it is very,&#xD;
~ very ~~ri ked ~iI&#xD;
WdI, my love, if you think so, abandon the&#xD;
projecr~and it Ardenne, in his disappointment&#xD;
and despair, should blow his brains out "&#xD;
Winny turned pale, an~ shuddered from head&#xD;
iF foot.&#xD;
"Should blow his brains out. as young Fisher&#xD;
~ did w~.en Mary Key Dorsey jilted him last&#xD;
montn, I do not know I am not sure, that the&#xD;
sin wit be laid at your door. You would be&#xD;
quite rn"inno cent cause of bis suicide."&#xD;
Win ny was scarcely sixteen-a mere child-&#xD;
a country child-a home-educated child- with-&#xD;
out the slightest protective knowledge of the&#xD;
world-without the slightest suspicion of its&#xD;
falsehood. Blame her filial impiety as it de-&#xD;
serves-as she blames it herself, b11o not call&#xD;
tier weak, or foolish in her crediM'y of Sina's&#xD;
representations. She was not naturally weak or&#xD;
foolish, as her brave and patient after-life pro.&#xD;
veil-no, she was only immature, sensitive, con-&#xD;
"Yen do not dread this, 1 know; catastrophe.&#xD;
are always unexpected-but-"&#xD;
"Oh! say no more! I shall not recede now!&#xD;
I have no power to turn back now! I am whirl.&#xD;
ed rapidly onward by a current I cannot arrest!&#xD;
Cannot. because I will not! Inclination hurries&#xD;
me forward-only duty, conscience, the memory&#xD;
of all the wrong I do those whom I love and&#xD;
leave, would stop me-but cannot-only troubles&#xD;
me! But I will not be traitor to my own con-&#xD;
science; 1 will not say that it exonerates, when&#xD;
it bitterly accuses me! I will not say that I&#xD;
think I am doing right, when 1 know and feel&#xD;
that I am doing wrong! wrong! wrong I-oh,&#xD;
so very wrong! I may have sinned before, but&#xD;
certainly [never suffered from remorse&#xD;
"My dear love! my sweet Winny! my angel!&#xD;
do not talk so! Remorse-for what? You&#xD;
talk as though you were about to commit some&#xD;
atrocious wickedness. You are going to be&#xD;
married, and marriage is a holy state!"&#xD;
"Yes! marriage is a holy state! ~ feel that&#xD;
-oh, so deeply, so strongly, so profoundly now!&#xD;
But 1 feel, too, that in entering this holy state&#xD;
against my dear grandmother, my more than&#xD;
mother's wishes-without my father's blessing,&#xD;
and in i~efiance of his curse, that I desecrate a&#xD;
sanctuary-.--that [~ommit a sacrilege, even as&#xD;
&#xD;
inuc .i~ enough I seized with 'impious hands,&#xD;
and quaffed ~eith unholy lips, the sacred cup of&#xD;
the eucharist!"&#xD;
"Winny! Wiuny! my ttttle love! do not&#xD;
talk so! You are already mart ted! By the&#xD;
mutual attractions God cas placed in your hearts&#xD;
He has already married you. You do but lega-&#xD;
lize on earth what God has done in Heaven I"&#xD;
"That is true! and yet-and yet-there is a&#xD;
disturbance-a discord in my soul-a bright joy&#xD;
struggling with a dark trouble-as if I had stolen&#xD;
as a thief into Heaven, with the sins of earth all&#xD;
clinging around me&#xD;
For the first time, Sina Hinron lost her self-&#xD;
command; in truth, for a week she had had "a&#xD;
job" in the several parts she had played with&#xD;
Winny, with Ardenne, with the squire and the&#xD;
priest, and her patience wus about exhausted -&#xD;
she jumped up and walked the floor in hasty&#xD;
strides, exclaiming-&#xD;
"In the name of Judas! then send word to&#xD;
Edgar to go about his business, and so drop the&#xD;
whole matter!"&#xD;
Winny held out her hand.&#xD;
"Be patient with me, Sina! dear Sina I-you&#xD;
who have nothing to reproach yourself with-&#xD;
you do not understand my feeling; even as I&#xD;
who never experienced physical pain, am puzzled&#xD;
to know why the sick should groan and write&#xD;
so! Be patient, Sina! Come back to me! I&#xD;
told you I would go-I will go But come,&#xD;
Sina! there are some things I wish to leave&#xD;
with you to do."&#xD;
Miss Hinton came and sat again by her side,&#xD;
embraced her, and said-&#xD;
"Forgive me, Winny-but my dear child,&#xD;
your morbid sensibility does try my patience,&#xD;
sadly-and what is the use of it? You compared&#xD;
your course just now to the whirl of a current&#xD;
of destiny."&#xD;
CC No-not of destiny-I did not so excuse my-&#xD;
self-to a current of inclination"&#xD;
"It is the same thing. Let me remind you&#xD;
now of our boating on the Shenandoah. You&#xD;
and Ardenne were in a skiff together-we bad&#xD;
many, many miles of smooth water from liar&#xD;
per's Ferry up to Shannondale, there we got in-&#xD;
to the rapids, and for a few minutes, during&#xD;
which we crossed them, our situation seemed -&#xD;
it was only seeming-very perilous! You held&#xD;
your very breath for awe !-yet in less than an&#xD;
hour, we were in smooth water again, and con-&#xD;
tinued our course gleefully. You are now in eke&#xD;
rapids of your life, and your griet and remorse&#xD;
are now as gratuitous and as temporary as your&#xD;
awe and terror were then Oh! nonsense! my&#xD;

claimed Harriette, in alarm. Why didn't ~ou&#xD;
tell me of her illness the first thing? Who is&#xD;
with her? Has a doctor been sent for? Where&#xD;
is Squire Darling ?" And she jumped from her&#xD;
horse and hurried towards the house, followed&#xD;
by old Nerve, who was terrified half to death by&#xD;
a fact that Harry's words had only just made&#xD;
known to her-&#xD;
"You-you don't think It is-that there? do&#xD;
you, Miss Harry ?"&#xD;
C' It is paralysis, I am sure of it I Where is&#xD;

'God bless you, honey, he don't know nothiri&#xD;

"is tt possible that he has left the house, and&#xD;
his mother-dying, perhaps!'&#xD;
Tl~y had now reached the house, which was&#xD;
~tll iii confusion.&#xD;

yine up the stairs&#xD;
SCM,,,.. Sina Hinton-an' 'fore my Elebenly&#xD;

on top o' her, but blessed be my Hebenly Jeave,&#xD;
the first time as ever I sot my eye on her, I telt&#xD;
as something' evil had come to the house I"&#xD;
This conversation brought them to the door ot&#xD;
t'ie aged woman's chamber. Harriette entered&#xD;
sifily- the room was silent as death, aiid so&#xD;
dark that it was some seconds before 'larriette&#xD;
could discern the prostrate form ol the old lady,&#xD;
*-~xtended nearly lifeless on the bed Sina Kin-&#xD;
~on sat near the head of the bed, but did not&#xD;
~eem to be doing any other duty than watching.&#xD;
Rarriette drew near-and after gazing with pro-&#xD;
trnnd sorrow, reverence and awe upon this for.&#xD;
sakon sick bed, she turned, and whispering softly&#xD;
to Sina, inquired if a physician had been sum-&#xD;
noned, and if Squire Darling had been sent for?&#xD;
Woat was her surprise and indignation to learn,&#xD;
that neither had been done. Miss Hinton had&#xD;
apprehended no danger, she said, and so bad ta-&#xD;
tren no precaution. And now Elarrietto discern-&#xD;
~-d at once the cause of poor old Nerve's previous&#xD;
freedom from alarm upon the subject And for&#xD;
the first time in her life, she sent a suspicious,&#xD;
searching, angry glance, deep into the eyes of&#xD;
Sina; but those orbs opposed their large, sha-&#xD;
dowy tenderness, and the fire of Harriette's&#xD;
glance was quenched in the liquid softness of&#xD;
Sina's eyes. Harriette reproached herself for&#xD;
unj ust, and even most unreasonable suspicion-&#xD;
for, "what motive," she asked herself, "could&#xD;
"ma have, for purposely omitting to use say&#xD;
means for the recovery of the old lady ?" Then&#xD;
she hurried out, and sent messengers, post-haste,&#xD;
for a physician, for Squire Darling, and for her&#xD;
uncle, the priest, and then at more leisure, dis-&#xD;
patcned a servant to Shannondale, to inform Mrs.&#xD;
Summerfield of the dangerous illness of her mo-&#xD;
ther.             ______&#xD;
Evening drew on. The messenger sent for&#xD;
the squire had returned and declared himself&#xD;
nable to find his master in any of bis usual&#xD;
aunts. Mrs. Suinmerfield. ae'"m.sr,'- by&#xD;
Mi~e Summerfield, and escorted by Colonel Dan-&#xD;
gerfield had arrived, and they were waiting in&#xD;
another room the permission of the young priest&#xD;
who had been called from St. Joseph's in the ab-&#xD;
sence of Father Burleigh to enter the chamber.&#xD;
The family physician, who had quickly obeyed&#xD;
the hasty summons, had been with her exerting&#xD;
all the powers of his art for her restoration-and&#xD;
all in vain or with but partial success. Late in&#xD;
the evening she recovered her speech in an im-&#xD;
perfect degree. "My son-I must see-msj&#xD;
son!" were the first broken, nearl unintelligi-&#xD;
ble words she spoke The doctor stepped out to&#xD;
Colonel Dangerfield and told him of this-uriring&#xD;
at the same time tha great necessity of Squire&#xD;
Darling's speedy arrival if he would see his&#xD;
mother living.&#xD;

CC The messenger could not find 'ii in- ue must&#xD;
have pursued his fugitive 'auguter arid ncr lover&#xD;
to Harper's Ferry I will go myself in search&#xD;
of him," said Colonel Dangerfield, and ringing,&#xD;
he ordered the fleetest and strongest horse in the&#xD;
stables to be saddled and brought around. And&#xD;
in ten minutes Colonel Dangerfield was urging&#xD;
his fiery steed to its utmost speed over the hills&#xD;
and precipices that lay between Oak Grove and&#xD;
Harper's Ferry.&#xD;
Hours passed on, during which the old lady's&#xD;
life seemed ebbing fast away. Again she strove&#xD;
tospeak, and when the physician bent down close&#xD;
to hear her words she articulated with great diffi-&#xD;
culty-" Margaret-Imogene-my children I"&#xD;
and Mrs. and Miss Summerfield were permitted&#xD;
to approach her bedside. She looked on them&#xD;
with so much love struggling through the death-&#xD;
ly agony of her fhce! She tried again to speak;&#xD;
Mrs. Summerfield, her eyes streaming with&#xD;
tears, bent over to catch the words It was an&#xD;
abortive effort. The aged countenance was con-&#xD;
vulsed a moment and then settled-they thought&#xD;
in death-hut it was not so-again, and oh! with&#xD;
what a power I-with what a conquering oinni-&#xD;
potence of mighty love! the soul struggled for a&#xD;
moment to overcome, to pierce through the phy-&#xD;
sical torpor. the mortal torpor-to coirirnune&#xD;
with its mortal loved! It conquers! it con-&#xD;
quers! light again melts through the glazed&#xD;
eyes! the pinched and sunken lips again&#xD;
move! Mrs. Summerfield bends to catch&#xD;
the words-'~ Winnv-Winny---forgive-love-&#xD;
bless-"&#xD;
She was sinking again.&#xD;
At a sign from the priest all knelt to offer up&#xD;
the solemn prayers of the church.&#xD;
~      5i     ~     *      *      S&#xD;
One circumstance must be noted even at this&#xD;
sacred bedside. As they arose from their knees,&#xD;
the eyes of the young priest chanced to fall on&#xD;
those of Imogene, his hand to touch hers, and&#xD;
every vestige of color vanished froiri her high&#xD;
royal brow, leaving it pallid as marble, while a&#xD;
visible shudder shook her imperial form, tifl it&#xD;
rocked as a storm loosened pillar. The physi-&#xD;
cian drew her arm within his own and led her&#xD;
from the room.&#xD;

CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
THE GRETNA GSLzEN OF ritz OLD DOMINION.&#xD;
They stood, that gentle pair,&#xD;
With the blue heaven of evening above,&#xD;
And forest odors dying on the air,&#xD;
And light leaves trembling round, and early love&#xD;
Deep in each breast. What rocked their souls of&#xD;
strife ?&#xD;
**** rh~y stood that hour,&#xD;
Speaking of hope while mountain, fount, and flower,&#xD;
And star just gleaming through the cedar hough~&#xD;
Seemed holy things as records of their vows;&#xD;
But change came o'er the scene. A hurrying tread&#xD;
Broke on the whispering shades, and then she&#xD;
knew&#xD;
The footstep of her father's wrath that fled&#xD;
Up whence the cedars make you avenue&#xD;
Dim with green twilight; glutting there she caught,&#xD;
Was it the flash of swords? a swift, dark thought&#xD;
Struck down her lips rich crimson as it passed,&#xD;
ADd from her eye the sunny sparkle took&#xD;
'ne moment with its fearfulness, and shook&#xD;
Her slight frame fiercely, as a stormy blast&#xD;
Might shake the rose. Once more and yet once&#xD;
more,&#xD;
She stilled her heart to listen-.-all was o'er!&#xD;
Ilemnns.&#xD;
Except the Falls of Niagara, the Falls of the&#xD;
Shenandoah, at Harper's Ferry, presents perhaps&#xD;
the most awfully sublime prospect in America.&#xD;
The best view is that from the top of the "Pin-&#xD;
nacle," a rugged rock on the Maryland side of&#xD;
the Potomac, towering twelve hundred feet above&#xD;
the rushing river. From the little tongue of&#xD;
land between the two rivers at their juncture,&#xD;
and the two precipices of the mountain at its&#xD;
gap, the emotions arising from the beautiful and&#xD;
sublime in nature are pleasurable to a rapturous&#xD;
-to an ecstatic degree- but such emotions&#xD;
change their nature as the grand becomes the&#xD;
terrific-the terrific stupendous! Few of our&#xD;
people have contempt enough for fatigue, or&#xD;
veneration enough for nature, to dare the labori-&#xD;
ous ascent of the Pinnacle to its highest point;~&#xD;
fewer still have nerve enough to venture to the&#xD;
maddening edge of the tremendous precipice and&#xD;
look down. Something of the wild savage in&#xD;
her nature, that teaching never could tame, nor&#xD;
sorrow quite subdue, tempted oite to the summit&#xD;
of that mountain, and to the very edge of that&#xD;
delirious precipice. At the first fearful look be-&#xD;
low, the whole stupendous scene moved- swam&#xD;
-whirled around, as though from the mountain-&#xD;
top she beheld the whole earth rolling away&#xD;
from beneath her feet; and overwhelmed by the&#xD;
painful, the intolerable sense of the awful fall,&#xD;
had nearly fallen. As soon as this first delirium&#xD;
of the nerves is over, this chaos of th~ mIn4&#xD;
settled, and mountain, glen and torrent&#xD;
each jis ,its place. the grandly expanded.~7 id&#xD;
deepened landscape, the nearly boundless depth&#xD;
and extent, seems as if the whole immense earth&#xD;
&#xD;
SHANN&#xD;
were hollowed out, cup-like, to its very centre&#xD;
and became a measureless green valley with it&#xD;
grand circumference of mountains, upon the ver~&#xD;
edge of the highest of which we stand! Belot~&#xD;
us fall rock after rock, precipice below preci&#xD;
pice, and abyss below abyss of foliage to an in&#xD;
interminable depth, seemingly puasing through&#xD;
the dark centre of the earth itself, and lost it&#xD;
the immensity of space!&#xD;
It is not inspiring-not exalting! Oh! fai&#xD;
from it! It is (lepressit~g! horribly depressing&#xD;
Before tue majesty of soulless matter, the soul-&#xD;
the deatuless-the daring-the immortal! shrink&#xD;
with a shuddering sense of helplessness, ot lost&#xD;
ness! and believes in the possibility of annihila.&#xD;
tion!&#xD;
i'he lower points of this rock are frequent re&#xD;
V sorts of the worshippers of the sublime; but I&#xD;
never he.irdofbuttwo who ascended to the summit&#xD;
and came to the edge of the precipice, and one of&#xD;
the~et.vo registered a vow in heaven, that ii&#xD;

mother earth, never to risk her sanity&#xD;

But Harper's Ferry possesses other points of&#xD;
interest besides the terrific scenery. It is rich&#xD;
in Revolutionary lore and indian tradition and&#xD;
it is, besides, the Gretna Green of Virginia.&#xD;
The reader will recollect that the laws govern-&#xD;
ing the social and domestic relations of Virginia&#xD;
are founded, wherever the difference of position&#xD;
permits, upon those of England. In Virginia, as&#xD;
in England, the marriage of minors, without the&#xD;
consent of their parents and guardians, is ille-&#xD;
I. gal, null and void. Now, though Harper's&#xD;
Ferry is in Virginia, yet it is upon the very&#xD;
boundary river separating that State from Mary-&#xD;
land, and a short distance from the County Court&#xD;
House of Washington County, in the latter State.&#xD;
Hence it is the most convenient place for the&#xD;
purpose, and is the resort of all the indiscreet&#xD;
and disobedient boys and girls of Virginia who&#xD;
choose to cast their fate upon the hazardous die&#xD;
of a rebellious and premature marriage. You&#xD;
would scarcely believe how many of these mar-&#xD;
riages come off every week at that place. So&#xD;
frequent are they that an agent there keeps con-&#xD;
stantly on hand a file of* blank licenses, pur-&#xD;
chased from the County Clerk at Hagerstown,&#xD;
to be filled up when wanted. These marriages&#xD;
take place upon the bridge across the Potomac,&#xD;
beyond the high-water mark. And the State of&#xD;
Maryland annually gains many thousand dollars&#xD;
from the State of Virginia from that one source.&#xD;
At the ti~rie I write of there was no bridge, and&#xD;
the~ preisut hotel did not exist, but on its site&#xD;
was a smaller one, kept by a Mr. Smiie, who~&#xD;
owned the ferry-boat thai plied between it and&#xD;
the opposite shore.&#xD;
It was mere on the. afternoon of a sultry Sop-i&#xD;
&#xD;
ONDALE.                                  45&#xD;
tember day, that a very youthful pair rode in&#xD;
a "hot haste, 'travel-stained, fatigued, and pale,&#xD;
1 up in front of the rural tavern. A hostler came&#xD;
I out to take charge of the horses, and Ardenne,&#xD;
- dismounting, lifted Winny from her saddle.-.-&#xD;
- The host, a dapper little man, with a round&#xD;
and smiling face, came out to meet and con-&#xD;
duct them in.&#xD;
"Is the Reverend Mr. Burleigh at the Ferry?"&#xD;
inquired Ardenne, in a low voice, as he drew&#xD;
the arm of Winny within his own, and led her&#xD;
- into the house.&#xD;
"Yes! yes! he's here!" answered the host,&#xD;
* with a sly smile, and a confidential air.&#xD;
* Now there were really no confidences be-&#xD;
tween Ardenne and the hotel-keeper, to whom&#xD;
* both himself and Winny were perfect strangers;&#xD;
* but the former understood at a glance the state&#xD;
of affairs between the youthful couple, and lent&#xD;
himself to them accordingly.&#xD;
For one minute Winny was left in the par-&#xD;
lor alone, while Ardenne went to procure a&#xD;
small printed slip of paper at the bar. Then&#xD;
returning, he drew her arm within his own, and&#xD;
led her down to the beach, where waited the&#xD;
ferry-boat to convey them across to the Mary-&#xD;
land side.&#xD;
Winny was deadly pale, and looked exhaust-&#xD;
ed, but recognizing Father Burleigh in the boat,&#xD;
her spirits revived br an instant, as she raised&#xD;
and kissed his hand. As they were going over&#xD;
the river, she raised her eyes to his venerable&#xD;
face, so beseechingly !-and murmured-&#xD;
"Oh! Father Burleigh! do you think that&#xD;
we are doing so very wrong 7"&#xD;
"It is over late to ask that question now5&#xD;
Miss Darling!"&#xD;
"True," replied Winny, sadly-and like&#xD;
many dther prospective wrong-doers, she wished&#xD;
the wrong once completed, and the atrua~gte&#xD;
over.&#xD;
They gained the other side-they landed im-&#xD;
mediately under the dizzy heights of the Pin-&#xD;
nacle. They stood before the priest, with the&#xD;
tavern-keeper and the ferryrnan for the witnesses.&#xD;
The book was opened-the imposing ceremony&#xD;
commenced-completed.&#xD;
The boy folded his child-bride to his bosom,&#xD;
and they were turning to leave the place, when&#xD;
the upraised hand and warning voice of the priest&#xD;
arrested them.&#xD;
"I might not refuse to wed you! bu*-sach&#xD;
a marriage seldom, very seldomprospers!&#xD;
and girl you have in your proper selves sinned&#xD;
again the sin of our first parents! You have in&#xD;
your proper persons incurred again the cuasul&#xD;
Son of Adam! in taking this child from her pa-&#xD;
rent's bosom, thou hast plucked again the for-&#xD;

&#xD;
Sorru .s that wait on filial impiety, di-ooeoiei~c&#xD;
and rehellirn!-hotlckarge thee to bear her uj&#xD;
and on throoch th~cn all--"&#xD;
Ardenne clasped Winny more closely to hi&#xD;
heart-&#xD;
"As thou wouldet merit and win a final for&#xD;
giveness from Heaven 1"&#xD;
"At least we shall, together, meet whatever:&#xD;
comes," was the uppermost thought in the heart&#xD;
of both, as they re-entered the ferry-boat.&#xD;
"Poor child, poor child-where do you inten&#xD;
to take her now, Ardenne ?" asked the priest.&#xD;
"We shall remain here to-night-and to-mor.&#xD;
row-Wiany ?" said the youth, suddenly appeal&#xD;
ing to the girl.&#xD;
"'To-morrow,' oh! to-morrow-very, vera&#xD;
early, to-morrow, we must return to Oak Grove&#xD;
must go at once to father and to dearest, dearest&#xD;
grandmother I"&#xD;
They landed on the other side and were walk-&#xD;
ing towards the house, when-suddenly thunder-&#xD;
ing down the hill came a horseman at headlong&#xD;
speed, and Squire Darling throwing himself fran-&#xD;
tically from the saddle, rushed furiouslytowards&#xD;
the party, his face purple, his frame violently&#xD;
shaking with the very frenzy of anger! bran-&#xD;
dishing two swords, and exclaiming,&#xD;
"Thief! kidnapper! villain! scoundrel! tral-&#xD;
~tor! knave! accursed knave! draw and defend&#xD;
your reptile life, that I may not have the sin of&#xD;
murder on my soul !" he hurled one sword at&#xD;
Ardenne with ~o much violence that it must have&#xD;
struck him, but that his Winny, with the in-&#xD;
stinct of devotion and the speed of light, threw&#xD;
herself upon his bosom, receiving upon her own&#xD;
person the blow which felled her bleeding to the&#xD;
earth!&#xD;
"Murderer! you have killed your daughter!"&#xD;
exclaimed the priest, in the extremity of horror.&#xD;
"Devil send I had killed hoth I" roared the&#xD;
madman; white with terror, nevertheless. Ar-&#xD;
denne had sunk down and raised her partly on&#xD;
his lap, laid her falling head upon his bosom, and&#xD;
oh! in a remorse-in a bitter, bitter sorrow, im-&#xD;
possible to describe! impossible to conceive!&#xD;
wac wiping with his handkerchief the blood that&#xD;
oozed from some inward wound from her lips !-&#xD;
while the priest kneeling, laved the young death-&#xD;
like brow and temples with cold water. The&#xD;
frenzy, the dizzy, the blind delirium of his fury&#xD;
having been momentarily shocked away; Squire&#xD;
Darling stood struck statue-still with horror and&#xD;
remorse- an instant-and tben advanced slowly,&#xD;
deprecatingly forward to look in fear upon his&#xD;
work! muttering to himself, "God Almighty&#xD;
knows I did not mean to strike her!"&#xD;
Toe news of the act spread rapidly-" Arrest&#xD;
the murderer! arrest Squire Darling I Arrest&#xD;
&#xD;
e turn! Strike him down if he resists!" sounded&#xD;
p from all sides as the villager- carrie runoiig to&#xD;
the scene of the catastrophe! Disturbe'~ 0y the&#xD;
s noise, Winny opened her gentle eyes, and fixing&#xD;
them tenderly on her father's countenance, mur-&#xD;
- inured faintly,&#xD;
- No-not hurt, I am not-hurt-dear fatner-&#xD;
not much," and then sank exhausted&#xD;
"Arrest Squire Darling! arrest the unnatural&#xD;
monster! knock him on the head if ne resists!,'&#xD;
I thundered the crowd, pouring in, aid a scor~ of&#xD;
hands fell upon the squire. Breaking from ihem&#xD;
- with the strength and fury of an unchained&#xD;
- demon, he roared in a frenzy of remorse, despair&#xD;
and rage:&#xD;
"Fl-I and furies! let me get at him! he has&#xD;
made me kil! my child! let me finish the work&#xD;
by killing him!" and wouldhave fallen with a&#xD;
frantic ferocity upon Ardenne, but that a dozen&#xD;
hands intercepted the raining blows ot his arms,&#xD;
while cries of "Arrest him!" "Knock him&#xD;
down!" "Unnatural monster I,' resounded from&#xD;
'I quarters.&#xD;
At this moment, "Hands off Squire Darling,&#xD;
instantly! and disperse, every one of you, to&#xD;
your homes!" exclaimed a stern, deep toned&#xD;
~"5ce. and Colonel Dangerfield, in the calm&#xD;
majesty of his self-possession and authority,&#xD;
stood in their midst. And, to Squire Darling,&#xD;
who was still struggling violently to get at&#xD;
Ardenne, he said, '- Madman! double murderer!&#xD;
desist, and follow me! your mother, your mother&#xD;
is dying !"&#xD;
Arouied by the sound, the violet eyes ot the&#xD;
mrosTrated girl, once more flew open! She sprang&#xD;
a her feet, stretched out her arms appealingly to&#xD;
olonel Dangerfield, and gasping in heartbreak-&#xD;
ig accents, "No, no! no, no! Oh, God, no!&#xD;
"ot so! not-dying! oh, not dying!" but the&#xD;
lood again gushed from her mouth, and she&#xD;
sank back into the extended arms of the wretched&#xD;
Ardenn0&#xD;
"Bear her to the house at once, Mr. Ardenne.&#xD;
Mr. Smiey, send instantly for a surgeon.&#xD;
Squire t)anl'ng, I believe, I hope your daughter&#xD;
'is not mortally wounded; but your mother is&#xD;
dying; you had best ride, at once, to Oak&#xD;
Grove. Good people all-disperse to your homes&#xD;
-you do no good, but every sort of harm, here I"&#xD;
commanded Colonel Dangerfield, who of all the&#xD;
party was the only one left in possession of his&#xD;
senses. His directions were generally followed.&#xD;
Ardenne, who, struck speechless with despair,&#xD;
had from first to last, never once spoken now&#xD;
moved off with his beloved burden. The squire,&#xD;
frenzied, convulsed, white, foaming and frothy,&#xD;
yet exhausted and nearly idiotic with the effect&#xD;
of the fury of contending passions, mechanically&#xD;
gotinto his saddle.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER Xlii.&#xD;
OAK GRovE.&#xD;
Sec's thou yon gray gleaming hall,&#xD;
Where the deep oak shadows fall?&#xD;
Voices that have left the spot&#xD;
Long ago,&#xD;
Still are murmuring round its hearth,&#xD;
Soft and low:&#xD;
Ever there, yet one alone&#xD;
Hath the gift to hear their tone.&#xD;
Gue~i~ come thither and depart,&#xD;
Fiec of' step and light of hcart;&#xD;
(Thildren, with sweet Visions blest,&#xD;
In the haunted chambers rest;&#xD;
One alone unslninbering lies,&#xD;
When the night hath sealed all eyes;&#xD;
One quick heart and watchful ear,&#xD;
Listening for those whispers clear.&#xD;
Hemans.&#xD;
A year, with its moral and its atmospherical&#xD;
vicissitudes-with its toils and struggles-its&#xD;
hopes and fears-its disappointments and vic-&#xD;
tories-its sins and sorrows-its loves and joys&#xD;
-a year, with its fruitful autumn, its hoary&#xD;
[ winter, its budding, blooming spring, and its&#xD;
exuberant luxuriance of summer-has passed&#xD;
since the warm eve in September when Winny&#xD;
Darling gave herself to Edgar Ardenne.&#xD;
Let us first take a glance at Oak Grove. Mrs.&#xD;
Darling, the old lady, whom we left prostrate on&#xD;
what we supposed to be her death- bed, did not,&#xD;
nevertheless, die then or there, nor did she yet&#xD;
fully recover. That strong, unyielding, invinci-&#xD;
ble tenacity of vitality which distinguishes some&#xD;
r organizations, successfully resisted death, and&#xD;
she lived; but what a wreck of her former self I&#xD;
more welcome, less appalling must have been&#xD;
death! She lived, and sat confined to her arm&#xD;
chair, in her own lonely and solitary chamber,&#xD;
paralyzed in mind and body-nothing but the&#xD;
loving heart left living in its pristine, in its im-&#xD;
mortal strength!&#xD;
"Where is Winny? Send Winny to me! I&#xD;
want Winny I" she would pleadingly say to Sina&#xD;
Hinton, who, with her diabolical cunning, had&#xD;
contrived to get the chief charge and control of&#xD;
the unfortunate lady.&#xD;
"Yes, yes, we will send for her; you shall see&#xD;
her!" Sina would reply.&#xD;
"But when, when," with a child-like perti-&#xD;
nacity she would entreat.&#xD;
"Oh, to-morrow; you shall see Winny to-&#xD;
morrow I" would be the reply of the guileful&#xD;
girl, thinking, perhaps, that the old lady would&#xD;
forget; but, no, her heart never forgot! In the&#xD;
,morning she would be sure to wake early, and&#xD;
insist on being dressed soon, and sit in her arm-&#xD;
chair, for, "Winny is coming to-day I" she&#xD;
would say to her old waiting-maid, and the poor&#xD;
old servant, not knowing that her lady had been&#xD;
deceived by a promise, and thinking that in that&#xD;
&#xD;
also her mine wandered, would go out to weep&#xD;
over the ruined intellect 05 her old, old compa-&#xD;
nion and mistress of nearly three-quarters of a&#xD;
century. And as the hours pasasi' and the day&#xD;
advanced, the invalid would look- and watch,&#xD;
and inquire, and weep-and sometimes, with a&#xD;
prophetic glimpse of the truth, she would say-&#xD;
her very errors of speech making her lamenta-&#xD;
tions more pathetic-&#xD;
"Oh, I shall see Winny never no more! never&#xD;
no more I"&#xD;
She knew Sina Hinton perfectly; for, as her&#xD;
intellect weakened, her instincts became more&#xD;
subtle.&#xD;
"Send that girl away !" she would say to her&#xD;
son, in the very presence of Sina, "she makes&#xD;
misery!"&#xD;
But Sina Hinton-sweet, considerate, forgiving&#xD;
soul !-would go to her, and coo and caress,&#xD;
while the old lady would shrink in loathing from&#xD;
her contact.&#xD;
"What an angel of goodness you are, Miss&#xD;
Hinton! And, oh, my poor mother, what a&#xD;
wreck! what a wreck! and to think that she&#xD;
should injure you so, Sina! sweet, soft SinaI&#xD;
but never mind, my darling girl! sole comfort&#xD;
of my afflictions! my console! my beautiful&#xD;
console! Never mind! bear this a little longer!&#xD;
do not leave me! Oh, Sina, how shall I ever&#xD;
repay you, my best, best girl, for all your self-&#xD;
devotion in staying here? but never mind, Sina,&#xD;
you shall be rewarded-richly rewarded,- A~r&#xD;
George! shall you !" the squire would exclaim,&#xD;
with enthusiastic gratitude.&#xD;
Thus the instincts, the inspirations of the old&#xD;
lady were neglected as the senseless gibberish&#xD;
of dotage, while the falsities of the doubly-dyed&#xD;
traitress were received as so much holiness and&#xD;
truth. Her intuition soon divined the influence&#xD;
this fatal girl possessed with her son-the ascen-&#xD;
dency she was gradually gaining over him; and&#xD;
daily would she bow her pure heart before this&#xD;
polluted power, and plead for her she loved.&#xD;
"Send for Winny! Let Winny come home-&#xD;
and take the rest! that is all I want in this&#xD;
world! Winny home !" and daily the deceitful&#xD;
girl would promise that "Winny shall come to-&#xD;
inorrow"-and daily that promise would be&#xD;
broken, and the sad plaint would recur, "Oh! I&#xD;
shall never see Winny again! never no more!"&#xD;
But the words do npt suggest the tone of deep&#xD;
despair in which they were uttered. Thus day&#xD;
after day, in sickening "ho~.e deterred," lingered&#xD;
this loving and suffering heart zWho cars guess&#xD;
the 'torture-the anguish of this soul. feeling&#xD;
most poignantly all the sorrows of a bereave-&#xD;
ment she could yet neither understand nor cure.&#xD;
She seemed once to feel that Winny was suffer-&#xD;
ing from poverty-not from hearing any nine san.&#xD;
so, for the name of the lost daughter&#xD;
"Was banished from each lip and ear,&#xD;
Like words of wantonness or tear,"&#xD;

subject of the lost daughter, that had been&#xD;
sternly enforced upon every other member of the&#xD;
family.&#xD;
Sina Hinton! more than any other evil cha-&#xD;
racter it has been my fate to portray, I detest&#xD;
Sina Hinton I We admire the fierce beauty and&#xD;
strength of the lion and the tiger, even when&#xD;
shunning their destroying fury; but we loathe&#xD;
the slime of the serpent even more than we&#xD;
fear the venom of its fangs. Sina Hinton played&#xD;
her part as she knew how to play it-artfully&#xD;
intercepting all lel ! ers and messages, and skill-&#xD;
fully preventing all interviews that promised the&#xD;
most distant hope of a reconciliation; and withal&#xD;
making herself so necessary to all the family,&#xD;
as to draw from tin reserved and dignified Mrs.&#xD;
Summerfield the frequent commendation of-&#xD;
"Miss Hinton, my brother and myself can never&#xD;

CHAPTER XLV.&#xD;
whAT LOVE IN A COTTAGh 15 SOMETIMES LIES.&#xD;
Patience and sorrow strive&#xD;
Which shall express her goodliest.&#xD;
Slsakspeare.&#xD;
Winny Darling had been brought up with even&#xD;
more tenderness than Southern girls usually&#xD;
are-a grandmother's pet from earliest infancy--&#xD;
an only ghild of his idolized and lost wife, a fa..&#xD;
thor's half-worshipped darling-the heiress be.&#xD;
sides of an Immense fortune-Winay had been&#xD;
surrounded $pm babyhood with a love and an&#xD;
observance that had guarded her from even the&#xD;
5&#xD;
&#xD;
idea of inconvenience of any sort, much less from&#xD;
hardship. ~o much love-and I had almost said&#xD;
reverence, paid to a child naturally less amiable&#xD;
than Winny wos~d have spoiled her disposition,&#xD;
as it spoiled her ability. In her father's house&#xD;
Miss Darilug had been wakened by her maid&#xD;
every morning at seven o'clock to take her bath.&#xD;
Then while sitting at her ease, her hair had been&#xD;
combed out and curled, and her shoes and stock-&#xD;
ings put on, and afterward her morning toilet&#xD;
completed without a thought or an act of her&#xD;
own in the matter. Old Nerve had washed and&#xD;
dressed her "little missed" when she was six&#xD;
day. old, and she continued to do it when she was&#xD;
sixteen yenrs without a thought of ceasing. Her&#xD;
grandmother, too, had expressed an opinion that&#xD;
it was much better for a young maiden likeMiss&#xD;
Darling to have an old, faithful and attached&#xD;
dressing-maid, than a young and thoughtless one&#xD;
as ignorant as herself. So Nerve had remained&#xD;
in her service, petting and spoiling her to her&#xD;
heart's content, and guarding her as carefully&#xD;
from learning to think or act for herself, as she&#xD;
would have shielded her from war, pestilence, or&#xD;
famine. Winny's rooms, wardrobe, books, mu-&#xD;
sic, pictures, etc., were kept in order; and her&#xD;
walks, rides, baths, etc., arranged without a&#xD;
single volition of her own will in the matter. It&#xD;
was one of the "thirty-nine articles" of their re-&#xD;
ligious creed to love and nerve Miss Darling. Or&#xD;
if Winny did any little voluntary bit of work, it&#xD;
was some unnecessary trifle to which her altec-&#xD;
tionate heart alone would prompt her-such as&#xD;
displacing her grandmother's maid, for the sake&#xD;
of bathing, rubbing and caressing the old lady'~&#xD;
feet, or doing the duty of her father's body ser-&#xD;
vaint by mixing his mint-julep, and setting him&#xD;
to swearing by spoiling it! Upon such occa-.&#xD;
sions hewantedto know whatthe mischief waste&#xD;
use of his having half a thousand of lazy negroes,.&#xD;
if his daughter had to wait upon him like a foot-&#xD;
boy-he wanted to know, for instance, what wae&#xD;
the utility of anybody having dogs and barking&#xD;
themselves? And if Winny put in any sweet, af~&#xD;
fectionate word about the duty and the pleasure of&#xD;
waiting on her father, he would call it iomantic&#xD;
rubbish, and say that things were adapted to&#xD;
uses, and uses to things, and that to put Winny&#xD;
Darling to mixing toddy-was about as wise as to&#xD;
take one of her own silk scarfs to wipe tumblers&#xD;
with. lam sorry to acknowledge it-but as there&#xD;
is necessity upon me to speak and write the truth&#xD;
without idealizing-it must be 'confessed that&#xD;
these instances betray more innate vulgarity&#xD;
than chivalric feeling in the pride of our fat and&#xD;
fair-haired squire.&#xD;
Madam Winifred, with all her refinement, fully&#xD;
appreciated the religious sentiment in Winny's&#xD;
love and proffered services, though she veuld&#xD;
sometimes say to her-&#xD;
"There are other and more useful ways of ro.&#xD;

&#xD;
dealing affection, my own darling, than by these&#xD;
menial services that any other might do as well."&#xD;
"Ah, but, grandmother, don't you know that&#xD;
the more humble a service is, the deeper the plea-&#xD;
sure it gives me? When I am sitting on the&#xD;
floor bathing your dear, white feet, grandmother,&#xD;
or when I am combing out your long, soft hair-&#xD;
1 have a fueling if profound content as when I&#xD;
hush my heart and bow my head to receive the&#xD;
priest's benedicite."&#xD;
And sometimes in a lighter mood she would&#xD;
say-&#xD;
"Indeed, grandmother, you would let me be&#xD;
your little waiting-maid, if you only believed&#xD;
what an hourly satisfaction, what a real sub-&#xD;
stantial earthly bread and meat satisfaction it&#xD;
would be to me 1 It is such a starvation of the&#xD;
heart to keep my hands away from any one I&#xD;
love; and it is such a down-right heartfelt content&#xD;
-such a feast to be fingering about them."&#xD;
But I have been led too far from the point of&#xD;
time. Now all was changed with Winny. She&#xD;
had fallen, smote down to the earth by the sud-&#xD;
den news that her beloved grandmother was&#xD;
dying ;-fainting from the loss of blood, she had&#xD;
been carried into the small tavern and laid upon&#xD;
an humble bed in a hot, close little room, which&#xD;
was nevertheless the best one in the house.&#xD;
When restoratives were applied, and she re-&#xD;
covered from one faintisig fit with renewed rea-&#xD;
son and memory, it was only to fall into another&#xD;
and more dangerous one. Indeed the physician&#xD;
said that it was only the free bleeding at the&#xD;
lungs, dangerous though it was, and the extreme&#xD;
physical prostration caused thereby, together&#xD;
with the counter irritation, that preserved her&#xD;
brain and saved her reason from a total and&#xD;
final overthrow I Thus for weeks she lay alter-&#xD;
nating between death-like swoons, and short con-&#xD;
9iilsi've spasms of life, of keenest anguish and&#xD;
remorse!&#xD;
And all this time Ardenne, in the bitterness&#xD;
of a sorrow and repentance scarcely lese than&#xD;
her own, watched by her bedside; nor night&#xD;
nor day, for an hour, resigned his post-while&#xD;
flesh and health and strength passed from him&#xD;
unnoticed, until he grew as thin, as pale, and&#xD;
almost as feeble as the wan, wan form languish-&#xD;
ing, withering before him. Was it a really sin-&#xD;
cere repentance then? Did they indeed wish&#xD;
that their error could be blotted out-the ill-&#xD;
starred marriage under the rock could be an-&#xD;
nulled, and each restored-she to her family, he&#xD;
to his freedom? No! no! no! by all the mu-&#xD;
tual anguish, by all the remorse that only served&#xD;
to kiiit their hearts more closely together-no!&#xD;
Each felt in the first calmly conscious meeting&#xD;
of their eyes, 'each felt more than ever now, in&#xD;
this season of bitter trial-that were the whole&#xD;
past to be lived over, the error would be com-&#xD;
mitted, the anguish risked again! No! no! no-&#xD;
thing but the hopeless, the impossible defection&#xD;
&#xD;
of one, or of the other, could have brought either&#xD;
to wish their act annulled. Yet Squire Darling,&#xD;
quoting the familiar proverb, "When poverty&#xD;
comes in at the door, love flies out at the win.&#xD;
dow," hoped and believed that their attachment&#xD;
would in a few weeks, or months, be starved, Os&#xD;
frozen, or fatigued out. And it may be so with&#xD;
a hasty, fanciful and factitious sentiment, a tin-&#xD;
sel counterfeit of the pure gold of affection-but&#xD;
theirs, with all the sin and sorrow it had caused,&#xD;
was nevertheless, deep, earnest and true-may&#xD;
their patience and fidelity atone for and redeem&#xD;
them! Their honey-moon was not that of ro-&#xD;
mantic young lovers-though be it remembered&#xD;
both were vry young, he nineteen,~ she sixteen.&#xD;
No! it had been passed in agony of body and&#xD;
anguish of mind, prostrate upon a bed of extreme&#xD;
illness by Winny, and in constant, fatiguing sor-&#xD;
rowful and remorseful watching by Ardenne!&#xD;
But they were unselfish, disinterested, devoted&#xD;
-and this sorrow endeared them to each other&#xD;
more, oh, how much more than weeks passed in&#xD;
health and revelry. Every care he lavished&#xD;
upon the languishing one-every fatigue he in-&#xD;
dured for her sake, but deepened his affection for&#xD;
her-but riveted his attachment to her. "I&#xD;
am proving what the inspired angel mid," he&#xD;
thought, "I am proving that bodily pain and&#xD;
fatigue, without moral suffering, endured for a&#xD;
loved one, is a deep, religious joy-with and for&#xD;
moral suffering, it is an alleviation, or cure!"&#xD;
Her suffering, his devotion, their youth and&#xD;
beauty and warm affection, drew around them&#xD;
the sympathies of all the small town; yes! the&#xD;
sympathies even of the cold-hearted gathered&#xD;
around their loves, as the shivering dr~iw-around&#xD;
a warm hearth for its pleasant heat. Of course&#xD;
the whole story was known. And I am afraid&#xD;
Squire Darling's conduct and character suffered&#xD;
more severe animadversion than was strictly&#xD;
just. The two best physicians of the county,&#xD;
Doctors Tidball and Lackland, attended her, yet&#xD;
both declared that all their science would have&#xD;
been powerless to have saved her life, had it not&#xD;
been for the constant, the vigilant, the untiring&#xD;
care of Ardenne, and the inspired tact, amount..&#xD;
ing almost to a sixth sense, with which he in-&#xD;
stantly detected the mutations and crisis of hat&#xD;
illness. With all this care her life was saved,&#xD;
but it was four weeks before it was deemed safe&#xD;
to tell her any news that might startle or sur-&#xD;
prise. At last, about the first of October, she&#xD;
was told that her grandmother still lived-that&#xD;
though paralyzed, there was no immediate fear of&#xD;
her death. But, oh! could Winny rejoice in&#xD;
that spared life, with that shattered frame, and&#xD;
ruined mind? Her slow, extremely slow con-&#xD;
valescence, was passed in penitential tears and&#xD;
prayers, alas! so inconsistently! for a fault she&#xD;
felt she should commit again, were the tempta-&#xD;
tion again before her. But perhaps Winny&#xD;
prayed, as I am afraid too many of us do quite&#xD;
&#xD;
unconsciOusly pray; namely-to be forgiven, to&#xD;
be remitted the just punishment of the sin, not&#xD;
to be cleansed from the dear sin itself! And for&#xD;
Ardenne, it did seem too severe-it would have&#xD;
~ wearied out any one less patient than himself,&#xD;
4 to find that after all his devotion to her, after all&#xD;
his nigiits and days of extreme fatigue and aux-&#xD;
iety, that after his almost miraclons res'ora-&#xD;
tion of her life-her convalescence should be&#xD;
passed in weeping and ~ailing; but he .ever&#xD;
thought of that! never, nesnr grew tired of try-&#xD;
ing to soothe, to console her. Thus passed tue&#xD;
second month of their marriage.&#xD;
it was the first ~f Noveriber before she was&#xD;
able to leave her room. She wrote to tier father&#xD;
~ imploring his forgiveness-imploring perm tssicn&#xD;
only to come and see her poor, dear grandmother.&#xD;
To this letter she received this curt and sharp&#xD;
reply.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
A&#xD;
&#xD;
"When you have bidden a final farewell to the&#xD;
accursed hireling knave who stole his master's&#xD;
daughter from his house-when you have sworn&#xD;
never to see, speak to, or write to tAm, or re-&#xD;
ceive any letter or message from him-when in&#xD;
short, you part with him as with the dea -then,&#xD;
and not till then, shall you enter my house! You&#xD;
need send no more letters, fo 1 s ad re-pig to&#xD;
none not prefaced with the surrender of th- d-d&#xD;
footman you have married. You kno~' tre terms,&#xD;
andyon know me- JARED DARLING"&#xD;
Ardenne and Winny were sitting gather&#xD;
when this cruel letter came. She read it, and&#xD;
the sudden, deep despair that struck all color&#xD;
from her very lips, revealed to Ardenne the death&#xD;
of her hopes. Winny looked at him, and held&#xD;
the letter towards the fire.&#xD;
"Yes! burn it, darling !" said Ardenne, di-&#xD;
vining her embarrassment; and she let it go&#xD;
into the blaze, and dropp~ d herself into the kind&#xD;
arms opened to receive her. Not a word more&#xD;
was said about the letter.&#xD;
"Winny, love I we must leave this place, do&#xD;
you not know it?"&#xD;
"Oh, yesl"&#xD;
"There are two plans, Winny, that I have to&#xD;
propose to you. The first is, that -ye shall go to&#xD;
the Western country-to begin life with a new&#xD;
territory, a young couple a young State, and&#xD;
grow with it Tuere. Wina', should not dread&#xD;
a failure in a competition itli the strongest!&#xD;
A few years of heslthfut toil, and then a bril-&#xD;
liant future !" and for the first time since their&#xD;
ill opened mar' sage. us eyes sparkled as he spoke.&#xD;
And the other plan, Edgar?"&#xD;
Is this, my darling-To stay here yet a&#xD;
few years. and meet what threatens; for I think,&#xD;
Winnv, that you would grieve to desert the&#xD;
ee~gtbor~'ood, while your good and suffe-ring&#xD;
grand nether still lives; you would grieve to&#xD;
leave her ill an suffering, with the certainty of&#xD;
never seeing her again 1"&#xD;
&#xD;
51&#xD;
&#xD;
-- But, Edgar! I could not, upon that account,&#xD;
blight all your future life! Now ould sne ad-&#xD;
vise-grandmother, herself, would not counsel&#xD;
me to do it."&#xD;
"Love! love! I am not twenty, yet-itaying&#xD;
here a few years, would not 'blight' all my fu.&#xD;
ture life-while leaving tier now, might sadden&#xD;
all yours It is that I would avert, Winny. - -&#xD;
"Ardenne! will you do as you please-being&#xD;
sure that I shall know it to be altogether&#xD;
right?"&#xD;
"But I would have your counsel, Winny."&#xD;
"Ah! I wish I could assist you with my&#xD;
thoughts-but I have no knowledge of the world,&#xD;
you hOow."&#xD;
"Your thoughts are purer-your counsel really&#xD;
wiser for that, my love-knowledge of the world&#xD;
is oftentimes a gambler's knowledge of tricks&#xD;
at cards-and we do not wish to enter life as a&#xD;
game, dear; so give me your honest thoughts."&#xD;
'-Oh, but Edgar! m- judgment is not good"&#xD;
"You have been told so, dear, until you be-&#xD;
lieve it! Whoever could have taught you so,&#xD;
dear? you must not set out by being perenaded&#xD;
that you have a poor judgment, anc then let it&#xD;
grow really imbecile for want of exercise- In&#xD;
this march of life, Ido not wish 'o goon in advance&#xD;
alone, selfishly laying out the future and turning&#xD;
to consort with you, only in hours of idleness&#xD;
and relaxation No! I love you too entirely-&#xD;
too wholly; we must be one in mind, as in&#xD;
heart; I would have you go step by step with&#xD;
me-if you fail to come up, I must fall back.&#xD;
Now to return to this subject, Winny, we must&#xD;
decide it soon. What is your opinion ?"&#xD;
" Dear Edgar; can I take the responsibility&#xD;
of advising you when inclination so strongly&#xD;
biases the little judgtnent I have-"&#xD;
"And this inclination, Winny; I divine it.&#xD;
In a word, it was settled between them that&#xD;
they should remain in the neighborhood for the&#xD;
present. And then he drew a small table to the&#xD;
tire, between them, and said,&#xD;
"Now, dear, let us see what we have to com-&#xD;
mence with," and taking out his purse~ one that&#xD;
Winny had knit for him, he turned its 'onteats&#xD;
upon the board-" Nineteen dollars." He wrote&#xD;
down that sum, and then taking his watch,&#xD;
chain and pencil, placed them with the money-&#xD;
"They cost two hundred dollars-they will&#xD;
bring half price ;" he wrote down one hundred.&#xD;
A seal ring drawn from his little finger was&#xD;
added to the pile, and "ten dollars" added to&#xD;
the list. Then ~ very small diamond broach,&#xD;
which he valued at fifteen dollars, completed the&#xD;
sum. And Winny drew from her finger a small&#xD;
ring, a ruby heart, set around with pearls, and&#xD;
laid it with the others, sax ing,&#xD;
"That is all I have; I never carried a purse&#xD;
of money, or a watch and chain, never having&#xD;

had use for either; but that little ring is valu-&#xD;
able, I think, as a ring."&#xD;
And Ardenne silently took it up, and would&#xD;
have replaced it on the small finger, but with a&#xD;
smile she stopped him, pointing to the third&#xD;
finger of her left hand, 8he said.&#xD;
"See I I have still another ring! a dearer ring,&#xD;
that shall never leave my finger!"&#xD;
"We have about a hundred and fifty dollars&#xD;
then, dear."&#xD;
"Oh! I have more jewelry at home, a great&#xD;
deal more-a complete set of pearls and a com-&#xD;
plete set of sapphires-I wonder if I were to&#xD;
send for my wardrobe, if father would Bend them&#xD;
to me?"&#xD;
"Do not send for them, Winny."&#xD;
"And then there is my-little Sea Foam-a&#xD;
small fortune to you and me."&#xD;
"lie must be returned to your father's&#xD;
stables, dear. It should have been done long&#xD;
ago, but I waited to speak to you on the sub-&#xD;
ject."&#xD;
"But why? why ?-he was purchased for&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"For your tese, dear; you were a minor; you&#xD;
owned nothing-not your palfrey-not your&#xD;
jewelry."&#xD;
"Still, if we send Sea Foam home, my father&#xD;
will send him back, since no one wants him&#xD;
there; and it my father happens to think of my&#xD;
wardrobe, books, piano, and all my little per-&#xD;
sonal effects, he will be sure to send them, for&#xD;
he may be furious and destroying, but not mean&#xD;
in his revenge."&#xD;
"I shall be glad for your sake then, dear&#xD;
Winny."&#xD;
That same evening Ardenne hired a man to&#xD;
take back Sea Foam to Oak Grove. He himself&#xD;
get in the stage and rode to Winchester, to diu-&#xD;
pose of their jewelry, which, contrary to his cx&#xD;
pectations, brought them nearly two hundred&#xD;
dollars. With that he returned to Winny, and&#xD;
to settle their debts that had remained unpaid up&#xD;
to this time.&#xD;
Then it was that Ardenne tasted for the first&#xD;
time one of the "sweets" of adversity, in find-&#xD;
ing how much goodness, how much simple gene-&#xD;
rosity, and guileless, unconscious magnanimity,&#xD;
may exist among the roughest and most unpre-&#xD;
tending of our fellow creatures. First he called&#xD;
for the host and his bill, and the little, fat&#xD;
landlord, with his round, baby face and simple&#xD;
manner, entered the parlor.&#xD;
"I have to apologize for not asking for, and&#xD;
settling my bill before, Mr. Smiley-but----well!&#xD;
Mrs. Ardenne and myself leave you to-day, and&#xD;
so I wish to settle with you now."&#xD;
Now this little, round landlord had a bad name&#xD;
in the county-a thriftless, good-for-nothing fel-&#xD;
low, always in debt, always behind hand, never&#xD;
quite sober-though never altogether drunk. At&#xD;
this moment he had not five dollars in his tili,&#xD;
&#xD;
I N DALE.&#xD;
for, be it remembered that Harper's Ferry was&#xD;
not then the great railway thoroughfare that it&#xD;
15 now, nor did it boast the comfortable and well&#xD;
kept hotel that now marks the site where then&#xD;
stood the little tavern, kept by the little land-&#xD;
lord, Sammy Smiley, the brother of the priest's&#xD;
housekeeper.&#xD;
"Have you the bill about you, sir ?"&#xD;
The little host sat down in a chair, drew up&#xD;
his feet, rubbed and 8troked his little, fat knees,&#xD;
and-smiled. Ardenne was standing before him,&#xD;
pocket-book in hand, enacting patronizing wealth.&#xD;
"The bill, if you please, sir-- we are hurried"&#xD;
"The bill! oh-aye-yes, to be sure! the bill&#xD;
-I-l'v~ mislaid it some where-it-it's lost-&#xD;
some other time !"&#xD;
"Can't you recollect the amount, sir 7"&#xD;
"The amount! oh! yes, certainly, the&#xD;
amount was-was-it's gone clean out of my&#xD;
head! 'pon my word, I don't know what the&#xD;
amount was-any other time will do as well I"&#xD;
"Be so good as to make it out again, if you&#xD;
please, sir."&#xD;
"I-I--.l haint time-indeed, indeed I haint I"&#xD;
said the landlord, with awkward embarrassment,&#xD;
yet looking so lovingly at the poor young phiu-&#xD;
as if his little lymphatic body were about to deli-&#xD;
quesce in tears.&#xD;
"It will take you but a moment, Mr. Smi-&#xD;
icy!"&#xD;
"But I haint that moment to spare I indeed,&#xD;
indeed I haint! I'm very busy-I'm-i'm awfully&#xD;
pushed with work! I - I 'dare to heaven,&#xD;
I am!" persisted the landlord, looking, in every&#xD;
soft curve of his gentle face and frame, the very&#xD;
image of an easy mind and infinite leisure!-&#xD;
Ardenne could not fail to understand his simple&#xD;
hypocrisies now. He seized his little, chubby&#xD;
hand, and pressing it fervently, said,&#xD;
"Smiley, mydear friend, I see your motive,&#xD;
and from the bottom of my heart thank you for&#xD;
your kindness; but you know, my good fellow,&#xD;
I cannot, with any sort of self-respect-'&#xD;
Here the little host broke in, blushing like a&#xD;
school-boy detected in lying, and exclaimed,&#xD;
"Oh, my dear sir? Mr. Ardenne! 1 hadn't&#xD;
such a thought! I insult a gentleman in that&#xD;
way, because he is a little unfortunate, or so?-&#xD;
never!&#xD;
"My good friend, I am not inssdted.-whatg&#xD;
be insulted at your generous goodness, however&#xD;
[mistaken it might be? In my turn, I say-never!&#xD;
peak, Winny! speak, darling! for I see your&#xD;
glowing, and your eyes full.of sweet tears."&#xD;
"I wanted to say," said Winny, taking the&#xD;
host's other chubby hand between her own deli-&#xD;
cate ones, "I wanted, so much, to 'say, that we&#xD;
should have more than the wickedness of Luci-&#xD;
fer's own pride to get offended at your goodness,&#xD;
when we ought to be, and we are, very grateful.&#xD;
We shall never, never forget all your kindness&#xD;
to us," said she, very softly', with tears in her&#xD;

cheek flushed deeply, and so great was the pat-&#xD;
pitation of tier heart, ttiat he felt the veins and&#xD;
nerves of the small arm resting on his own, throb&#xD;
and tremble violently, and he reproached him-&#xD;
self severely for suffering her to walk. Yet&#xD;
carriages and horses were very expensive, and&#xD;
economy must commence some time.&#xD;
"Winny, sit down here, dear, and rest a&#xD;
while," tie said, and arranged taer seat under a&#xD;
tree upon the side of the hill. with some broken&#xD;
pieces of rock, seated her carefully, and sitting&#xD;
by tier side, put his arm around her waist, and&#xD;
drawing her head down on his bosom, looked&#xD;
into her sweet wan face With such intense, ab-&#xD;
sorbing interest, as to seem, for a while, quite&#xD;
lost in the breathless contemplation How&#xD;
faded, how broken she looked already! Oh. she&#xD;
was dying like a plucked dower on his bosom,&#xD;
and he c~iuld never survive her, he thought.-&#xD;
Winny's sweet eyes, upturned to his, read the&#xD;
poor boy's thought, and she replied, softly&#xD;
smiling-&#xD;
"Do not be uneasy about me, dear Edgar 1-&#xD;
You know people recovering from illness are&#xD;
always weak I am ashamed of my long-con-&#xD;
tinued weakness, and shall try to grow strong.&#xD;
I am gaining strength every day-"&#xD;
Here she was interrupted by that slight, but&#xD;
constantly recurring cough.&#xD;
"This will not do, either, dear; the dews are&#xD;
beginning to fall, and you will take cold," said&#xD;
ne, and alter looking at her a moment with a&#xD;
faint smile, he stooped suddenly, and before she&#xD;
could object, raised her light form in his arms,&#xD;
and bore her up the hill. Arrived at the top, he&#xD;
put her down, and drawing her arm again within&#xD;
his own, they resumed their walk.&#xD;
"At least, now, there are some things, and&#xD;
they are the best things, too, that poverty cannot&#xD;
deprive us of, Edgar! Oh, Edgar! if it were&#xD;
not for-" and here she stopped, as if unwilling&#xD;
to sadden him uselessly, by an allusion to their&#xD;
mutual and irreparable error,-and here, too,&#xD;
she made a silent resolution never to trouble&#xD;
film again with her remorse.&#xD;
"What were you saying, love ?"&#xD;
"I say, Edgar, that the wealth, ease, &amp;amp;nd&#xD;
luxury which we have lost, are nothing in com-&#xD;
parison to the blessings that yet remain to us.&#xD;
Come 1-can we count them up? Youth, health,&#xD;
hope, intelligence and good looks, (let us be&#xD;
frank with each other,) and our mutual love ;-&#xD;
that to begin with! Then our little house, small&#xD;
and rude as it is, is alone, us on the ridge, where&#xD;
the air is so light and pure! and the water so&#xD;
crystal clear and cold! I do not know whether&#xD;
it is because my lungs are extremely delicate&#xD;
and sensitive, or not, but I find a ereat differ-&#xD;
ence between valley air and mountain air ;-I&#xD;
find mountain air so e.i~y o breathe! so light,&#xD;
thin, dry and inflating! In valley air, I detect a&#xD;
humidity and heaviness, even in dry weather. I&#xD;
&#xD;
N D A L E.&#xD;
alts aye tele so light, and elastic, and cheerful o~&#xD;
the mountains! Ia comparison to what I felt ii&#xD;
the valley. I always said that I had rather live&#xD;
in a plain house on the mountain, than a fine C~&#xD;
one in the valley. And then, too, I love tie&#xD;
grand old gray rocks, and the great mounuaji&#xD;
pines I I have a feeling towards them iik.~ rat&#xD;
I have towards good, wise and strong old folk,'&#xD;
-a sense of protection, shelter and safety near&#xD;
them 1-it is fancy, but it is a pleasant--n~y, a&#xD;
comfortable feeling. So you see, Eugar, you&#xD;
couldn't have suited me better than by settling&#xD;
on toe ridge-I always had an instinctive eonvic.&#xD;
tion that! required mountain air and wate~ to 4&#xD;
make me a strong girl-and if it had not been ~&#xD;
for this wound," here she stopped suddenly, again&#xD;
reproaching herself that she had been hurried&#xD;
into aii allusion to her father's violence.&#xD;
This was the very first time that she had&#xD;
ever hinted the subject. and now she was agi.&#xD;
tats-d at having inadvertently done so But&#xD;
Ardenne grew pale, stopped, and while one&#xD;
atm passed around her little waist supported&#xD;
her, the ot~ier hand was l8id upon the left side&#xD;
of her bosom-and looking earnestly into her&#xD;
face, he inquired, very seriously-&#xD;
"Winny, dear, tell me, and tell me truth-&#xD;
this wound of yours !-there is no outward sign&#xD;
of its existence remaining-but-do you feel it&#xD;
still?"&#xD;
Winny remained silent, her cheek flushed, she&#xD;
looked down.&#xD;
" Tell me, Winny."&#xD;
"Edgar I"&#xD;
"Nay, dear, you must tell me! It us post&#xD;
tively necessary that you do, love I-say does&#xD;
that wound still continue to hurt you I"&#xD;
I&#xD;
Yes"&#xD;
Ardenne became very much agitated; it was&#xD;
with the utmost effort at self-control, that he&#xD;
could.speak steadily.&#xD;
"How ?-tell me all about it, my love."&#xD;
"Well, then, it is always burning, burning, as&#xD;
if a small coal of fire was there-it is that&#xD;
which flushes up my left cheek ~&#xD;
Ardenne suppressed a heavy groan.&#xD;
'And when you draw a long breath, Winny,&#xD;
does it hurt you more ?"&#xD;
"Yes I when I cough, or raise my voice, or&#xD;
draw a long breath, a sharp, burning pain darts&#xD;
from that spot, and scatters all over my chest,&#xD;
and flushes up my cheek."&#xD;
The suppressed groan now burst forth in&#xD;
agony.&#xD;
Don't grieve, Edgar 1-dear Edgar, don':,&#xD;
please don't-it is a worse anguish to see you&#xD;
grieve; besides, I know how to prevent this&#xD;
pain!"&#xD;
"Ifow, dear I"&#xD;

"Come, come, aunty! come, my good soul&#xD;

her to sit down in one of the chairs.&#xD;

"You pretend to love that child, and yet see&#xD;

"But how did you know about our plans,&#xD;

"Why you see, sir, I quiress of every one I&#xD;

see, Marse Edgar, I nussed her-"&#xD;
And while she talked the old woman went on&#xD;
arranging the table, filled up the tea-pot, set it&#xD;
on the waiter, put on the plate of toast and set&#xD;
two chairs to the table, and as Edgar led Winny&#xD;
to the head of the table, old Nerve took her place&#xD;
at the back, as she had been acc~tstomed to stand&#xD;
at the hack of her master's chair at the head of&#xD;
the table at Oak Grove. After supper Nerve&#xD;
took the tea things out and washed them up and&#xD;
replaced them in the cupboard. Then, as it was&#xD;
growing dark, she closed the shutters, let down&#xD;
the paper blinds, mended the fire, lighted a can-&#xD;
dle and placed it on the table between Winny&#xD;
and Edgar, and then said,&#xD;
"Now, Miss Winny, honey! it's time fur me&#xD;

"No, Nerve! that must not he! Father would&#xD;

you must do noViing without his knowledge !"&#xD;
"Now, Miss Wiany, see here! you think I&#xD;

"No, Nerve, you must riot! we are much&#xD;

you must not offend Squire Darling by coming&#xD;

"Kik.kik-kik! (laughing) You.dem think I&#xD;

"Miss Sina Hinton does."&#xD;
"God bless Sinai tell her 1 say so, Nerve."&#xD;
"Danno as I shall! 'fore my hebenly Jesus I&#xD;

Soon after this the old woman took her leave,&#xD;
and Winny rousing herself from deep thought,&#xD;
said,&#xD;
"Edgar! if it were possible for Sina to like&#xD;
my father well enough, I could wish him to marry&#xD;

She would bring his declining years great com-&#xD;

and white now f-were thrown up over her head&#xD;
upon the pillow, with that helpless abandon so&#xD;
piteous to see in the versj weak. Even the de-&#xD;
ceptive flush ~iad faded from her cheek, and the&#xD;
pale yellow locks escaped in her restlessness&#xD;
from the little lace cap, clung damp and clammy&#xD;
to the cheek and bosom, bathed with the ex-&#xD;
hausting "night sweat." Her breathing was&#xD;
distressing, short, quick, interrupted; or, if s&#xD;
long breath seas drawn, it was emitted like a&#xD;
shuddering sigh, while a spasm of pain would&#xD;
contract the wan face, and a slight convulsion&#xD;
agitate the fragile form. As he watched her&#xD;
sleep of deep prostration, and her painful and&#xD;
spasmodic breathing, Ardenne bitterly reproach-&#xD;
ed himself; but with that singular propensity of&#xD;
miad that draws us to analogies even in hours&#xD;
of extreme distress, he thought of the bird he&#xD;
had caught and crushed in his hand, through his&#xD;
eagerness to possess it; of the flower he had&#xD;
plucked which had withered on hi'. bo~om, and&#xD;
he looked upon this poor, fragile, fadii'i~ human&#xD;
flower, rudely torn from the parent strm. and&#xD;
dying on its bed; and he groaned-he rentedd&#xD;
so that had her sleep been other than the pro-&#xD;
found lethargy of prostrated weakness it must&#xD;
have awakened her.&#xD;
He arose, and opening a window at some die&#xD;
tance from the bed, to ~,et in the cool, clear&#xD;
morning air, he dressed himself and went down&#xD;
stairs, leaving her still asleep. He opened the&#xD;
shutters of their parlor-or kitchen, as ~ oa will,&#xD;
for it served for both-and began to make a&#xD;
fire. Leaving it blazing and crackling, he took&#xD;
a pail and went to the s~irsng, and, returning,&#xD;
filled the teadrettle, and set it over the fire.&#xD;
Ardenne knew more of domestic economy than&#xD;
Winny. The only child of a youthful and wi-&#xD;
dowed mother, he had received the education&#xD;
both of a girl and a boy. And, by the way, I&#xD;
have noticed that by far the most amiable, the&#xD;
most considerate, the most gentle and sympa-&#xD;
thetic men, where women are concerned, are&#xD;
those brought up from infancy to manhood by&#xD;
widowed mothers. I suppose the reason is&#xD;
plain enough-the early chastening of sorrow,&#xD;
-perhaps early acquaintance with privation,&#xD;
toil and disappointment, and, above all, early&#xD;
and intimate acquaintance with women's pecu-&#xD;
liar trials. The Angel of Sorrow does tiet pre.&#xD;

"Winny, my love, you should not have risen and holding it towards him, said,&#xD;

And saying this, and promising to return by&#xD;
noon. A.rdenne left the house&#xD;
Winny occupied the time of his absence witi&#xD;
looking through her new home, and finding oul&#xD;
where everything was placed.&#xD;
Woile waiting the result of his adverise~nent.&#xD;
Ardenne was not idle. lie would rise in the&#xD;
morning, and while Winny Was preparing theix&#xD;
simple breakfast, he would go out upon the&#xD;
mountain with his gun, and return with a brace&#xD;
of wild fowl. All the forenoon he would read&#xD;
law, seated at a table before the window&#xD;
of their sitting-room, while Winny sewed by&#xD;
his side In the afternoon he took an axe and&#xD;
went to the pine forest and cut woo to pile&#xD;
up for winter use. Later he would take his&#xD;
angling-rod and go down to the banks of the She-&#xD;
nandoah to fish, aad return with a fine lot. His&#xD;
hopes the first week were very high.&#xD;
"After all, dear Winny, if you were not the&#xD;
spoiled child of wealth and luxury, this hall&#xD;
savage life would not be amiss !"&#xD;
"Oh! J.'should like it of all things, if my dear-&#xD;
est grandmother were well, my father recon-&#xD;
oiled. and I could only get rid of this burning&#xD;
pang in my left chest!"&#xD;
Every mail day Ardenne would go down to&#xD;
Harper s Ferry, but in vain No "commrini-&#xD;
cation addressed to E. A SHarper's Ferry, Vir-&#xD;
ginia," was there to claim the promised "prompt&#xD;
attention." And at the end of the second week&#xD;
he began to grow very anxious. He kept at&#xD;
work, however, saying, cheerfully, to Winny-&#xD;
"There is always something to be done, my&#xD;
dear Winny, and I have observed through life&#xD;
that people waste more time in waiting the&#xD;
result of future contingencies than in any other&#xD;
manner."&#xD;
Ardenne had laid aside from his small store,&#xD;
a sum of money to pay the bills of the physician&#xD;
and the tavern-keeper. The third week passed&#xD;
and Ardenne received no answer to his advertise-&#xD;
ment. Then he withdrew it, substituting an-&#xD;
other wiehaut restriction as to place This was&#xD;
also unsuccessful. Next he advertised for a&#xD;
situation as clerk in a lawyer's office - private&#xD;
secretary to a gentleman. or bcok-keeper in a&#xD;
store in vain! Those who have no necessity&#xD;
for labor, or who find employment sufflient to&#xD;
supply their wants, have rio idea of the wearing&#xD;
anxiety of one seeking work from week to week&#xD;
and finding none--while expenses are going on,&#xD;
or a family is suffering. Ardenne was sick at&#xD;
heart-everything seemed at a stand 'till-the&#xD;
world to be stationary A graveyard sort of&#xD;
qe ness seemed to ecn ove a!i th- ene- 4&#xD;
least to him wac appeared to no useess and&#xD;
&#xD;
59&#xD;
&#xD;
e needless to society; still they continued to do&#xD;
"whatever" their hands founil "to do."&#xD;
~ "For at least, Winny, here is an opportunity&#xD;
of putting ~his place in complete order," snid&#xD;
Ardenne, and between the times of his reading&#xD;
law, he would work at making a wood-houor ad-&#xD;
joining the cottage and filling it with wood ready&#xD;
cut. Winny, on her part, with the assistance arid&#xD;
instruction of Hettie Smilie, the innkeeper's&#xD;
daughter, had made up her own plain dresses and&#xD;
put Ardenne's wardrobe, which was n great&#xD;
disarray, into complete order. Then Hettie said&#xD;
to her,&#xD;
"If I were you, Mrs. Ardenne-"&#xD;
"Call me Winny, Hettie."&#xD;
"1 always forget to-if I were you 1 would&#xD;
put up some preserves for winter use."&#xD;
"But they are expensive luxuries and we do&#xD;
not need them."&#xD;
"Yes! they as-a expensive luxuries if you put&#xD;
them up with double refined loaf sugar-pound&#xD;
for pound, like your grandmother used to-bur&#xD;
suppose you get toe coarse brown sugar, and&#xD;
clarify it yourself, and put up some plume and&#xD;
grapes-that will be cheap, and you will find&#xD;
that often in the winter, when you are not able&#xD;
to get a regular dinner, a cup of tea and bread&#xD;
and butter, with a saucer of preserves, will go&#xD;
very well. So, Mrs. Ardenne, we will go if you&#xD;
please into the forest to-morrow with two bas-&#xD;
kets and gather some wild grapes, and wild&#xD;
piums also, if any are yet to be found-and next&#xD;
day I will show you how to put them up, so as&#xD;
it will cost almost nothing but the work."&#xD;
Ard so accordingly they did.&#xD;
Fiettie remained a week with Winny, and&#xD;
then Willie Smilie, her cousin, came for her.&#xD;
Widie had something in a bag on one side of his&#xD;
~addle, which he brought in* and set upon the&#xD;
floor-and while Hettie was getting her bonnet,&#xD;
Willie, with many blushes, opened the bag and&#xD;
drew lorth-a stone jar for putting up preserves,&#xD;
and holding it up, he stammered.-~-&#xD;
I was along by Mr. What-his-name's store&#xD;
to-day, and saw this here, and I thought it was&#xD;
party, and so I bought it, like a great many things&#xD;
don't want, and so-and-so-"&#xD;
Oh, hush, Willie, your hypocrisies are as&#xD;
coarse and as easily seen through as a wicker&#xD;
chicken-coop! Mrs. Ardenne, he wants to make&#xD;
you a present of a blue stone jarand he does not&#xD;
know how to do it-dear Mrs. Ardenne, do take&#xD;
it from him, poor fellow, for with all his rude-r&#xD;
ness, he is so sensitive, that he will never get&#xD;
over it if you hurt his feelings by refusing," ad.&#xD;
ded Hettiein alow voice-unheardby hercousin,&#xD;
who blushing purple, had set the jar down in a&#xD;
trepidation.&#xD;
"is this for me ?" asked Winny, taking it up&#xD;
and looking at Willie.&#xD;
-, Yes, Miss-ma'am!" exploded Willie.&#xD;
"It is a nice jar indeed? arid will be veryese-&#xD;

"My father !-how is he 7"&#xD;
'*Dear child! grief don't kill whom anger&#xD;
keeps alive. The squire is well, only suffering&#xD;
from a Sinamania."&#xD;
"Nerve told me something of that."&#xD;
"Yes-it is just so- when love or fever seizes&#xD;
a fat old sinner, it is extremelyy apt to; go ex-&#xD;
tremely hard with him. I beg your pardon for&#xD;
speaking so, Winny, but the fact is, you know&#xD;
I rather likeo your father myself, so that I am&#xD;
a little mad, and a good deal jealous, at being&#xD;
overlooked for the sake of an unprincipled and&#xD;
meretricious girl like Miss Hirton !"&#xD;
"For Heaven's sake, Harriette! don't talk so&#xD;
of Sina!"&#xD;
"Ttiere it is again! I tell you that those are&#xD;
my settled convictions of Miss Sina Hinton, and&#xD;
you will arrive at the same concussions in the&#xD;
end I tell these things to Mrs. Summerfield,&#xD;
but she turns a deaf ear to me-the truth is.&#xD;
because I have overflowing spirits, and exu-&#xD;
bera~t life, and a jesting way of delivering my&#xD;
oracles, people despise them. I will try to&#xD;
gra~ serious, if it be only to be listened to."&#xD;
"And ~ttunt Summerfield and Imogene-why,&#xD;
then. do they not sed me a kind word, or&#xD;
line I-it would come to tue grateful as rain to&#xD;
the parched desert," said Winny. "Is it that&#xD;
roy gentle Aunt Summerfield and my Cousin&#xD;
lmogeiie, my sweet cousin, with her celestial&#xD;
serenity. cherish unkind feelings towards me?"&#xD;
"No, Winny-they do not-but Mrs. Sum-&#xD;
merfield feels, perhaps too keenly, the situa-&#xD;
tion of her mother-associates you too painfully&#xD;
with the subject. Then you know, with all her&#xD;
gentleness, Mrs Summerfield has very rigid&#xD;
ideas of filial duty. I believe that she feels for&#xD;
you a great deal, hut that she considers you as&#xD;
undergoing a penalty for error-a penalty with&#xD;
which she has no right to interfere, and which&#xD;
she has no right to alleviate! As for Imogene&#xD;
-l do not know what to make of that lady!&#xD;
She is so grave. I was over there yesterday,&#xD;
and as she swept through the room, she paused,&#xD;
and looking at me with her slowly lighting&#xD;
eyes-you know that peculiar expression-as if&#xD;
her soul were returning from a long journey,&#xD;
she said-&#xD;
'~'Do you ever see or hear of my cousin,&#xD;
Mrs. Ardenne?'&#xD;
"'No.' replied I.&#xD;
"'You have never visited her since her mar-&#xD;
riage?'&#xD;
"'Never.'&#xD;
Y.r von were friends.'&#xD;
"'Thick as pickpockets-only Winny nevel&#xD;
took me into her confidence in the affair of her&#xD;

CC~*hy have 'you not been to see her, then?'&#xD;

put it in our own, for I don't know a poorer&#xD;
purse than ours.'&#xD;
"'Then I presume if you could reach her, you&#xD;
would like to see Mrs. Ardenne?'&#xD;
"'Shouldn't I like to see Winny?'&#xD;
"'In that case, I will give orders that a pal-&#xD;
frey be taken over to Sacred Heart, to remain&#xD;
there for your use, as long as shall be agreeable&#xD;
-good-morning,' and with a quiet, imperial,&#xD;
half-abstracted air, she passed from the room;&#xD;
so that you see, Winny, I owe the pleasure of&#xD;
this visit to Miss Summerfield, at last."&#xD;
"flow I should love my cousin, if she would&#xD;
only let me I"&#xD;
"There is something so strange about Miss&#xD;
Summerfield-a beautiful solemnity of brow, as&#xD;
of one who walking in the light of a high reve~&#xD;
rence inspires the same feeling in others. But&#xD;
Winny, dear, I bring you a message from Miss&#xD;
Mattie Smilie; she says she thinks that the air&#xD;
of the valley will now be a beneficial change for&#xD;
you, and she wants you to come and stay a week&#xD;
with her."&#xD;
"That is so kind in her; they are the sweetest&#xD;
family, those dear Smilies; tell her that whether&#xD;
I come or not, 1 shall feel very grateful for her&#xD;

As Ardenne came in, and not seeing their visi-&#xD;

claimed, "Me, too, Edgar! you are on my kis-&#xD;
sing list now I"&#xD;
"And pray how long is the said list, Miss&#xD;
Harry, that one may know the extent of the&#xD;
compliment ?"&#xD;
"Don't speer questions, Mr. Edgar! Does the&#xD;
extent of the compliment depend upon the length&#xD;
of the list 7"&#xD;
"Don't speer questions, Miss Harry! No! but&#xD;
on the sk.orgness of it."&#xD;
"Then I beg you to feel highly flattered, for&#xD;
my kissing list boasts but one name-Winny&#xD;
Ardenne-that is all."&#xD;
"Then it shall be a variation of that pretty&#xD;
name, Miss Harry," smiled Ardenne, as his lips&#xD;
lighted swiftly upon her half-laug4ing, haif-peut..&#xD;
ing ones. ~c There, Harriette; now, when ever&#xD;
you place another name upon your list, erase&#xD;
mine, for then I will never kiss you again," said&#xD;
Edgar, very solemnly.&#xD;
"Good gracious! what a se~erb punishment!&#xD;
I'm glad you told me, because kissing is my be.-&#xD;

Harriette's face flushed with indignation, and&#xD;
she remained silent for awhile; then-&#xD;
"Have you, Miss' Summerfield, no power&#xD;

Imogene lifted her heavy lashes, but before&#xD;
her slow reply was formed, Mr.. Summerfield&#xD;
answered,&#xD;
"Miss Summerfield must not expose herself&#xD;
to her uncle's violence of temper, Harriette."&#xD;
"Very well, then," thought Harry; "thank&#xD;

and no false pride to be humbled, though it waa'&#xD;
be false courage that prompts me now to&#xD;
"'Beard the lion in his den,&#xD;
The Douglass in his hell;'&#xD;
and I will wait on Squire Darling myself."&#xD;
This was Harriette's secret resolution, but she&#xD;
did not express it. Something of a natural,&#xD;
though quiet kauteur in the manners both of the&#xD;
elder and the younger lady, ever chilled Har..&#xD;
riette into reserve. Soon she took her depar-&#xD;

wards Oak Grove.&#xD;

Li this the home? The owlet's dreary cry&#xD;
Unto that asking makes a sad reply.  ZVicoll.&#xD;
Nothing could be more dreary than the aspect&#xD;
of Oak Grove, as Harriette approached it. Every&#xD;
thing about the plantation bore testimony to the&#xD;
despairing neglect of its master. It was very&#xD;
evident that Squire Darling no longer rode at&#xD;
morn and eve all over his estate to see with his&#xD;
own eyes that every thing was done properIy~&#xD;
It was proved that he no longer heeded his favo-&#xD;
rite proverb, that, "The master's eye doth&#xD;
more work than the servants' hands." Fences&#xD;
were broken; gates down; fields littered; cattle&#xD;
straying; negroes dozing in the blazing autumn&#xD;
sun; every thing bore marks of indifference auid&#xD;
neglect. Harriette's spirits fell, oppressed by&#xD;
the scene.&#xD;
"At least, though, this shows that' be Iowa&#xD;

change was here! This fine, heavily-shaded&#xD;
lawn, which it used to be the easy task of a&#xD;
score of little negro children to keep perfectly&#xD;
clean and smooth, free alike from litter, weeds,&#xD;
or fallen leaves,-this lawn was now grown&#xD;
thickly up with thistles, drying in the autumn&#xD;
sun, tall Jamestown weeds, rank with ripe pol-&#xD;
eon, and filling all the air with their baleful eflIn-&#xD;
via, and drifts of dried leaves that rattled and&#xD;
rustled noisily under her horse's hoofs. As yet,&#xD;
she had seen not a single soul beyond the lazy&#xD;
group of negroes she had left in the field, dozing&#xD;
in the hot sun. As she wended her way up the&#xD;
grass-grown walk, a large snake started up be-&#xD;
fore her horse's hoofs, and glided swiftly away.&#xD;
A superstitious awe had been slowly gathering&#xD;
over Harriette's spirit, and now a shock of fear&#xD;
thrilled through her nerves. She looked up at&#xD;
The house. The front doors and windows were&#xD;
all closed. Cobwebs were stretched across those&#xD;
of Winny's deserted rooms; dried leaves had&#xD;
fallen and lodged in them, and the little insect&#xD;
called the mason, had built its house of' clay in&#xD;
the corners of the sills. Deserted, desolate,&#xD;
and forlorn! Harriette had not spirits to go up&#xD;
the mildewed stone steps, and ring the rusty&#xD;
bell. She turned her horse's head and trotted&#xD;
of! towards the Quarters to find Nerve-giving&#xD;
a fearful glance behind her, as though she dread-&#xD;
ed having been seen from the house. The dreary&#xD;
and forsaken aspect of the place made Harry's&#xD;
nerves tremble as though she were doing some&#xD;
wrong, fearing some discovery, and incurring&#xD;
some punishment. Harry trotted down the hill&#xD;
to the hollow where were situated the Quarters,&#xD;
ten little white cabins each side of the street,&#xD;
with a larger cabin facing down the line at the&#xD;
upper end. This place looked scarcely less lone-&#xD;
some than the house. Here in the doors sat&#xD;
negro women, dawdling over their patching, or&#xD;
old men smoking, or old grannies with the woolly&#xD;
heads of young negroes between their knees,&#xD;
engaged with finger and thumb in a nameless&#xD;
work of destruction. Each nodded, or spoke&#xD;
respectfully to Miss Harry as she passed them,&#xD;
and rode up to Uncle Kill's house. Here she&#xD;
jumped off her horse, and, passing the little gate,&#xD;
went in. The front door war open, and gave a&#xD;
view of Nerve within, seated among baskets of&#xD;
apples, and pans and dishes, engaged in cutting&#xD;
up fruit for drying.&#xD;
"Come in, Miss Harry, chile, come in! 'xcuse&#xD;
me for not getting' up, 'ca'se my lap's full o'&#xD;
pains. Sit down, Miss Hairy, honey, sit down!&#xD;
Row's the ole gen'l'man, Father Bully; God&#xD;
bless him! Take of your hat, Miss Harry,&#xD;
chile, an' lay it down on table. Has you seen&#xD;
anything o' my poor baby? We-dem heerd how&#xD;
she was staying long o' you I Is she dere yet?"&#xD;
"She has been staying with us a fortnight,&#xD;
but has now returned home-she is in very bad&#xD;
health, Nerve."&#xD;
&#xD;
)NDALE.&#xD;
ttPoor baby! poor, dear chile! I knowec. ti&#xD;
an' I aint been to see her since that first tbt~,&#xD;
cause you see, Miss Harry, when ole mar~~-.&#xD;
found out how I had been there, he like t -i&#xD;
split the shingles off o' top o' the house,&#xD;
seared how he'd sell the fuss nigger as tuk&#xD;
least notice o' her, far as ever hor~'e an' u&#xD;
could carry them! 'Fore my hebenly Mars&#xD;
he did, honey! An' he said how lie meani&#xD;
starve or freeze the ondutiful gall to her senses&#xD;
to death, one or the torher!"&#xD;
"I am going to speak to him about Winny,&#xD;
Nerve 1"&#xD;
"I 'vise you not to! You run your head right&#xD;
into a hornet's nest, if you so much as mention&#xD;
her name, let alone plead for her! You better&#xD;
let him alone !-he tuk leave o' ~li sense an' de-&#xD;
cency 1-he'll 'suit you quick as wink !-'fore&#xD;
my bebenly 'Deemer, will he! You can't do&#xD;
nothing' 'tall wid him! He don't do nothing' but&#xD;
sit in that there house from morning' till night,&#xD;
and drink an' swill, an' every singly thing about&#xD;
the place is going to rack and ruin! Poor ole&#xD;
man Kill do the best he can-he's overseer, you&#xD;
know-but br'! he can't do nothin' 'tall with&#xD;
the niggers, cause you see, when they 'glects&#xD;
their duty, he t'reatens how he'll 'port them to&#xD;
ole master, but you know, Miss Harry, if ole&#xD;
master don't pay, no tensionn to his 'porte-how&#xD;
they goin' to mm' his treats ?"&#xD;
"I am sorry to hear he drinks so!"&#xD;
CC He don't do nothing' 'tall else from' mornin'&#xD;
till night, chile!"&#xD;
"Well! anyhow, Nerve; I came here for the&#xD;
purpose of seeing him, and I intend to see and to&#xD;
speak to him in Winny's behalf, too!"&#xD;
"'Fore my hebenly Marster, he'll 'suIt you;&#xD;
he will indeed, honey!"&#xD;
"Which way shall I get in, Nerve? the front&#xD;
part of the house is all shut up."&#xD;
"Stop, honey I I'll go 'long o' you," said the&#xD;
old woman, pushing the apple parings out of her&#xD;
lap into an old basket, and preparing to accom-&#xD;
pany Harry.&#xD;
They left the house, Harry leaving her horse&#xD;
there, and walked towards the Hall. Nerve&#xD;
conducted her in through the back piazza, and&#xD;
stopped to ask her whether she would visit "ole&#xD;
madam" ~1rst, or go into the parlor. Harry de.&#xD;
cided to see the invalid, and the old woman led&#xD;
the way up stairs, and to the door of Mrs. Dar-&#xD;
ling's room. Then the sound of voices made&#xD;
Nerve pause, and hold up her finger to Harry. It&#xD;
was Sina's voice, in a high key and insolent tone,&#xD;
apparently speaking to the old lady.&#xD;
"And Nerve shall not come up these stairs&#xD;
with her impudent interference, and her awk-&#xD;
ward blunders, and her mischief~making. If you&#xD;
want anything done for you, I'll do it!"&#xD;
A low and plaintive reply was made to this&#xD;
rude speech, the only word distinguishable being&#xD;
"Winny."&#xD;
&#xD;
SHANNC&#xD;
"You know it is against the orders of Squire&#xD;
Darling to send any message, or hold any com-&#xD;
munication with that young woman, and I am&#xD;
here to see his orders enforced"&#xD;
"Come, Nerve! Come! my blood is boiling!&#xD;
my heart will burst! let me in! it is improper,&#xD;
an'~ how, to listen-and to such insolence as that!&#xD;
let me in, Nerve, and stop that indignity, or 1&#xD;
shall lose my reason, burst the door open, seize&#xD;
that impudent girl and shake the breath out of&#xD;
her body! Let rue in, Nerve; for 1 do not want&#xD;
to forget myself."&#xD;
Nerve, with an "1-told-you-so" look, opened&#xD;
the door and followed her into the room. The&#xD;
ol~ lady was sitting in her arm-chair, the very&#xD;
rure of imbecile suffering. Hariettte went to&#xD;
her and spoke very respectfully (purposely omit-&#xD;
ting to see Sina.)&#xD;
"Oh! how do you do, my dear? Did you&#xD;
know that Winny was gone ?" she inquired, with&#xD;
an appealing look of grief.&#xD;
"Yes, I know it-i saw Winny this morning 1"&#xD;
'-Did you! did you! Oh. how is Winny "'&#xD;
"She was over at our house she sent her love&#xD;
to you," replied Harry, evading the question of&#xD;
her health.&#xD;
"Over to your house! and did not come to see&#xD;
me!-does she know, does Winny know that I am&#xD;
h.elpless-r hat I have lost the use of my limbs ?"&#xD;
"Yes, Winny knows it, and grieves about it."&#xD;
"Tell her not to grieve! tell her not to grieve&#xD;
-tell Winny I do very well! she mustn't grieve!&#xD;
she mustn't grieve I you mustn't tell her any-&#xD;
thing to make her grieve. I'm sorry now she&#xD;
lnows I am helpless; but why don't Winny come&#xD;
to see me, then ?"&#xD;
"She wants to come, but they won't let her."&#xD;
~CWho won't? who won't? It's my house-&#xD;
my jointure house! and no one has a right to&#xD;
prevent her !-she shall come! tell her so! tell&#xD;
her to come! i'll see !" said the old lady, the&#xD;
spirit of her youth flashing fitfully up.&#xD;
"Really, Miss Harriette Joy! I shall be forced&#xD;
to request you to leave the room, if yoh excite&#xD;
Mrs. Darling in this manner!" said Miss Hin~&#xD;
ton, coming forward.&#xD;
Harry sprang sharply around, confronting the&#xD;
girl, and flashed upon her a look of such blight-&#xD;
ing scorn and indignation, that the audacity of&#xD;
tbe wily girl nearly wilted under it, and she&#xD;
continued more quietly-&#xD;
"Mrs, Darling cannot bear the least excite-&#xD;
ment, and the name of Winny-"&#xD;
"Mrs Ardenne, I presume you mean," said&#xD;
Harry, haughtily.&#xD;
"Mrs. Ardenne, then," continued Sina, with&#xD;
an imperceptible smile, "is a forbidden name&#xD;
in this house!"&#xD;
Harry fixed her dark eyes, blazing with insuf-&#xD;
ferable light, upon those of Sina Ilinton, 'ud&#xD;
tending her arm, pointed to the 'oor, saying,&#xD;
"Sins kiinton, leave the room! I overheard&#xD;

Sina Hinton recovered er momentary quail.&#xD;
ing, and smiling, toucied the bell Harry re-&#xD;
garded her with as much surp. '- as indignation,&#xD;
and something even oi' admiration. She had&#xD;
changed very much within the last t~w in'neiitw.&#xD;
There was a sort of attraction, glamour, witch-&#xD;
craft, or what not, about that thin, pierce face,&#xD;
that being neither beauty noi- goodness, was&#xD;
more fascinating thai either -it was unity,&#xD;
power, strength, a diabolical individuality - The&#xD;
bell was answered by a servant, to whom she&#xD;
said,&#xD;
"Tell your master that I crave his presence&#xD;
for a few moments in this room."&#xD;
She spoke with an air of assured authority,&#xD;
and the man, bowing with great respect, with-&#xD;
drew to obey her.&#xD;
"Leave the room, Minerva," was her next&#xD;
order.&#xD;
And old Nerve, saying to Harriette as she&#xD;
passed-" Let us go, Miss Harry. for Sam is&#xD;
going to be riz here directly!" went oui.&#xD;
The step ol Squire Darling was heard upon&#xD;
the stairs, and $ina turned er dark, bright&#xD;
face, with its stiletto lignt gleaming out ii"-&#xD;
tween the wilderness of black, shining ringlets,&#xD;
with a fierce smile upon Harriette..&#xD;
The squire entered the' room, saving, with a&#xD;
maudlin fondness-&#xD;
"What does my lightning-bug-what does&#xD;
my little fire-fly-what does my sprite want&#xD;
with me, now ?"&#xD;
His face was flushed, his eyes blood-shot, his&#xD;
step unsteady, and he sunk heavily inro a chair.&#xD;
Harriette saw, and groaned in the spirit&#xD;
"Well, what does my little mustard-seed&#xD;
want with me, now ?"&#xD;
"Send that girl from the house !"&#xD;
"That girl !-whieh girl ?" asked the poor&#xD;
man, his inflamed eyes flying around the room,&#xD;
and settling on Harriette. "Oh! that's Miss&#xD;
Harry !-that's little Nimrod !-musn't send ker&#xD;
away I"&#xD;
"Then, Squire Darling, I must go," said&#xD;
Miss Hinton, a flush rising to he~ brow.&#xD;
"You! you go! oh, never-stop! I'll send&#xD;
her oft! i'll do anything you tell me to do,&#xD;
Sins 1-tell me to march up before the whole&#xD;
congregation-up the altar-steps and pull Father&#xD;

roorn M~rs. Summerfield left her seat to accom-&#xD;
pany her daughter, but with a death-like brow,&#xD;
and frantic. adjuring gesture, Imogene repul-&#xD;
sed her&#xD;
'Merciful Hea 'en! what is tArs? What but&#xD;
GUILT should bidv it..e!f ttus from even a mo-&#xD;
ther eyes? Whet sorrow hut aznoasz should&#xD;

was so hapoy! 50 fill! of life and light before&#xD;
she left home P none so gay as she! Now what&#xD;
a changel Merciful Heaven! what ,J~'es it&#xD;

tics. of her melancholy disturbs her! Any ques.&#xD;
tion as to its cause agitats her nearly to death;&#xD;
I must not allude to it again I May the Virgin&#xD;
protect her!"&#xD;
Such was the mental soliloquy of Mrs. Sum-&#xD;
merfield, as she resumed her seat and mechani-&#xD;
callysirent on with heu tambouring&#xD;
the dinner hour drew on, Imogene re-&#xD;
appeared, but with a majestic gravity settled&#xD;
Ii       upon her brow, that repelled every, even her&#xD;
It       mother's inquiries and comments. When they&#xD;
it       had left the tahie, and were seated again by the&#xD;
fire, Miss Suromerfielil inquired,&#xD;
"Wil you, my dear mother, send for Ardenne&#xD;
and Winny?"&#xD;
" Will it make you happy if I do, my darling&#xD;
child 7"&#xD;
~;~f:?~i~took her mother's hand and pressed&#xD;
"Mother, I desire it above all things."&#xD;
aI will send for them, then, to-morrow I"&#xD;
dearest mother! dismiss anxiety on my&#xD;
account-believe that there is nothing worse 1&#xD;
heart-sickness, as unreasonable as it is un-&#xD;
must he disease-for life seems to me&#xD;
valueless I-st 'times 1 lose all faith&#xD;
love for earth! and only pray for&#xD;
unconsciousness !-not death-for I do not live&#xD;
now !"&#xD;
"Imogene! you are the envy of the whole&#xD;
valley,-young, beautiful, accomplished,-an&#xD;
heiress, and betrothed to the most distinguished&#xD;
young man in the State, and yet-"&#xD;
"I am heart-sick and brain-sick, mother!"&#xD;
then, with a sudden relapse into her old reserve,&#xD;
It      she said-" I did ant meau to trouble you, mo-&#xD;
ther, with my nervousness-I otily meant to re- ~&#xD;
lieve your anxiety !"                       d&#xD;
"And you have not done so, lmogene I You C&#xD;
are ssot nervous! some dark secret shadows all&#xD;
your~,, mind I-some heavy grief weighs down&#xD;
your head. Imogene-"&#xD;
&#xD;
ND ALE.&#xD;
The lady had quickly forgotten her resolution&#xD;
of silence upon the subject of her daughter's&#xD;
melancholy, but was recalled to it by the in-&#xD;
creasing agitation of Miss Summerfield. She&#xD;
suddenly dropped the subject, and recurring to&#xD;
another, said-&#xD;
"I have given orders for the yellow chamber,&#xD;
with the adjoining dressing-room, to be prepared&#xD;
for Winny~"&#xD;
"Thank you, dearest mother! You confer&#xD;
a benefit on me, also, In giving me some one to&#xD;
care for, and be kind to-I mean some one who&#xD;
like the poor invalid, my Cousin Winny, really&#xD;
needs, really suffers for attention."&#xD;
The conversation dropped.&#xD;
Mrs Summerfield took up her knitting, and&#xD;
lmo~ene fell into her usual state of cold and dark&#xD;
abstraction. From this she was aroused by the&#xD;
opening of the door, and the announcement of&#xD;
Colonel Dangerfield, who immediately after en-&#xD;
tered the room.             -~&#xD;
CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
COLONEL DANGERFIELD.&#xD;
He lakes the hand I give not-nor withhold-&#xD;
Its pulse nor check'd-nor quickea'd-calmly cold,&#xD;
And still he goes unmourned-returns unsought-&#xD;
And ott when present-absent from my inought,&#xD;
Oh! hard it is the heart's recoil to bear,&#xD;
And hide from one-perhaps another there&#xD;
Byron.&#xD;
Colonel Dangerfield entered the parlor, bowing&#xD;
with his usual grave and stately courtesy. Mrs.&#xD;
Suinmerfield arose, curtsied, and indicated a seat.&#xD;
[mogene nodded gravely without rising. Colonel&#xD;
Dangerfield took the chair on the other side of&#xD;
the fire-place to that where Imogene was seated,&#xD;
md immediately entered into conversation with&#xD;
Ntrs. Summerfield, who was seated between&#xD;
~hem. Colonel Dangerfield was not a gentleman&#xD;
ivho considered his duty violated, if he failed on&#xD;
~oming in to take a seat by his lady-love; nor&#xD;
~as Mrs. Summerfield a lady who thought po.&#xD;
witness infringed, by remaining in the room dii-&#xD;
ing the visit of her daughter's accepted lover.&#xD;
Indeed, all this party seemed to shrink from&#xD;
anything very pronounce Nor was it until Mrs.&#xD;
ummerfield was summoned from the room by&#xD;
ter housekeeper, that Colonel Dangerfield, taking&#xD;
inogene's hand, led her to a distant sofa, seated&#xD;
mer, and stood before her with folded arms and&#xD;
evere brow. There was nothing lover-like in&#xD;
~is aspect. Imogene's hands lay folded one&#xD;
ver the other upon her lap, and her eyes cast&#xD;
own, seemed fixed upon them. He stood there&#xD;
contemplating her full a minute, and then said,&#xD;
"Imogene Summerfield I what is the relation&#xD;
supposed to be subsisting between us at this mo-&#xD;
sent?"&#xD;
&#xD;
SHANNO&#xD;
She was silent; a sigh or sob fluttered, strug-&#xD;
gled in her bosom, but did not escape.&#xD;
"Did you hear my question, Miss Summer-&#xD;
field?"&#xD;
"I heard it."&#xD;
"Will it please you to reply 7"&#xD;
"I am your betrothed wife-you do not per-&#xD;
mit me to forget it !" replied she, without raising&#xD;
her eyes&#xD;
"In what light do you consider this engage-&#xD;
ment, Inogene? Will you be so good as to look&#xD;
at m'~, Miss Summerfield, when replying to my&#xD;
question ?"&#xD;
Imogene's brow flushed as she raised her eyes,&#xD;
with their slow, returning light, slowly to his&#xD;
face, and fluted them there so steadily, that his&#xD;
falcon glance fell before their calm, perusing&#xD;
gaze.&#xD;
"I inquired, Miss Summerfield, in what light&#xD;
you were pleased to look on our betrothal 7"&#xD;
"I hold it to be sacred, inviolable! at least it&#xD;
shall be so on my side !" answered Imogene, in&#xD;
a tone so grave and firm, with a sigh, involun-&#xD;
tary, but so profound, that Colonel Dangerfield&#xD;
frowning darkly, said,&#xD;
"You say that, Miss Summerfield, with the&#xD;
air of a martyr. I pray you, were your inclina-&#xD;
tions influenced in the least in this matter 7"&#xD;
"They were influenced, Dangerfield! We were&#xD;
betrothed, you know, when I was an infant of&#xD;
five years of age, and you a youth of fifteen! I&#xD;
was early taught, along with the Cathechism of&#xD;
the Council of Nice, the Lord's Prayer, the&#xD;
Apostle's Creed, and the Ten Comtnandrnents, a&#xD;
love and veneration for you, as one older, wiser,&#xD;
more enlightened and more accomplished than&#xD;
myself, and above all, as one who was destined&#xD;
to be my husband. I had no brother or sister,&#xD;
and except Winny, who lived at a distance from&#xD;
me, no cousin! and I thought only of you."&#xD;
"Yet I was absent at the university!"&#xD;
"Bat pro gent. with my thoughts always."&#xD;
"Well! and then!"&#xD;
Ct And then came the seven years of the revo-&#xD;
lution! and I, child as I was, had my whole&#xD;
soul fired with love of country and of liberty--&#xD;
yes! and admiration of the boy-hero who, at&#xD;
sixteen years of age, threw down his books and&#xD;
seized his musket, and who, at twenty-four, re-&#xD;
turned, illustrious with military glory, and with&#xD;
the rank he bears now !" replied Imogene, with&#xD;
something of enthusiasm kindling her pale cheek.&#xD;
"And then," said Colonel Dangerfield, bit-&#xD;
terly, "when that boy-who in his first battle,&#xD;
and in every subsequent field-in all the trisis,&#xD;
privations, and dangers of his campaigns - in&#xD;
hunger and in cold-in vigil and in illness-in&#xD;
&#xD;
NDALE.                                  71&#xD;
battle and in tent-thought only of ON. being-&#xD;
one small girl-a calm, proud, majestic little&#xD;
princess of nature whose high heart he thought&#xD;
wou'd demand illustrious love! when that boy&#xD;
returned to lay h a laurels-few or many-at&#xD;
the feet of the maiden-how did she receive him?&#xD;
You are silent, Imogene I shall I answer ? - She&#xD;
met him wih a kindling blush of pride and love&#xD;
on cheek and brow; and when, in his own proper&#xD;
name and person, he offered to renew his be-&#xD;
trothal-ho w did she receive his vows ?"&#xD;
"With pride and joy! With ptide and joy,&#xD;
Dangerfield! to be a hero's chosen wife; but&#xD;
with the losrn of a sister, Dangerfield! Alas!&#xD;
alas! I knew no difference !"&#xD;
"What wild words are these, Miss Summer.&#xD;
field? You knew no difference! Do you knee.&#xD;
a difference ?" inquired Colonel Dangerfield in&#xD;
a severe tone.&#xD;
Imogene had dropped her face within her open&#xD;
palms, and remained silent.&#xD;
"Those few bright, glorious days! too bright,&#xD;
too glorious to last! Oh! we might hive known&#xD;
them for a phantasmagoria! an illusion! a bright&#xD;
vision vanished! We parted, Imogene-you to&#xD;
pass three years at school, for you were but fif-&#xD;
teen; I to my estate, left desolate during the&#xD;
war, to occupy the time of yout absence with&#xD;
converting that estate into a paradise for your&#xD;
reception. The three years are passed. The&#xD;
full time for the consummation of our marriage&#xD;
is at hand. You return from school-I claim your&#xD;
promise; and now you entreat a delay; I accede.&#xD;
But if I touch your hand it turns cold in mine!&#xD;
Once I pressed a kiss upon your bro'r that struck&#xD;
a sudden paleness down your cheeks! You&#xD;
reeled-I thought you would have fallen! How&#xD;
is this, Miss Summerfield 7"&#xD;
Imogene arose, trembling, and would have&#xD;
left her seat, but he intercepted her. "Alas,&#xD;
Dangerfield! my hand is yours whene~ er you&#xD;
claim it. But, oh! listen! before you take it,&#xD;
you must hear a dark secret! a sin that 1 have&#xD;
not dared to breathe in the confessional! a sor-&#xD;
row that I have not dared to confide to my mo-&#xD;
ther! and whe~n you have heard this secret you&#xD;
will cast away this hand with scorn! But not&#xD;
yet! I cannot enter upon it yet! Let me pass,&#xD;
sir! lam ill! fainting! let me pass to my room!&#xD;
Dangerfield! I will leave our destiny in your&#xD;
hands I you shall be the arbiter of mine! I can&#xD;
do no less, nor more! Goodbye I' and gliding&#xD;
past him she left the room, leaving him stupified&#xD;
with astonishment and horror. Recovering&#xD;
himself at last, he took his hat, and leaving an&#xD;
apology with a servant for Mrs. Suminerlield,&#xD;
left the house.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXII.&#xD;
THE DAY OF REST.&#xD;
How still the morning of the hallowed day!&#xD;
The poor man's day!&#xD;
The pale mechanic mow has leave to breathe&#xD;
The morning air pure from the city's smoke,&#xD;
As wandering slowly up the river's banks,&#xD;
He meditates on Him whose power he marks&#xD;
In each green tree that proudly sprends the bough&#xD;
And in the tiny dew-bent flowers that bloom&#xD;
Around the roots; and while he thus surveys&#xD;
With elevated joy each rural charm,&#xD;
He hopes-yet fears presumption in the hope,&#xD;
That Heaven may be one Sabbath without end!&#xD;
Gralsarne.&#xD;
Yes, it is only those who toil six days in the&#xD;
week, that feel all the love and mercy shown in&#xD;
the institution of the Sabbath-in the command&#xD;
that makes cessation of toil a dials-rest a re-&#xD;
ligious service. Winny's household-work was&#xD;
light enough, yet to ~tser delicate frame and sink-&#xD;
lug health and unaccustomed muscles, it was&#xD;
toil. She had learned from Hettie all that was&#xD;
necessary to know in the conducting of her small&#xD;
message-and now assumed the whole charge of&#xD;
the cooking, washing, house-cleaning and needle-&#xD;
work, upon herself; and with her fragility and&#xD;
inexperience, it took her all day to get through;&#xD;
and often in the day her frail limbs would fail,&#xD;
her head would swim, and her sight cloud from&#xD;
weakness; but never for weariness-never for&#xD;
pain would Winny pause while anything remain-&#xD;
ed to be done; and when night came, she would&#xD;
lie down thoroughly exhausted, yet oftentimes&#xD;
too much fatigued and excited to compose her-&#xD;
self to sleep, while the very idea of the inevi-&#xD;
table duty of rising again early in the morning&#xD;
to renew the incessant and now painful daily la-&#xD;
bor would appal her weak nerves, and keep her&#xD;
awake. Then that constantly recurring, cruel&#xD;
cough I the first dropping of her weary head upon&#xD;
the pillow seemed to be the signal for its com-&#xD;
mencement. it would continue all night. At&#xD;
dawn, as usual, she would fall into that heavy&#xD;
sleep and profuse bath of perspiration, i*hile it&#xD;
seemed that a rapid and exhausting process of&#xD;
absorption was going on, and from which she&#xD;
would awake so prostrated that it seemed impos-&#xD;
sible to get up, and the painful eflo t required all&#xD;
her little strength and courage. Opiates might&#xD;
haVe procured her rest, but Ardenne with his&#xD;
ideas about drugs, objected to their use, assert-&#xD;
mg that their beneficial tendency was transient,&#xD;
while their injurious effect was abiding. Then&#xD;
Ardenne believed that a favorable crisis was ap-&#xD;
proaching, which, if well watched and improved,&#xD;
would eventuate in the perfect re-e4abhshment&#xD;
of her health. This was th hope he held out to&#xD;
Winny all the time. And Winny knew also,&#xD;
that the time would come when another claim-&#xD;
&#xD;
ONDALE.&#xD;
ant would need all her remaining time and care&#xD;
and service. it was now therefore with a wish&#xD;
to improve her time of comparative leisure, that&#xD;
Winny toiled hard to set her house in order. She&#xD;
never complained. Ardenne's lot was hard&#xD;
enough, she said, and he inevitably saw enough&#xD;
without her complaints.&#xD;
Dut when the blessed Sabbath day dawned,&#xD;
the day that made repose not only a privilege&#xD;
that might not be improved, but a duty that&#xD;
must be observed, Winny hailed it with grati-&#xD;
tude. There was no cooking done that day except&#xD;
that the kettle was boiled, it is true that she&#xD;
might not be able always to leave the house, but I&#xD;
in that case she passed the day reclining her&#xD;
wearied frame upon a little lounge drawn up to&#xD;
the window, if the~autumn day was warm and&#xD;
* bright, to the fire if it were otherwise. And&#xD;
Ardenne wonid sit by her side and read, and&#xD;
* they would converse. They bad, upon some mat-&#xD;
ters, imbibed opposite opinions, or prejudice.,&#xD;
and when their opposing prejudices struck, a&#xD;
spark of truth, as from the meeting of flint and&#xD;
steel, would be elicited that would sometimes&#xD;
throw a ray of light into both souls never more&#xD;
to be extinguished. Bot~t said tbat in this mu-&#xD;
tual and frank confiding of all-even the most&#xD;
hidden and outrs~ thoughts, feelings, and expe-&#xD;
riences-they learned more than from all the&#xD;
books they had read. Thus it ever is between&#xD;
earnest and loving souls who do not fear to con-&#xD;
fide to each other their most secret thoughts,&#xD;
opinions, and speculations.&#xD;
Their home lay in the midst of a glorious&#xD;
scene, more glorious now iii this resplendent&#xD;
autumn weather. Notwithstanding all their&#xD;
privations-beauty and glory-ex'panded thought&#xD;
-high aspirations must be their portion here.&#xD;
It was on the day, the Sabbath day, after their&#xD;
return to their mountain home, that Winny ex-&#xD;
hausted, not indeed by work this time, but by the&#xD;
fatigue of her long ride of the evening previous,&#xD;
lay on her lounge-the little lounge made by&#xD;
Edgar, stuffed by Hettie, and covered with light&#xD;
blue calico by Winny. It was now drawn up to&#xD;
the open window, and Winny lay there half re-&#xD;
clining upon a pile of pillows, her long fair&#xD;
curls flowing over them-a coarse plaid shawl&#xD;
thrown over her, half concealing the plain whit.&#xD;
wrapper she wore. Ardenne was reading by&#xD;
her side, but his eyes continually wandered from&#xD;
his book to her sweet wan face, with its pure&#xD;
white forehead and hollow temples, its serenely&#xD;
arched eyebrows and drooping eyelids-&#xD;
"O'er which the violet vein&#xD;
Wandering leaves a tender stain."&#xD;
The sweet, wan spiritual face, with its trans-&#xD;
parent fairness and azure shadows I and its look&#xD;
of unconscious but angelic patience I If her eyes&#xD;
were ever lifted they ever smiled in his.&#xD;
It was a glorious autumn Sabbath, and a still&#xD;
&#xD;
SHAN~4 C&#xD;
and solemn brightness flooded with a golden&#xD;
light the gorgeous woods and sky, and both re-&#xD;
ceiving the influence of the time and place-&#xD;
bathed with a spirit of celestial love and beauty,&#xD;
notwithstanding all the wrong, remorse, and&#xD;
woe,--both were happy, for both felt deep as&#xD;
inspiration could dart its rays a still, calm con-&#xD;
fidence in omnipotent love and ilnal good! So&#xD;
reading and communing, loving and worshipping,;&#xD;
they passed the Heavenly day until the hour of&#xD;
noon, when they took their simple meal of tea,&#xD;
bread and butter, and preserves-and then as&#xD;
Winny waa refreshed they strolled out into the&#xD;
glowing forest with its rich and gorgeous foliage&#xD;
of crimson and gold, purple and green, burning in&#xD;
the rays of the afternoon sun. They returned&#xD;
from their walk-merely pausing before re~en-&#xD;
tering the cottage door to worship the Divinity&#xD;
in the setting sun, sinking like a world in a blaze,&#xD;
and lighting up the whole earth and sky with the&#xD;
insufferable glory of a general conflagration!&#xD;
While standing there they observed two eques-&#xD;
trians winding up the mountain path, now hid-&#xD;
den by a turn around some projecting rock, now&#xD;
lost in a clump of stunted cedars, now emerging&#xD;
and appearing in the full light-Miss Summer-&#xD;
fteld attended by a groom! Miss Summerfield&#xD;
looked well on horseback-she was not a dash-&#xD;
ing rider like Harrietre Joy, nor a swilt serial&#xD;
flyer like Winny had been, but her attitude was&#xD;
erect and easy-her motion slow and majestic.&#xD;
She wore a very dark grees habit and a beaver&#xD;
from which a fall of black ostrich feather min-&#xD;
gled with her raven ringlets. Surprised and&#xD;
deeply pleased to see her cousin, Winny passed&#xD;
her arm intq that of Ardenne and went forth to&#xD;
meet her. Imogene leaned down from her sad-&#xD;
dle and embraced her cousin, who said, with a&#xD;
faltering voice and deep feeling,&#xD;
"Oh, imogene I it is so good in you to come I&#xD;
I am so glad to see you !"&#xD;
In proof of which gladness Winny "burst&#xD;
out a crying." Ardenne bowed, but Imogene&#xD;
releasing Winny, held out her hand with a friend-&#xD;
ly look, and tlssn Ardenne shook it cordially,&#xD;
welcoming her to "Pine Cliffs" He led her&#xD;
horse to the block and helped her oft, and taking&#xD;
her arm in his conducted her into the house.&#xD;
"I had no idea of the length of this ride, my&#xD;
dear Winny," said Miss Summerfield, as she fol-&#xD;
lowed her cousin into the adjoining chamber.&#xD;
"No-it is deceiving-the distance from Red-&#xD;
Stone to Pine Cliffs is said to be ten miles, but&#xD;
by the winding of the bridle path in the ascent&#xD;
it makes it double that distance. You cannot&#xD;
return to night. I hope you will not mind the&#xD;
inconvenience of staying with us one night. We&#xD;
will make you comfortable as circumstances will&#xD;
admit," said Winny, while asitisting her cousin&#xD;
off with her habit. Imogene looked at her wan,&#xD;
blue, fair face, and fragile, evanescent form-and&#xD;
In reply pressed her affectionately to her bosom.&#xD;
7&#xD;
&#xD;
INDALE.                                 13&#xD;
." It will be agreeable to me, dear child I&#xD;
only fear the inconvenience to yourself, Wuinyl&#xD;
do you think I kept aloof from you with apurpo.e&#xD;
all this time ?"&#xD;
"Yes, Imogene, I thought so I-but 1 did not&#xD;
presume to judge your actions, far less to blame&#xD;
you! I felt that you were right in testifying&#xD;
your disapproval of my step."&#xD;
"My dear Winny, it was not that-' the heart&#xD;
knoweth its own bitterness l'-perhaps I was&#xD;
pre-occupied with myself."&#xD;
it was now Winny's turn to read in that high,&#xD;
regal brow, characters of profound suffering and&#xD;
stern endurance. It was like a mournful wail of&#xD;
solemn music without the words. Apparent,&#xD;
but not comprehensible; speaking to the emo-&#xD;
tions, but not to the understanding. There was&#xD;
something, too, that awed investigation, and&#xD;
Winny's eyes fell. Then-&#xD;
"How is my dear grandmother 7" she asked,&#xD;
in a low, tremulous voice.&#xD;
Imogene replied by telling her as much and&#xD;
as far as she knew, or was led to believe;&#xD;
among other things, that Miss Sina Hinton was&#xD;
very good to her, very kind and attentive, night&#xD;
and day, though the unfortunate lady, like many&#xD;
in her sad state, took a prejudice against her&#xD;
best friend, and disliked Miss Hinton. That&#xD;
they could never sufficiently repay Miss Hinton&#xD;
for staying there under all these unpleasant and&#xD;
adverse circumstances.&#xD;
Winny sunk down in a chair, dropped her heed&#xD;
upon the foot of the bed, and gave herself up&#xD;
to the agony of remorse and sorrows that the&#xD;
name of her grandmother, and the idea of her&#xD;
sufferings, always excited.&#xD;
A glance through the window, showed Mi.&#xD;
Summerfield that Ardenne was out in the yard,&#xD;
just going off to show the groom where to put&#xD;
the horses, and she turned and addressed her-&#xD;
self to comforting Winny.&#xD;
"Dear child, you confirm what Harriette&#xD;
told me. Your remorse is morbid-it is a dis-&#xD;
ease, and it is killing you! Winny, your very&#xD;
error drew upon you duties-not of regret, re.&#xD;
morse, but of a kind that regret and resnorse&#xD;
are utterly opposed to, and inconsistent with!&#xD;
Do you think that your immoderate remorse&#xD;
for your marriage will promote Edgar's happi-&#xD;
ness 7"&#xD;
"Oh, no! and I do not regret our marriage!&#xD;
No! come what will, in this world or the next,&#xD;
1 shall never regret our marriage! lt is my&#xD;
disobedience I repent; its consequences to others&#xD;
I lament I"&#xD;
"Well, for that disobedience you have just..&#xD;
ly, though severely, suff~red,-and deeply re-&#xD;
pented. Yet justice has been tempered with&#xD;
mercy-some of its consequencess' have been&#xD;
as profoundly ha~pv as others have been disas-&#xD;
trous. Your very sufferings have severely test-&#xD;
ed the love of your husband, and you i~ave&#xD;

I&#xD;
&#xD;
fou.ti it inexhaustible. In that love you have&#xD;
been profoundly iiappy.---highly blessed 1-that&#xD;
love at length is right, now-is religious, now&#xD;
-evil may surround it, but cannot touch it,&#xD;
cannot mingle with it! Oh 1 I have thought&#xD;
of tle fall of wan 1-the loss of Eden I-the&#xD;
goinc forth into the wilderness! And I have&#xD;
felt that the curse was not so great 1-the loss&#xD;
so heavy 1-the exile so dreary, after all 1 It&#xD;
was just the 'curse' that a Merciful God, a&#xD;
Loving Father, to keep His word, would have&#xD;
inficted-to save His children,, would have&#xD;
softened-for they were sent forth together, with.&#xD;
leave to love! How much more terrible would&#xD;
have been the curse to either, had either re-&#xD;
tained PARADIsE-alone !-had they been for-&#xD;
bidden to love!"&#xD;
Winny's eyes were fixed with intense inte-&#xD;
rest upon the solemnly eloquent countenance&#xD;
of Miss Summerfield, and she almost uncon-&#xD;
sciousi v exclaimed-&#xD;
"Imogene 1 you love 1"&#xD;
"Hush.! hush.' I am betrothed, I ought to&#xD;
love 1" replied she, hastily and huskily, growing&#xD;
so very white under the gentle, but penetrating&#xD;
scrutiny of her cousin, that Winny quickly&#xD;
withdrew her glance. Recovering herself, Miss&#xD;
Summerfield said-.-" I wish you to rouse, Win.&#xD;
ny I-the past is irreparable! Fidelity to pre-&#xD;
aent duties is possible and pressing Get cheer-&#xD;
ful and well 1-look at things broadly and in-&#xD;
telligently- -Heaven is always repairing the er-&#xD;

work some have to suffer by the faults, and for&#xD;
the good of others-it is the beloved of God who&#xD;
are chosen for this service. God gave His only&#xD;
Son for the redemption of the world How&#xD;
trite that text, but how full of meaning-how&#xD;
broad-how suggestive. It is the best beloved&#xD;
children of Heaven who suffer here for the&#xD;
good of the others. If we judge by her divine&#xD;
spirit of love and goodness, our venerable pa-&#xD;
rent is one of those beloved ones-she suffers&#xD;
by, and through, and for others! You, Winny,&#xD;
needed this very schooling that you are getting&#xD;
-will you only improve it? My Uncle Dar-&#xD;
ling,-with all respect be it spoken-I fear,&#xD;
needs some severe discipline also. He may not&#xD;
benefit by it. We too often delay all the kind&#xD;
purposes of Heaven towards us-delay-not de-&#xD;
feat, for I fully believe in the final triumph of&#xD;
Heaven, and of good! But Winny, my dear&#xD;
child, I did not come to preach you an after-&#xD;
noon sermon, but to make you a proposi-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
C' Well, come in to the parlor fire, it is bla-&#xD;
zing cheerfully now, and then we can talk,"&#xD;
replied Winny, leading the way into the next&#xD;
room, eetti.'g a c~~air for Imogene by the fire,&#xD;
and seating i~sisslt b~ her side.&#xD;
CC Where is Edgar?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Gone to the spring, to get water to fill the&#xD;
tea-kettle," replied Winny, a slight blush of&#xD;
shame (for which she mentally reproached her.&#xD;
self,) stinging her pale cheek.&#xD;
"My proposition, Winny 1 My mother and&#xD;
myself are lonely at Red- Stone, even now, in&#xD;
this fine weather, when there is so much visit-&#xD;
ing. But soon the winter will be upon us,&#xD;
and the river will be frozen over, enclosing us&#xD;
on three sides, and we shall be very lonely-&#xD;
soon, also, this bleak cliff of yours will be unin-&#xD;
habitable, from its exposed situation, and the&#xD;
severe cold. So I come, in the name of my mo-&#xD;
ther, as well as myself, to beg that you and&#xD;
Edgar will shut up your house for the winter,&#xD;
and come and visit us until spring Do, Win-&#xD;
ny 1 we should make a snug, happy family there,&#xD;
all of us together. We should be quite inde-&#xD;
pendent of our neighbors for soz~iety I"&#xD;
Winny took her cousin's hinud and pressed it&#xD;
gratefully; then she said, with much feeling ex-&#xD;
pressed in her tone,&#xD;
"I thank you, Imogene-I am profoundly sen-&#xD;
sible of your kind and affectionate purpose. Oh,&#xD;
yes, 1 thank you earnestly for your generous pro-&#xD;
position, and for the delicate manner of ma-&#xD;
king it."&#xD;
"And you will accept it, my dear cousin ?"&#xD;
C~No&#xD;
"No ?-why not? I cannot think you are&#xD;
in earnest"&#xD;
Winny's cheek slightly flushed; she replied,&#xD;
"We have nothing left but our self-respect-&#xD;
let us retain that 1"&#xD;
"Your self-respect, Winny I What do y~&#xD;
mean? Your self-respect compromised by pay-&#xD;
ing us a visit? That is very complimentary to&#xD;
us, my dear Whiny I"&#xD;
"Imogene, people do not pay visits of only&#xD;
ten miles distant, six months long 1 1 tnank you,&#xD;
dear Imogenel If any one could mase indebted-&#xD;
ness look like independence-and a benefit re-&#xD;
ceived appear an obligation conferred-it is you&#xD;
with your refined and delicate tact. I am grate.&#xD;
ful with my whole heart, Imogene, while forced&#xD;
to decline your generous proposal I,'&#xD;
"But, my love, you had best consult Ardenne&#xD;
before you give me such a decided answer-he&#xD;
may think differently."&#xD;
Winny smiled, a soft, bright smile, and then&#xD;
she answered slowly,&#xD;
"Y3u may laugh at the triteness and namoy-&#xD;
parnbyism of what I am about to say, but Edgar&#xD;
and I have but one mind between us. I have&#xD;
only to listen to my own instincts to hear his&#xD;
sentiments. There comes Edgar, now, with&#xD;
two pails of water in his hands. You might&#xD;
now go to meet bim, and make the same propo-&#xD;
sition to him that you have just made to me.-&#xD;
He would feel your goodness and affection deeply&#xD;
as X do, and decline your proposition firmly as I&#xD;
did."&#xD;
&#xD;
bHANN&#xD;
Miss Summerfield received this decision with&#xD;
a look of deep disappointment. She mused in&#xD;
silence. She was not inclined to yield the point&#xD;
so easily.&#xD;
"Then how in the world is one to be of use&#xD;
to you ?" at last she asked&#xD;
"By doing everything to ameliorate our grand-&#xD;
mother's situation."&#xD;
"We do that, Winny, from another set of&#xD;
motives"&#xD;
"By reconciling my father ?"&#xD;
"We have tried in vain 1,'&#xD;
"By loving us yourself?"&#xD;
"1 do, my dear Winny, with all the heart I&#xD;
have."&#xD;
Tne entrance of Ardenne, with the pails. ar~&#xD;
rested the conversation Winuy arose, tilled her&#xD;
little kettle, hung it over the fire, and began t~ %et&#xD;
the table for tea. While she en, thui engage'.&#xD;
Miss Summerfield turned to Ardenne, and said,&#xD;
"I shall not return to Red-Stone to-night, Mr.&#xD;
Ardenne. Will you be so good as to send my&#xD;
servant home immediately, that mother may not&#xD;
be uneasy at this unexpected absence, and direct&#xD;
him, Mr. Ardenne, if you please, to return for&#xD;
me early to-morrow morning I"&#xD;
Ardenne bowed, and withdrew to do her bidding&#xD;
In the course of the evening Imogene renewed&#xD;
and pressed her proposal to Winny in vain. After&#xD;
tea, while Winny was absent in the adjoining&#xD;
bed-chamber, changing the bed-linen and prepa-&#xD;
ring it for Miss Summerfield's occupation, Imo-&#xD;
gene took the opportunity of speaking to Ar-&#xD;
deane apart, upon the subject of her cousin's&#xD;
falling health and great debility, and by every&#xD;
argument in her power to persuade him to ac&#xD;
cept their hospitality for the winter. Ardenne&#xD;
was affected with grief when she alluded to&#xD;
Winny's declining health, and, for lies, severe&#xD;
toils; he was moved with gratitude when line-&#xD;
gene used every delicate and ingenuous persua&#xD;
sion to induce him to go to Red-Stoue, but, in the&#xD;
end, with earnest expressions of gratitude and&#xD;
esteem, he declined the offer, requesting, as his&#xD;
decision was quite final, that it might not be re-&#xD;
peated. Imogene's scheme was relinquished very&#xD;
reluctantly.&#xD;
Soon after breakfast, the next morning, her&#xD;
servant rode up, leading her palfrey, and Miss&#xD;
Suminerfield bade good-bye to the Ardennes and&#xD;
Pine Cliffs.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXIII.&#xD;
JANUARY AT PINE CLIFFS.&#xD;
'Tis done! Dread winter spreads his, latest gloom&#xD;
And reigns tremendous o'e- the conquered year!&#xD;
How dead the vegetable kingdom lies!&#xD;
How dumh the tuneful! Horror wide extends&#xD;
lIfe desolate domain!          Thompson&#xD;
It was the middle 01 January. i~he moan-&#xD;

tains were covered with snow and ice; their&#xD;
gorges glistening with skeleton trees carved in&#xD;
ice; their hollows filled up with hills of snow&#xD;
drifts; the river far below them, frozen to the&#xD;
bottom, swollen and cracked open; the fields&#xD;
beyond a vast ocean of snow and ice, rolling off&#xD;
towards the cold, blue horizon, with spectral&#xD;
trees and houses standing here and there. Clouds&#xD;
darkened the sky.&#xD;
It was on the 15th of January. It had snowed&#xD;
all night. Edgar leaving Winny in her heavy,&#xD;
morning sleep, descended to the kitchen to open&#xD;
the window-shutters and light the fire. The&#xD;
cold was so intense, that in passing from their&#xD;
bed chamber to the kitchen his hands grew&#xD;
numb, heavy, and almost useless. He went to&#xD;
the window to open tbe shuttera-the snow had&#xD;
penetrated through the old shutters, filling up&#xD;
~the spac- bet.'-en them and the window, and&#xD;
I frozen there, excluding every ray of light, and&#xD;
making the room pitch dark. It was impossible&#xD;
I to raise the window without shattering the&#xD;
I glass, and so Edgar went to the door to open it&#xD;
and admit the light., The snow was drifted and&#xD;
frozen against the door, too, for he had to pull&#xD;
with all his strength two or three times, and&#xD;
then with the last pull it came violently, though&#xD;
heavily open, and then-it was still dark 1-and&#xD;
Edgar knew that a snow-drift had closed up the&#xD;
whole front ot the house. There was a baek&#xD;
door, but no back window to this kitchen-parlor.&#xD;
He went and opened the door, and then turning,&#xD;
saw in front, from sill to ceiling, a shining bar..&#xD;
ricade of frozen snow. It was still snowing and&#xD;
freezing as it fell. He closed the doors and&#xD;
lighted a candle Then he proceeded to kindle&#xD;
the fire-by its light you might have seen that&#xD;
our poor boy was frightfully changed-his face&#xD;
was pallid, peaked, haggard; his eyes and cheeks&#xD;
were hollow, the expression of his countenance&#xD;
despairing.--he might have been taken for the&#xD;
starved apothecary in Romeo and Juliet. He&#xD;
looked old, and our Edgar was but twenty. So&#xD;
much for a romantic name and a runaway watch.&#xD;
1 think if his sponsors in baptism had called him&#xD;
Job or Barnabas, or any substantial, respectable,&#xD;
broad-bottomed, upright and downright name,&#xD;
that he never would have grown up a sonnet&#xD;
scribbler, and eloped with nis pretty pupil-but&#xD;
to call him "Edgar!" I could have told them&#xD;
so.&#xD;
Reader! if you ever heard of an Edgar, or an&#xD;
Eriwin, who did not let his genius, or his pas-&#xD;
sions, or his demon fly away with him, and who&#xD;
on the contrary, grew up to be a useful, stout,&#xD;
and well fed member of society, I shall thank&#xD;
you to let me know it. There is a spell, a&#xD;
charm, a talisman in a name If .you want to&#xD;
make a girl a flirt, call her "Fanny," and the&#xD;
chances will be good; if you want to make her&#xD;
anything and everything n turn, and nothing&#xD;
long-a medley of inconsistencies-a cbaoa ~&#xD;

her original elements of fire and air, earth and&#xD;

Mr. Edgar was neither playing flutes nor&#xD;
writing sonnets. He was just filling the tea-&#xD;
kettle and sweeping the hearth-alas! just think&#xD;
of a "radiant archangel" sweeping up the hearth!&#xD;
In truth, this was the burnt bottom crust of&#xD;
their cake of romance! Well! this "burn-&#xD;
ing and shining light," who was going t~ blaze&#xD;
forth upon the dazzled world with the' splendor&#xD;
of a newly created sun !-waa just now the mas-&#xD;
ter of as dirty a pair of hands, as smut, cinders,&#xD;
smoke, and ashes could make, as he beat the&#xD;
little broom against the jambs, when the stair&#xD;
door opened and Winny appeared, blue and half&#xD;
frozen, though closely wrapped in her coarse&#xD;
plaid shawl; she smiled an affectionate good-&#xD;
morning, and set herself immediately to work at&#xD;
the table Poor Winny had, in spite of all her&#xD;
promises of reformation, overslept herself so&#xD;
often, that she was ashamed now of attempting&#xD;
an apology. She took a little corn meal and be-&#xD;
gan to mix a cake. The tea-kettle was boiling,&#xD;
and Edgar asked kier for the coffee.&#xD;
"There is none, Edgar; the last was used&#xD;
yesterday morning."&#xD;
e Tea, then; tea would do."&#xD;
"There is but one making, Edgar; and per-&#xD;
haps we had better save that, in case either of&#xD;
us should be sick."&#xD;
"It has come at last, then," said he, bitterly,&#xD;
(C the time when I see you without the common-&#xD;
est comforts of life, such as every negro enjoys,&#xD;
and see myself without the means of providing&#xD;
them for you."&#xD;
"Well, Edgarj we ar~ not without the neces-&#xD;
aarses of life-we have meal yet-that is a com-&#xD;
fort."&#xD;
"Meal I-and how much? Tell me that,&#xD;
Winny I"&#xD;
"Row much? Oh I enough to last us two or&#xD;
three days."&#xD;
"And-then, Winny ?"&#xD;
"And then-I do not know what then-that is&#xD;
God's concern I-not ours~ for we have done all&#xD;
we can"&#xD;
"Look around, Winny I-is there anything&#xD;
else to sell or barter for meal ?-your carpets&#xD;
and quilts, your sofa-everything gone except&#xD;
one straw bed, a kettle, griddle and two bowls-&#xD;
and now that we have been married fifteen&#xD;
months we -are reduced to positive penury-&#xD;
within a week perhaps of beggary or-"&#xD;
-       "8ta~vation ?-do people ever starve, Edgar?"&#xD;
(C Yes!"&#xD;
(C What? among their fellow creatures?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes-next door to people who are dying of&#xD;
luxurious surfeit I"&#xD;
"I cannot realize rt!~1&#xD;
"Do you realize that we are half buried in&#xD;
snow, and that this is only the rnid~le of Janu.&#xD;
ary ?"&#xD;
"Yes-but we have a good fire I"&#xD;
"Do you realize that we have not a cent and&#xD;
no means of getting a cent I-that we have no.&#xD;
thing between us and hunger but a little meal,&#xD;
and that is nearly gone?&#xD;
"Weil lit is likely we shalbbe hungry."&#xD;
"And how long do you think hunger may hint&#xD;
before it produces death ?"&#xD;
"I don't know-bow long ?"&#xD;
"A few days perhaps."&#xD;
"Well, Edgar, that is the Lord's affair-when&#xD;
a case is in extremity it is exclu.i~ely in the&#xD;
Lord's hands. Faith is 's~orih nothing, Edgar,&#xD;
that does not pierce the mystery of Do ith-if we&#xD;
are starved out of earth, which I cannot t~ink&#xD;
likely to happen, the eyes t~ at close here will&#xD;
open in heaven-i only pray to live till our child&#xD;
is born, and that will riot be mar y days~ and&#xD;
then let us all die together! Oh! to.sether, Ed.&#xD;
gart I have so much faith I should tot wisri you&#xD;
to live here, Edgar, ~i I dt'd I wish you to go&#xD;
with me to the 'Better Lan~l."'&#xD;
By this time the little torn cake was done,&#xD;
and she put it upon tie table. There was no&#xD;
cloth-it had been sold. There were only two&#xD;
common plates. ehy sat down to the table,&#xD;
and Edgar cut the corn bread into our quarters.&#xD;
1'hey ate but little-there was so much despair&#xD;
painted on both cou~,tenances Yet sac was&#xD;
sorrowing for the other. Ardenne had ever&#xD;
spoken so plainly, so roughly almost a h~ spoke&#xD;
now, and here was the secret! As soon ni the&#xD;
little meal was over, and Winny hid cleared the&#xD;
table-an easy task, and they sat down at the&#xD;
fire, she said,&#xD;
"It is because you have nothing to do, d.~ar&#xD;

In truth, Ardenne was almost bereft of his&#xD;
reason. They had struggled, and persevered, and&#xD;
economzed. Had done whatsoever their hands&#xD;
found to do, and sought work when it could not&#xD;
be found-had drawn their little expenses down&#xD;
to the smallest mijilmum-had practiced "indus-&#xD;
try, economy and temperance," those catholi-&#xD;
cons for success-unsuccessfully !-in short, had&#xD;
lived in a way that would have delighted the&#xD;
heart of "poor Richard"-and still their income&#xD;
and their little stock of personal property month&#xD;
by month diminished, until their house was&#xD;
nearly as bare as a shebelon tree that the locusts&#xD;
have deserted. Ardenne was in despair.&#xD;
routh is said to be hopeful, elastic. It is&#xD;
ig' orange rather that is elastic, hopeful! Souls&#xD;
that have never been prostrated with disap-&#xD;

receive a severe shock of disappointment, and&#xD;
there is nothing in life so death-like as its de-&#xD;
spair. It is middle age that is hopefi and elas-&#xD;
tic. Middle age that has seen the sky cloud up&#xD;
too often not to know that it will clear again-&#xD;
that has seen the sun set too many times not to&#xD;
expect its rise-seen the winter snows too fre-&#xD;
quently not to anticipate the spring. But youth,&#xD;
wira its intense sensibilities and passionate de-&#xD;
sires2-frost-bitten in the first "winter of our&#xD;
discontent," in despair believes too surely that&#xD;

CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
THE FATHER AND DAUGHTER. ,&#xD;
I could have stemmed misfortune's tide&#xD;
And borne the rich one's sneer,&#xD;
Ilaye braved the haughiy glance of pride,&#xD;
Nor shed a single tear.&#xD;
I I could have smiled on every blow&#xD;
I    From life's full quiver thrown,&#xD;
I While I mighi gaze on ihee and know&#xD;
I should not be "alone."&#xD;
I could-I think I could have brooked&#xD;
E'en for a time that thou&#xD;
Upon my fading face had looked&#xD;
With less of love than now;&#xD;
For then I should at least have felt&#xD;
The sweet hope still my own,&#xD;
To win thee back, and, whilst I dwelt&#xD;
On earth, be not alone.&#xD;
Nay, dearest, 'tie too much,-this heart&#xD;
Must break now thou sri gone:&#xD;
It must not be !-we may not part!&#xD;
I cannot live "alone !"  Mrs. Dinnies.&#xD;
Winny watched him through the window as&#xD;
as picked his way down the precipitous and icy&#xD;
mountain path, until he was lost to her view-&#xD;
then a cloud slowly gathered ovor her mind-s&#xD;
weight settled on her heart. She struggled&#xD;
against this in vain-blamed herself in vain.&#xD;
"Why, how weak I am-what a baby 1 am get-&#xD;
ting to be, to feel thus about Kdgar~s absence for&#xD;
a few hours-nonsense!" but then she sighed&#xD;
heavily, from a despair she could neither escape&#xD;
nor understand. She walked restlessly about the&#xD;
room-a crumpled letter lay upon the floor-she&#xD;
passed and trod on it several times-at any other&#xD;
time she would have stooped and picked it up,&#xD;
for she was an orderly little housekeeper; but&#xD;
now at last she kicked it out of the way and pur-&#xD;
sued her walk. Restless, restless still, she wan-&#xD;
dered from the kitchen into the shed, turned&#xD;
over all her little stock of cooking utensils, try-&#xD;
lug to conquer her depression by seeking some&#xD;
useful employment. They were all right. Then&#xD;
she went up stairs and over-hauled her own ahd&#xD;
Edgar's slender wardrobe. They were In per-&#xD;
fect repair. There was nothing for Winny to do&#xD;
unless she had possessed money to buy new ma-&#xD;
terials to work upon; but now, in tumbling over&#xD;
Edgar's clothes, she missed some of them from&#xD;
a closet that served them as a wardrobe. Far&#xD;
from suspecting the truth, she said, "Ah I poor&#xD;
Edgar, he has secretly taken some of his clothes&#xD;
to sell or to pledge; secretly, because he did not&#xD;
wish to hurt my feelings; what a good heart he&#xD;
&#xD;
with something like a newly kindled love of the&#xD;
work, Winny set herself to the exercise. Noon&#xD;
passed, day waned, Winny grew hungry, and&#xD;
there was nothing to eat; she walked about&#xD;
again restlessly, once more with her little foot&#xD;
twitched that soiled and crumpled, haunting let-&#xD;
ter out of her path. She sat down at last, fatigued&#xD;
in body, but still restless and active in mind.&#xD;
"Edgar must be here now in a few minutes-I&#xD;
will mend th~ fire!" and jumping up again, she&#xD;
~went to the d6@ a'nd looked out. There was no&#xD;
sign of Edgar yet. But the hill was abrupt just&#xD;
at the top; though unseen, he might be very near.&#xD;
She went into thashed and brought a small arm-&#xD;
ful of dry wood, such as she could bring. The&#xD;
fire was very low. She laid down her wood&#xD;
upon the hearth, and looked around for some-&#xD;
thing to start it with. Even waste paper was&#xD;
scarce with her. Her eyes lighted upon the&#xD;
crumpled letter-she stooped and picked it up,&#xD;
and opened to examine it previous to burning,&#xD;
when a sharp rap at the door startled her, and&#xD;
she dropped the paper! but before she had made&#xD;
a step forward to open the door, it was pushed&#xD;
open, and her stout father, in his brown surtout,&#xD;
furred cap, fox-skin gloves and heavy riding-&#xD;
whip, stood in the middle of the room stamping&#xD;
the snow from his boots and over-alls. With an&#xD;
inarticulate cry of joy, Winny's first impulse&#xD;
was to spring forward, but something jerked her&#xD;
back, and she stood fixed upon the spot where&#xD;
she had dropped the letter; she tried to speak,&#xD;
but her heart beat too violently; she lost her&#xD;
strength, and tottered off to the nearest chair&#xD;
and sank into it, while still the stout squire&#xD;
stamped and blew, apparently paying more at-&#xD;
tention to the condition of his over-ahla, than to&#xD;
his little daughter. With a great effort, with a&#xD;
sudden 4art, Winny sprang forward and was at&#xD;
his feet clasping his knees, burying her face&#xD;
against him and gulping out-&#xD;
"Father! Oh, may the Lord Almighty blest&#xD;
you for coming. Father, forgive me I I do love&#xD;
you ,0 dearly! Oh! I am so glad to see you!&#xD;
I nearly died of joy to see you-oh! and terror,&#xD;
toot Father! say you forgive me! I know by&#xD;
your coming that you have pardoned me, dear&#xD;
father, but just say so&#xD;
"Stop, Winny! Let me go, you absurd girl~&#xD;
don't you see you are hindering1me from stamp-&#xD;
ing the snow off, and that you are getting it all&#xD;
over yourself-leave off your nonsense and go&#xD;
and get ready-well! come! do you Iscatr me ?',&#xD;
"Sir ?" asked Winny, releasing her father, who&#xD;
immediately threw himself heavily into a chair&#xD;
that creaked under him. "Oh, father! dear ~a-&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes! ready, ready, READY! is that distinct&#xD;
enough? and be quick, too, for the sun is nearly&#xD;
down !"&#xD;
"Ready for what, my father 7"&#xD;
"For what? why for to return with me to&#xD;
Oak Grove, where we will see if we can keep a&#xD;
closer watch on you than we did two years ago,&#xD;
and see if we cannot try to prevent you from&#xD;
running away with any more lackeys.~~&#xD;
Winny's pale cheek flushed at this indignity,&#xD;
and withal her face assumed a puzzled and a&#xD;
troubladexpression-she did not move of course.&#xD;
"C6irne! come! will you hurry? It is a long&#xD;
ride from here to Oak Grove, and we have no&#xD;
moon. 1 have brought Sea Foam, and a stuffed&#xD;

she kicked it away. Winny thought she had        "Come, Winny; no fiddlestickiana, if you&#xD;
plenty of opportunity now to practice patience,  please! go and get ready I said."&#xD;
and learn her allotted lesson ~~TO WAIT,'~ and -  "Get ready. sir ?"&#xD;

"So! you don't know that my knave has run&#xD;

him to do I knew as long as you were a pretty&#xD;
girl, and a healthy girl, that he would stay with&#xD;
you, but when you came to this he would be off!&#xD;
Ha! lmighthave told youso! and nowif you&#xD;
want farther proof-here! read his own letter!&#xD;
the skulk asked me to give it to you, and I do it&#xD;
only because it is a good-bye-and-forever affair!"&#xD;
Winny took the letter, put it in her bosom,&#xD;
and rose up.&#xD;
"Why don't you read your letter? Where&#xD;
are you going ?"&#xD;
"To get ready.~~&#xD;
The words were so hard and curt, the lips so&#xD;
white that spoke them, that Squire Darling&#xD;
squinted at his daughter with something ap-&#xD;
proaching to intelligent scrutiny as she passed&#xD;
out. Very soon she returned in her riding habit&#xD;
and hat. He got up.&#xD;
"My God, how white and still you are, Winnyl&#xD;

tumbling towards home, apparently very well sank slowly over Hettie's arms, and slipped&#xD;
satisfied with his~perfos~rnance.           thence to the ground.&#xD;
"Father I Father, 1 say I" still screamed&#xD;
Ifettie, trying to raise the body.&#xD;
C H A P T E R X X V 1                The little, round landlord rolled himself in,&#xD;
'tHE RACE AND GOAL.             singing out-&#xD;
"What the deuce is ailing of you, Hettie,&#xD;
She stands, as stands the striolten deer, squealing there like a stuck pig ?"&#xD;
Checked midway in the fearful chase,   "Oh, father! Mrs. Ardenne I"&#xD;
When bursts upon it~ eye and ear         "Heigh I what?  Tkere-I said so I"&#xD;
-    The gaunt gray robber baying near        "She came atter him, to stop him I"&#xD;
Between it and its hiding-place- "I see that! I ain't blind, Hettie I I said&#xD;
While still behind, with yell and blow, so! I told 1dm so! blowed if I didn't I" said&#xD;
Sweeps like a storm the coming foe.&#xD;
.i. G.  ~       the little fellow, stupid with amazement, not.&#xD;
withstanding.&#xD;
Away I away! sped horse and rider, on the "Oh, father! sh.e'.r dead! sire's dead !"&#xD;
wines of lightning! Away! away! like a white "No she ain't I she's in a fainty-fit! or a&#xD;
meteor glancing through the dark path. She sound I Let me feel her pulse! No pulse!&#xD;
overtook and awept past a carriage too swiftly Her temples-no not a singly beating vein!&#xD;
to see the arms of the Sammerfield's painted upon Put your hand in her bosom, Hettie, and feel if&#xD;
Its panels. Away! away! as rook and tree5 her heart beats."&#xD;
&#xD;
8&#xD;
&#xD;
"No! no I no! father!" said Hettie, nervously&#xD;
running her hand hither and thither, like a&#xD;
~rigritened rabbit, in her friend's bosom. "No!&#xD;
father!, no! it is as still-as still as anytkissg!&#xD;
Oh, my goodness, skeXr dead! aiw's dead! Fa-&#xD;
flies! dont stand there, leaning on your knees,&#xD;
and staring your eyes out-don't! Help me to&#xD;
carry her in, and lay her on the bed! Don't you&#xD;
us she's dead 1-why don't you send for the&#xD;
doctor? Don't you see she's dead f)) exclaimed&#xD;
Het~ie, just as upset and as crazed as her father&#xD;
was stupified.&#xD;
"No! she is not dead!', sail a deep, sweet&#xD;
voice, near the group.&#xD;
Hettie turned, to see a gentleman in the long&#xD;
frock and square cap of a Catholic clergyman,&#xD;
standing near her.&#xD;
Just then the carriage that Winny had passed&#xD;
in her mad flight rolled into the yard. The lit.&#xD;
tie host, at the sound of wheels, and by the force&#xD;
of habit, started up to go and meet it, but&#xD;
checked the impulse, and would have raised&#xD;
Winny in his arms, but that the gentleman who&#xD;
ha i test spoken, now said-&#xD;
"Ge meet your new guests, Mr. Smile, 1&#xD;
will attend this young lady," and raising her&#xD;
nightly, he looked to Hettie for direction.&#xD;
"This way, sir," said Hettie, leading the&#xD;
way into a little chamber.&#xD;
"Indeed be is the very image of Miss Sum.&#xD;
snerfield! He looks enough like Miss Summer-&#xD;
field to be her father," said Hettie, to herself, as&#xD;
she gazed at the stranger, unconsciously, with&#xD;
such intensity that he fixed his large shadowy&#xD;
eyes, with their slowly returning light upon her&#xD;
an instant, and then gave his attention to the&#xD;
recovering of the poor one prostrate before him.&#xD;
In the meantime Mr. Smile had gone into the&#xD;
yard to receive the new arrival just as the car-&#xD;
riage stopped. The footman jumped off, opened&#xD;
the door, let down the steps, and assisted Mrs.&#xD;
Summerfield to alight. Cap in hand, and bowing&#xD;
low, my little host rolled forward to meet her.&#xD;
"Is Mr. Vellemont here, sir ?"&#xD;
'~ Not as I know of, madam I A strange gen-&#xD;
tleman-a priest, is here-just this instant ap&#xD;
peared-and that's all I know of him-don't&#xD;
know how he came, nor where he came from,&#xD;
nor what his name is-he may be the gentleman&#xD;
in question 1-walk in, madam! Here, Hettie,&#xD;
my child I" Tkat call was mechanical also&#xD;
The little host always made an ostentatious&#xD;
show of calling out-" Here, Hettie, my daugh&#xD;
ter," whenever the arrival of ladies or a lady&#xD;
gave him an excuse to do so-as if he were al-&#xD;
ways proud of having a "Hettie, my daughter,"&#xD;
to sing after.&#xD;
"Where is Mr. Vehement? Let him know&#xD;
that I am here," said Mrs. Summerfield, when&#xD;
she reached the parlor.&#xD;
"Yes, madam! yes I-you mean the gentle-&#xD;
sian I told you of?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Certainly! Mr. Vellemont, the priest, who&#xD;
has been appointed to assist Father Burleigh,&#xD;
who is too infirm to perform his duties any&#xD;
longer."&#xD;
"Oh, yes, madam! I see f Will you, madam,&#xD;
have your horses taken from the carriage 1"&#xD;
"No, Smilie, I return immediately to Red..&#xD;
Stone, haviiig come only to meet and fetch over&#xD;
Mr. Vellemont."&#xD;
"Yes, madam I-there is another person here,&#xD;
who-"&#xD;
"Hurry, Smilie, if you please, it is late."&#xD;
"Yes! yes, ma'am I yes!" smiled the obliging&#xD;
little host, hastening out to do her bidding.&#xD;
Winny was at length shocked from her Insets..&#xD;
sibility by a fierce, rising pang, lsk~l forked and&#xD;
scattering lightning I-followed by another and&#xD;
another, in maddening strength and rapidity, U-&#xD;
til her senses were again whirled away, and&#xD;
lost in this vhastly storm of physical agony I&#xD;
Then followed a sense of sudden relief-exhaus..&#xD;
tion-thenlethargy~deatb.....an~ih~ati0~. From&#xD;
this trance she awoke at last with a feeling&#xD;
of benign repose-of inexpressible, exquisite,&#xD;
ineffable ease. The soft, elastic swells of a&#xD;
down bed and~pilows embraced her fragile form,&#xD;
A subdued, an even light fell sweetly on her&#xD;
eyes. A gently reviving fragrance filled the&#xD;
room. The soothing murmur of distant waters&#xD;
was heard And all-the shaded light-the de..&#xD;
locate fragrance-the murmuring sound-all&#xD;
came subdued to the senses of her who lay there&#xD;
half lost in a bathos of ineffable delight. She&#xD;
awoke to a sense of almost voluptuous-repose-&#xD;
to a quiet, delicious, animal life-she was like &amp;amp;&#xD;
new born babe, waking from its first sleep in its&#xD;
soft cradle-thought, memory, reason, had not&#xD;
stirred yet. She had not moved yet, though her&#xD;
sweet blue eyes were halt open, and floating in&#xD;
the shade of a vague, luxurious vision. This&#xD;
was beatitude. In this dreamy heaven of soft&#xD;
support, of shade, of murmur, and of faint fra..&#xD;
grande, she was now conscious of something&#xD;
more tangible than either-it was a touch,&#xD;
a warmth-a gentle, but thrilling clasp upon her&#xD;
left hand, that lay upon the counterpane. She&#xD;
felt that this touch had brought her back from&#xD;
death-that this warmth had given life-this&#xD;
gentle clasp had galvanized her deadened nerves,&#xD;
and started her still blood into circulation agaus&#xD;
-that the little sinews of her small arm were&#xD;
delicate electric Wires, conducting the life si&#xD;
that touch to heart and brain, and waking them&#xD;
to consciousness. She was awake now I-..lif~&#xD;
was upon her again I-the world before her ones&#xD;
more I But she received it with the feebleness&#xD;
of a young infant. She turned her swimming&#xD;
glance-the dark, shrouded figure, and pale, spi..&#xD;
ritual face of the- silent watcher did not eases&#xD;
her either surprise or joy-she was too weak te&#xD;

feel either-to feel anything but affection, a&#xD;
she murmured, in a soft, low tone-&#xD;
"Gancmother."&#xD;
"What, my baby ?" replied the watcher&#xD;
catching to the side of the bed, and helping her&#xD;
self up, and bending over a lace full of simple&#xD;
love, upon the languid one.&#xD;
Both, seemed too feeble, in mind and body, oni&#xD;
from illness, one from age, to feel any strong&#xD;
emotion at this meeting.&#xD;
"Grandmother."&#xD;
"Well, honey I"&#xD;
"Is this you ?"&#xD;
"Yes, honey, this is me."&#xD;
"Kiss me, grandmother."&#xD;
"Yes, honey,~~ and the old lady bent over ant&#xD;
pressed a kiss on her lips.&#xD;
"Bless me, grandmother."&#xD;
"God love my baby."&#xD;
~t Now I'll go to sleep," and she closed hei&#xD;
eyes again, to open them shortly.&#xD;
"Grandmother."&#xD;
"What, honey ?"&#xD;
"Am I awake, or asleep ?"&#xD;
"I think you are awake,-honey, ain't you V1&#xD;
"Yes, I reckon so-but where am I 1"&#xD;
C~In Margaret's room, honey."&#xD;
~cWhere 7"&#xD;
"In Margaret's room, you know, honey."&#xD;
"At Red-Stone Hall 7"&#xD;
"Yes, honey."&#xD;
"Well, good-night, grandmother-I am going&#xD;
to sleep, now," an.d a second time she closed her&#xD;
eyes, and dream and reality mingled together in&#xD;
her vague consciousness. Presently she awoke&#xD;
again-it was dark now~ except where a feeble&#xD;
yellow ray from the hearth showed where the&#xD;
night-taper burned. She murmured-" Grand.&#xD;
mother."&#xD;
"Do you want anything, dear Winny ?"&#xD;
"Who spoke?"&#xD;
"1, yofrr Cousin Imogene-how do you feel,&#xD;
Winny ?"&#xD;
"So nice."&#xD;
"I am so glad-can you eat something now,&#xD;
dearV'&#xD;
"Imogene I"&#xD;
"Well, my cousin ?"&#xD;
"Was grandmother here, just now, or was it&#xD;
a pleasant dream ?"&#xD;
"She was here, just now. We sent the car-&#xD;
riage for her as soon as you arrived. We knew&#xD;
that we could induce her to come, at last, it she&#xD;
heard that you were here."&#xD;
"Where is grandmother ?"&#xD;
if She has been sitting by you all day, but&#xD;
aew we have persuaded her to go to bed, and&#xD;
let me take her place by your bedside."&#xD;
"Where is Edgar, Imogene 7"&#xD;
No voice answered, nor was the question now&#xD;
wpeated. After a few moments-&#xD;
"Will you take anything, dearest Winny 7"&#xD;
&#xD;
o NDALE.                                                                        SHANNO&#xD;

forever more I"&#xD;
Long, long had Winny's tears been frozen, now&#xD;
at this sun of sympathy, eloquence, inspiration,&#xD;
they melted and ran down her face. Still her at-&#xD;
tention was not fixed-only arrested-unsettled&#xD;
aiid wandering in sad reveries and fancies, for&#xD;
turning her tear-bathed fa.ce to Imogene, she&#xD;
murmured,&#xD;
"Are you then that Angel of Sorror 'with&#xD;
saddened brow and pitying eye?' Are you that&#xD;
Angel of Sorrow who presided at my marriage&#xD;
and presided over my maternity-I do not say.&#xD;
'come.' but depart from me, Angel of Sorrow,&#xD;
for the shadow of your wing hides from me the&#xD;
face of God I"&#xD;
One day in a more rational and practical mood&#xD;
she asked-&#xD;
"Imogene-was no effort made to recall him?&#xD;
I mean-because I was so 111,-so near death,&#xD;
Imogene, and you were so good I,'&#xD;
"My dear, yes-we wrote to Wheeling by the&#xD;
very next mail, and thinking that perhaps he&#xD;
might not get the letter soon enough did not&#xD;
wait the next stage, but dispatched a messen-&#xD;
ger on horse-back to Wheeling for him. How-&#xD;
ever before our messenger arrived he had left&#xD;
Wheeling no one knew whither."&#xD;
"And so you abandoned the chase?"&#xD;
"Yes, my dcar Winny, but not the purpose.&#xD;
~dy mother caused notices to be inserted in all&#xD;
~he papers throughout the country to 'E-r&#xD;
~-e, late of Jefferson county, Va.,' recalling&#xD;
aim on important business. As yet, Winny,&#xD;
hose notices have been unproductive, flow.-&#xD;
~ver, only a few weeks have passed as yet. The&#xD;
intices are to be continued until further orders,&#xD;
Lnd he cannot fail to meet one or more of them."&#xD;
~" Unless he has lost himself in the boundless&#xD;
lV~stern wilderness, which is the most likely of&#xD;
LII."&#xD;
There was a coldness and quietness in her&#xD;
:one and manner that proved Wanny was n~&#xD;
herself yet.&#xD;
"He was crazy, Imogene, mad, maddened by&#xD;
seing say privations and fearing for me-or he&#xD;
vould not have thrown me into worse affliction&#xD;
~y flying."&#xD;
To. turn her thoughts away, Miss Summerfield&#xD;
aid,&#xD;
"Your father is much better, Whiny."&#xD;
No answer.&#xD;
"I told you several times that in pursuing you&#xD;
is had been thrown from his horse and severely&#xD;

No answer.&#xD;

"Are you not glad he is recovered, my dear?'&#xD;
"No."&#xD;
"What, Winny, not glad to hear your fathe&#xD;
is better I"&#xD;
"No."&#xD;
"You shock me, Winny l"&#xD;
"You should not have asked me, then. Mj&#xD;
father took my heart between his large strong&#xD;
hands and pressed it until it was numb. Ai&#xD;
first I screamed with the pain, but now I feel ac&#xD;
more-it is numb! Indeed it is, Imogene-it i!&#xD;
strange-but it is numb, stunned, silent !"&#xD;
While even they spoke old Gelly entered witi&#xD;
a letter in her hand.&#xD;
"Mornia' Miss .Winnyhow you 4o to-day&#xD;

"Be careful, Angela, you talk at random 1 and&#xD;

tricks of listening at key holes and adding to all&#xD;
that he hears there I"&#xD;
"Yes, honey. Well, honey, I hope it's true-&#xD;
that's all. Now, Miss Winny, when you done a&#xD;

"Did you say Uncle Kill wan down stairs ?"&#xD;
"Yes', honey."&#xD;
"Tell him to come up."&#xD;
"Yes, honey.~~&#xD;
And the old woman left the room. Winny's&#xD;
eyes fell again upon the letter in her hands. It&#xD;
ran thus-&#xD;
Oak Grove, March 1st, 18-.&#xD;
Winny, my child!&#xD;
How are you, my dear child?&#xD;
Your ba'y is six weeks old-are you well enough&#xD;
to come to me? I have sent the large close car-&#xD;
riage wito the duwn pillars and eider down com-&#xD;
forter triat was your mother's. I have had your&#xD;
mother'. r-.om fixed up for you very nicely-and&#xD;
1 bays engaged your favorite, Hetrie Smilue, here&#xD;
as your companion. Hstr.ie has thought of every-&#xD;
thing that I nad forgotten. That beautiful satin-&#xD;
wood cr ti that was your grandmother's and then&#xD;
your mother's, is placed by your bed. You snaIl&#xD;
have your choice of all hue young mulatto girl'&#xD;
on tbe plantation as a nurse for your child. I&#xD;
shall have a garden chair for you to take exer-&#xD;
cise in until you are able to ride out every day.&#xD;
I would seid He'ttie to ride home witri you, only&#xD;
you will need to lie down in the carriage, and&#xD;
there is no more than enough room for the pil-&#xD;
lows, yourself and baby. I would come for you&#xD;
anyselt, my child, but I am as yet unable to leave&#xD;
&#xD;
ONDALE.&#xD;

very iIl.-at death's door-yes, at deaths door,&#xD;

want to bug my little yellow haired girl again.&#xD;
Your father, grieving for you,&#xD;
JARED DARLING.&#xD;
If you had seen the face of Winny as she read&#xD;
this letter-the strange, cold, sardonic smile tnat&#xD;
quivered on her lips, you might have guessed&#xD;
what a frightful change WRONG had wrought in her&#xD;
angel disposition. Sce opened the sheet and&#xD;
turning the blank page, asked Imogene to lend&#xD;
her her pencil--and Misg Sumrnerfield, taking&#xD;
the gold pencil from her belt, handed it to Winny,&#xD;
watching with uneasiness the frosty smile upon&#xD;
the grI's lips as she wrote. Winny finished her&#xD;
note written with a pencil on the reverse side of&#xD;
her father's letter, and folding, directed it. She&#xD;
laid it down on the corner of the dressing-table&#xD;
ready for Kill. Imogene took it up.&#xD;
"May I read it, Winny ?"&#xD;
She nodded an indifferent assent. Imogene's&#xD;
sentiment of reverence made her shudder as she&#xD;
read-&#xD;
"When you have found and restored to me the&#xD;
life of my life, my husband-when you will ex-&#xD;
tend to him an equal welcome with mt-self-then&#xD;
I will come to you and not till then. You need&#xD;
send no more letters, for I will receive none&#xD;

Monday morning, I. SUMMERFIEIJD.&#xD;
Sealing this letter, Imogene returned to Win..&#xD;
ny's chamber. She found h-r in conversation&#xD;
with old Kill, who was almost crying for delight&#xD;
at again seeing "Miss Winny." He received&#xD;
the note from Miss Sammerfield, and turning to&#xD;
Winny said,&#xD;
"Now, Miss Winny, honey, what must I tell&#xD;

"The note has everythig, Achilles."&#xD;
"Yes, honey I yes, yes! I knows that, too. I&#xD;

"Will you do as I desire Achilles ?" sa d Miss&#xD;
Summerfi~ld, with that in -incible air of h sughti-&#xD;
ness arid authority wliicn she sometitI re but&#xD;
very seldom assumed. Old Kill bowed lowly,&#xD;
tu ned around hessatungly, and left the ct mber.&#xD;
"Now, Winny I" said Mirs Summerfiehi, when&#xD;
she had dismissed the old man, "now, Winny,&#xD;
recline on this lounge, while I sit here and talk&#xD;
to you. Do you intend to cultivate that sort of&#xD;
spirit towards your father ?"&#xD;
"I do not cultivate it. He drove Edgar, poor&#xD;
Edgar, who was so young-mad, and to an act of&#xD;
madness-never in his senses would he have left&#xD;
me. I feel, as I said-or to speak more truly, I&#xD;
have ceased to feel-as I told you before. 1 can-&#xD;
not help it."&#xD;
"Winny I" said she, passing her hand once or&#xD;
twice across her brow, as though she was con-&#xD;
scious of speaking as much of herself as of ano-&#xD;
ther; "Winny, it is difficult to govern thought;&#xD;
nearlyy impossible to govern feeling; but ACTION&#xD;
is, with few exceptions, entirely under our con-&#xD;
trol. ~iYou cannot, perhaps, at once, conquer and&#xD;
expelthat impious feeling of resentment-"&#xD;
"It is not resentment-it is no feeling at&#xD;
all."&#xD;
"It is the remit of resentment, however I&#xD;
Well I then, you cannot force a filial affection that&#xD;
you do not feel--and it would be wrong to affect&#xD;
what has no existence; but, Winny, you can&#xD;
pay your father filial attention and duty; still ; -&#xD;
you can, as soon as you are able, return to his&#xD;
house."&#xD;
"Imogene, if I weary you, I can return to my&#xD;
mountain cabin."&#xD;
"We have not, deserved that at your lips,&#xD;
cousin."&#xD;
*    "Well, then, do not speak to me of returning&#xD;
to my father's tousel Imogene, look at me! I&#xD;
* am not the same being that I was two months&#xD;
- - ago I yet you talk to me without regard-to the&#xD;
revolution in which I have lost my individuality!&#xD;
I once told you I loved this earth better than&#xD;
Heaven-that I always wished to stay just here&#xD;
on earth, and never wished a better heaven! I&#xD;
love this earth no longer! I wonder how I ever&#xD;

and running over of agony of body and anguishol&#xD;
mind! Oh! I loathe it! take it from me! Give&#xD;
me the peaceof nonentity."&#xD;
"'The peace of nonentity,"' replied Imogeno,&#xD;
as though she, too, were tempted to sigh for it-&#xD;
"But, dearest Winny you are not changed, only&#xD;
your environments. The earth is the same at&#xD;
midnietit rhat it was at noon-only the light is&#xD;
gone Night has darkened all your spirit, Win-&#xD;
ny, but you are not changed I"&#xD;
"Am I not? Listen! You know-for you&#xD;
have heard it from others-tnat I carry in my&#xD;
bosom a slow dearh wound, inflicted by my&#xD;
father! Well, for that I never felt a single spark&#xD;
of resentment-although I nave suffered by that&#xD;
wound. Well, no matter! that is a secret be-&#xD;

Nevertheless you must listen to me. Never miii~&#xD;

the church. "1 prefer to remain with my cou-&#xD;

mother when any proposition to accompany her&#xD;
to Chapel was made, and Mrs. Summerfield, with&#xD;
an intense gaze into the eyes that ever f.il be&#xD;
fore that ['ok would sigh and go on alone.&#xD;
Imogene labored now for one object; she knew&#xD;
that Squire Darling was rapidly recovering, she&#xD;
knew that upon the first day that he could vent&#xD;
ture to ride so far, he would come over to see&#xD;
Winny; she wished to prepare Winny to meet&#xD;
him, if not with affection, at least without be-&#xD;
traylog aversion.&#xD;
But a teariul change was coming over Winny.&#xD;
It vas now the week before the commence-&#xD;
ment of Lent. It had been the time honored&#xD;
custom of the Catholics of this neighborhood&#xD;
to give a succasioil of dinner and tea-parties for&#xD;
a week or two previous to Lent Tnis wasp I&#xD;
suppose, a sort of ofl~pring of the south of Eu-&#xD;
rope Carnival Be that as it may, it was their&#xD;
custom, and so about ten days before Shrove&#xD;
Tuesday, Mrs Summerfield sent out invita'ions&#xD;
for a large dinner party. Among the invite&#xD;
guests of course were Squire Darling and hi.:&#xD;
g protege, Miss Hinton, whose continnert.&#xD;
dence under his roof was sanctioned by the&#xD;
presence of a respectahie matron engaged to&#xD;
k~~p house and nurse him during his convales&#xD;
cence. In her iiote to her brother, M's. Su o-&#xD;

able to bear the motion of the carriage, ride&#xD;
over some days before the dinner party, and re&#xD;

ed b rival of Squire Darling in parson,&#xD;
look ewhat thinner and paler than when&#xD;
we las saw him in the arrogance of full blood&#xD;
ed health and strength. Indeed, instead of his&#xD;
brown surtout coat buttoned up, looking like an&#xD;
ov~r-rtuffed bag of woni, it hung rather genteel-&#xD;
ly upon him, so that Harry Joy, whom he, had&#xD;
met on the road, and who in her genial bon-&#xD;
homie, had quite forgiven rudeness and all&#xD;
his sundry other sins-told him he should text&#xD;
order a dandy coat from his tailor. Well!&#xD;
Squire Darling alighted carefully and cautiously&#xD;
from his carriage, and leaning on his stick and&#xD;
assisted by his body-servant, went up the stairs&#xD;
at Red-Stone I-mu, where he was liludly received&#xD;
by Mrs. Summerfield; his long and dangerous&#xD;
illness having quite softened the sister's heart&#xD;
toW ~tls him.&#xD;
I, how me at once where to find my child,&#xD;
M~rgaret - you have been a mother to her,&#xD;
Margaret, may God reward you for it," said the&#xD;
squire, as he limped after his sister.&#xD;
Mrs Summertield led him at once up stairs, and&#xD;
Opening a bark chamber door said.&#xD;
"My dear Wiiiny! here is your father," ad-&#xD;
&#xD;
mitred hun, and closing the door again, retired,&#xD;
leaving the father and daughter alone&#xD;
It was a smaf I, luxurious, but sombre chamber,&#xD;
A soft (ark carpet on the fior; the walls hung&#xD;
with a dark blue velvet paper. A tent bed.&#xD;
stead stood at one end, a large bay window at&#xD;
the other, a fire-place and grate, with two large&#xD;
easy chairs occupied the third bide, and a dark&#xD;
mahogany bureau and dressing-glass the fourth;&#xD;
the bedstead and window were hung with dark&#xD;
blue damask, and the chairs covered with the&#xD;
same rich but sombre drapery. Over the fire-&#xD;
place hung a fine large oil painting of the Ma-&#xD;
donna Doloroso, by Correggio. When the door&#xD;
closed on Squire Darling, leaving him in this&#xD;
still, shadowy blue room, at first the sudden&#xD;
change from noonday without to twilight with-&#xD;
in, nearly blinded him, and it was some seconds&#xD;
before he could make out a slight fragile form,&#xD;
clad in white and faintly gleaming among the&#xD;
dark blue pillows of a large easy chair, drawn&#xD;
up near the fire. He approached the chair and&#xD;
looked again before he could, before he dared to&#xD;
recognize that blue-white shade as his daugh-&#xD;
ter, then he burst into tears. and without a word&#xD;
dropped his stick, sunk down upon the carpet&#xD;
and dropping his head upon the arm of her chair,&#xD;
wept bitterly. "When pride thaws look for&#xD;
floods" And yet h'- saw only the physical ruin,&#xD;
he did not guess, perhaps he never could have&#xD;
understood, the moral paralysis. And there she&#xD;
sat, motionless, cold, imps-able. indeed like a&#xD;
spirit or th picture of a spirit; that tempest of&#xD;
tears making no more impression than if indeed&#xD;
she had been a shape of mist At last:&#xD;
"Winny! Winny! Wirings! Oh, my mother-&#xD;
less child! my dying child! speak to me-eo4~t&#xD;
don't you speak to me, Winny ?"&#xD;
"Father."&#xD;
He took the pocket-handkerchief from him&#xD;
pocket and wiped the tears and perspiration that&#xD;
streamed from his face-drew a convulsive,&#xD;
shuddering sigh, and tottered up on his feet-&#xD;
"Winny! Winny I my dear child; say some-&#xD;
thing to me, or I shall believe you dead already!&#xD;
Winny! speak to me, Winny I"&#xD;
~C Father, will you take that other chair ?"&#xD;
"And is that all? My God! how cold and&#xD;
quiet you are! and this is the first time we have&#xD;
met since we both were so near death!" bit-&#xD;
terly said the father, as be sank heavily into&#xD;
his chair. She replied nothing, looked nothing.&#xD;
Be was not in the habit of controlling any emo-&#xD;
tion; he did not try to regain his composure--&#xD;
but the perfect quietude of her manner acted&#xD;
upon his nerves, reducing them to something like&#xD;
calmness. They both sat some time in perfect&#xD;
silence-he gazing at her in a sort o~ still ex-&#xD;
citement; his gaze disturbing her as little as it&#xD;
would have disturbed the Madonna Doloroso&#xD;
above the mantle-piece. At last he broke out&#xD;
again,&#xD;

' My G d, Winny! what is t"is? this is worse&#xD;

their friends, man you have for your father!&#xD;
Winny! are you armrry, and unforgiving ?"&#xD;
This question, the nature of which would have&#xD;
shocked ncr reverence some months ago, did not,&#xD;
however, affect her now. When it was repeated,&#xD;
she replied,&#xD;
"No, father"&#xD;
"What is it then, my shadow? Oh, my poor&#xD;
shadow, what is it?"&#xD;
"Nothing."&#xD;
"'Nothing!' heavens! how impenetrable you&#xD;

will arouse you, if anything will. Winny! 1&#xD;

"In the crib, in the corner, father!"&#xD;
"Ah, it is so dark in this gloomy room, I can-&#xD;

"Wail you band it to me, father? I have not&#xD;

"They are all kindness. 1 prefer it See,&#xD;

I want anything, I have only to ring it."&#xD;
He now got up, and going to the corner, lifted&#xD;
the child from the crib and brought it to his&#xD;
daughter. He laid it on her lap. "Why, Win-&#xD;
nyit is all quietness, like yourself! Why Win-&#xD;

"I do not nurse her!"&#xD;
"Not! not nurse her?"&#xD;
"No. I have no milk for her-never had&#xD;

"Oh II see! I see," said the father, with his&#xD;
voice full of pity. "Yes, I see! poor little mo-&#xD;

No reply.&#xD;
"Say, is it not, my dear child? you love it&#xD;

"'No,' again! My God! what! 'No'-did&#xD;

"'Numb I" and what may that mean; Heaven I&#xD;

"Listen, father. I tell you what is true. It&#xD;

"For instance, now?" inquired the wretched&#xD;
ether, fixing his eyes on hip coild, and gulp.&#xD;

"Why, father, when you used to smile upon&#xD;

"Oh-h-h-h heaven!"&#xD;
"Y.s, fat her, don't groan. You call it LIGHT5&#xD;

"Oh-h-h-h, Winny, my child, my child!"&#xD;
"1 know more, father. I know I can't love,&#xD;
because I have got nothing to love through-my&#xD;
heart you see, is broken down,-could 1 see if my&#xD;
eyes we'e out, father ?-weil, but this is what I&#xD;
know-that. I shall die-that my spirit will leave&#xD;

and that it will be clothed with a new incorrup-&#xD;
tible body-with a new heart that can never be&#xD;
broken~ hud that with tlsat I shall again worship&#xD;
God and ova you, Edgar, my baby-all people.&#xD;
I used to believe this because the priest said it&#xD;

" Oh&amp;amp;?~snj-child! my child !"&#xD;
~~I' knw more, father-and oh, listen, lest I&#xD;

new things, for knowledge comes so fast-it&#xD;
flows on and on-and the new drives out the old&#xD;
-and I want you to remember this."&#xD;
"Oh-h-b-h!"&#xD;
&#xD;
"As myheart and my affections were destroy-&#xD;

stroyed by.~rong, by injustice, by slander, by&#xD;
neglect, by itial-education-and you call the&#xD;
Heart de~rave,4, corrupt, perverted, and so it is,&#xD;
but ~not the spi-it! Father, It is the spirit that&#xD;
suffers-at death, freed from its ruined and mal-&#xD;
tteated body, it will be redeemed, freed, clothed&#xD;

T is gives me no joy now, father! it is cold&#xD;

get a new, whole heart, I shall be glad of it in&#xD;
heaven, and I say this as a blind child would&#xD;

Again Squire Darling groaned bitterly, then as&#xD;
his child did not speak again, he seized her hand&#xD;
-iopins-ves hoping to find fever there to ac-&#xD;
count for this fearful wandering of the, mind, but&#xD;
no, her pulee was even and rather slow. lie&#xD;
picked up his stick, and fait as his remaining&#xD;
lameness would allow, he hurried from the cham-&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVIII.&#xD;
NIGHT IN DAY.&#xD;
The mmd that broods o'er guilty woes&#xD;
Is like the scorpion girt by fire,&#xD;
In circle narrowing as it glows,&#xD;
The flames around iheir c~.pmive close.&#xD;
Till inly scorched by thousand throes,&#xD;
And maddened in her ire,&#xD;
One sad and sole relief she knows,&#xD;
The sting she nourished for her foes,&#xD;
Whose venom never yet was vain,&#xD;
Gives but one pang and curt-s all pain&#xD;
And darts into her desperate brain.&#xD;
So do the dark in soul expire,&#xD;
Or live like scorpion girl by fir&amp;amp;;&#xD;
So writhes the soul remor~e hath riven-&#xD;
Unfit for earib-undoomed for heaven--&#xD;
Darkness above-despair beneath--&#xD;
Around it flame-beneath it death.&#xD;
Byron.&#xD;
Immediately upon leaving Squire Darling at&#xD;
the door of his daughter's chamber, Mrs. Sum-&#xD;
merfield had passed down the long, dividing hail,&#xD;
with the intention of seeking a private interview&#xD;
with Imogene. In truth, Mrs. Summerfield had&#xD;
parental griefs of her own, and not, as in Squire&#xD;
Darling's instance, of her own creation. What&#xD;
hand had she, in fact, in producing the great sor-&#xD;
row that was day by day visibly consuming the&#xD;
health and flesh and beauty-the very life of&#xD;
Imogene? she who was "innocent of the know-&#xD;
ledge" of its cause. Her heart was even more&#xD;
than usually oppressed upon this day. It could&#xD;
not have been otherwise. Since the prepara-&#xD;
tions for this large dinner party commenced,&#xD;
Miss Summerfield had fallen into deeper gloom-&#xD;
health, flesh and life had wasted with greater&#xD;
end fearful rapidity. She had forsaken even&#xD;
Wiarty. She died hourly. Mrs. Summerfield&#xD;
opened the door of her daughter's chamber and&#xD;
entered. She paused a few steps from the cen-&#xD;
tre of the room, arrested by a still picture-still&#xD;
but full of tumult, like a painting of a battle, ox&#xD;
of a tempest.&#xD;
Imogene's chamber was beautiful and luxuri-&#xD;
ous-it was all that great wealth, an artist's&#xD;
taste, and a mother's love could make it. It&#xD;
was the largest front room. T wo lofty windows&#xD;
from ceiling to floor, opening upon a balcony,&#xD;
commanded a view of the Snenandoafi and the&#xD;
mountains beyond. But these windows were&#xD;
now shaded by curtains of purple satin damask,&#xD;
lined with orange colored silk. The space be-&#xD;
tween the windows was filled up with a large&#xD;
Raphael, a Virgin and Child surmounting a smell&#xD;
but elegant altar.&#xD;
Before tbis altar knelt Imogene, her hands&#xD;
clasped, her face upraised, her lips struck apart,&#xD;
her brow corrugated, her eyes srrained~nay, her&#xD;
very ringlets bristling as it Were with anguish.&#xD;
Yes! there was grief, remorse, terror, despair,&#xD;

still and stormy and terrible as the picture of a  "Yes, GUILT !~ I dare not go to confession! I&#xD;

"It is I, Imogene !" said the half heart-broken  "Lost girl! repent! repent I"&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIX.&#xD;
DAT IN NIGHT.&#xD;
Oh! lightly, lightly tread!&#xD;
A holy thing is sleep,&#xD;
On ihe worn spirit shed,&#xD;
And e~ cc that wake to weep.&#xD;
A holy thing from heaven,&#xD;
A gracios, dewy cloud,&#xD;
A covering mantle given&#xD;
The weary to enshroud.&#xD;
Oh! lightly, lightly trend !"-&#xD;
Revere that fair, still brow,&#xD;
The nicely d~ooping head,&#xD;

That call the slumberer back,&#xD;
From the world un~cen by you,&#xD;
Unto life's dim, faded track.&#xD;
Hennzns.&#xD;
Mm. Surnmerfield could not sleep that night.&#xD;
"I wonder if she sleeps? alas, no! she lies&#xD;
and tosses as I do! How many nights, my&#xD;
heaven! has that poor girl waked and suffered!&#xD;
night after night, and week after week, yes! and&#xD;
month succeeding month, until health and flesh&#xD;
and beauty have wasted away! and my child is&#xD;
haggard at nineteca! I will go and see if she&#xD;
sleeps I" and so saying, Mrs. Summerfield arose,&#xD;
slipped on a dressing gown, took the shaded night&#xD;
taper and crossing the passage, entered imo-&#xD;
gene's chamber. It was very quiet. She list"&#xD;
ened. There wait no sound, no motion, no sigh;&#xD;
nothing to suggest that the occupant of the&#xD;
chamber waked. Mrs. Summorfield approached&#xD;
the bed-gradually ani cautiously advanced the&#xD;
light-started! almost exclaimed with surprise&#xD;
at what she saw! she approached the taper&#xD;
again and looked more intently. Was that imo-&#xD;
gene? That the girl "steeped to the lips in&#xD;
gtil" and haggard with remorse? That! Mrs.&#xD;
Snmnmerfild turned the cylinder of the taper,&#xD;
ralilag a strong light, and flashing it upon the&#xD;
sleeper. Was that Imogene, the girl so lately&#xD;
can~umod with guilt and remorse? What, that&#xD;
radiant sleeper flooded with the glory of some&#xD;
celestial vision? Yes! that was truly Imogene,&#xD;
transfigured and glorified in sleep! how beauti-&#xD;
ful she looked! and how happy! even to ecstacy.&#xD;
The cover was thrown off her boaom-~the beau-&#xD;
tiful bosom only slightly veiled by ~he long&#xD;
binek ringlets that glided and twined caressingly&#xD;
&#xD;
93&#xD;
&#xD;
about it-her arms, the long, loose sleeves faUleg&#xD;
below the elbows, were thrown up over her&#xD;
head, carrying half her ringlets with them. The&#xD;
face was glorious with a beaming j y; the eye-&#xD;
brows raised, arched and open; the lips full and&#xD;
slightly apart with a dreamy smile; the cheeks&#xD;
faintly colored; the whole complexion of face,&#xD;
arms and bosom, roseate; the muscles all full,&#xD;
elastic, slightly inflated, as by rising joy or life;&#xD;
a very gentle per~piration and regular breathing&#xD;
assured the mother that this was really health-&#xD;
ful sleep and happy dreaming. Inspired with&#xD;
hope, the mother dropped upon her knees and&#xD;
thanked God, saying,&#xD;
"This girl may be an erring maniac, but she&#xD;
is not guilty! Thank Gad! The guilty never&#xD;
sleep, never dream like that! If it were so,&#xD;
then indeed would the wandering fancies of poox&#xD;
Winny have struck upon some truth I"&#xD;
She knelt, and watched her long-receiving&#xD;
from the radiant sleeping face a balm for all the&#xD;
wounds the haggard face had given her. Oh!&#xD;
long she knelt by the side of the beautiful&#xD;
sleeper, loath to leave her-loath, for fear that&#xD;
the lost vision would never return to bless her&#xD;
sight, and soothe her fears again. At last sh~&#xD;
left the chamber and returned to bed, to lie&#xD;
there and wonder at the strange occurrence.&#xD;
S~e thought of all that she had read of trances,&#xD;
ecstacies, on which, when the body seemed to&#xD;
sleep, the soul was absent-but all she remem-&#xD;
bered of such cases, only convinced her that this&#xD;
sleep of Imogene's was neither trance nor ec-&#xD;
stacy-the soul was not absent from that glori-&#xD;
fied body! no !-it was very present-present in&#xD;
its most exalted lif~e-makmng radiant the coun-&#xD;
tenance of the beautiful sleeper-no-this was a&#xD;
healthful sleep, and a heavenly dream-but&#xD;
what, then, was the remorse, that consuming&#xD;
Imogene all day long, was lifted frhm her soul&#xD;
at night?&#xD;
The lady was an early riser-she was up&#xD;
with the sun. She saw nothing of Imogene un-&#xD;
til they were all assembled at breakfast, when&#xD;
her daughter catered-pale, still, cold, impassi-&#xD;
ble as usual, and took her seat at the table, as&#xD;
unlike the radiant and celestial dreamer of the&#xD;
night before as she was to the tortured, half-&#xD;
frenzied sufferer of the day before&#xD;
"Have you seen Winny this morning, Miss&#xD;
Summerfield ?" inquired her uncle.&#xD;
"Yes, sir,-I have just left her room. She&#xD;
has not yet risen-"&#xD;
"How is she then, my dear ?"&#xD;
"As usual."&#xD;
"And who is with her?"&#xD;
"Our grandmother. She has the adjoining&#xD;
room to Winny. She stays with her always."&#xD;
"She was not there when I went in yester~&#xD;
day, and, by-the-way, I have not seen her mo-&#xD;
ther-how is she?"&#xD;
"She is improving in health-she le quiet and&#xD;

CHAPTER XXX. -&#xD;
CLA UDE VELLEMONTE.&#xD;
"Sublime significance of mouth,&#xD;
Dilated nostril full of youth,&#xD;
And forehead royal with the truth,&#xD;
With sovran eyes of depth profound-&#xD;
And yet,&#xD;
The power of life was in them set."&#xD;
liTre. Browning.&#xD;
The day of the dinner party came. The hand-&#xD;
somely furnished drawing-room was decorated&#xD;
and thrown open, and according to the cere.&#xD;
monious custom of the day and neighborhood,&#xD;
Mt-s and Miss Summ'~rfield, supported by Squire&#xD;
Darling, stood near the de~or to receive their:&#xD;
&#xD;
nests They were rather a handsome trio.&#xD;
Squire Darliig "neatly, trimly dresed-fresb&#xD;
as a bridegroom," in his suit of specklese black,&#xD;
which well became his fair complexion and fair&#xD;
blue eyes, cleared by recent illness, and his soft&#xD;
light hair. Squire Darling betrayed a conscious-&#xD;
ness of looking exceedingly well. Mrs. Sum.&#xD;
merfield was a lady of rare ma roniy beaty, as I&#xD;
have before hinted-her tall and fiusdy rounded&#xD;
form was arrayed in a full dinner co~turne ot rich&#xD;
black velvet and a small slight gossarrser cap set&#xD;
off without concealing the heavy bands of glossy&#xD;
black hair parted above her noble brow. Miss&#xD;
Summerfl0ld wore a crimson satin with full and&#xD;
open sleeves and open corsage, with chetnisette&#xD;
and under sleeves of tine lace in full and deep&#xD;
falls. Her long black ringlets flowing down as&#xD;
usual in their divisions were without any orna-&#xD;
ment beyond a single string of pearls around her&#xD;
classic head. Imogene seemed paler, thinner&#xD;
than ever. Nay by the contrast of her glowing&#xD;
dress and long black curls her face looked hag.&#xD;
gard, ghastly--but, alas I little did Miss Sum-&#xD;
merfield think or care about her looks. She&#xD;
leaned wearily upon her. uncle's arm and receiv-&#xD;
ed her guests with a politeness so evidently&#xD;
forced as to call forth remarks such as these&#xD;
when the latter had passed out of hearing.&#xD;
"What can be the matter with Miss Summer.&#xD;
field ?-and of all wonders ~vlere is Colonel Dan-&#xD;
gertield ?" and the simplest and dullest of their&#xD;
visitors would immediately combine these two&#xD;
circumstances.&#xD;
Nearly all the expected visitors had arrived,&#xD;
and Miss Summerfield nearly sinking with fa-&#xD;
tigue had just requested permission to leave her&#xD;
post when the name of "Mr. Vellemonte" was&#xD;
announced, and Squire Darling felt the form re-&#xD;
clining upon his arm start and quiver as If&#xD;
pierced by an arrow! and whispering hastily,&#xD;
"You are fatigued, Miss Summertield, and I&#xD;
must lead you to a seat" would have done so but&#xD;
that the gentleman announced immediately af-&#xD;
terwards entered the room and stood before&#xD;
them. Squire Darling bowed very lowly and&#xD;
gravely, and Mrs. Summerfield with more titan&#xD;
usual sauvity greeted her new visitor and took&#xD;
him off to a seat.&#xD;
"That is the new priest!"&#xD;
"That is Mr. Veliemonte, the new pastor of&#xD;
Sacred Heart."&#xD;
"Row remarkably handsome! how singularly&#xD;
graceful I"&#xD;
"How strangely like Miss Summerfield! Did&#xD;
you ever see such a likeness I" were the sup-&#xD;
pressed whispers of the company as Mr. Velle.&#xD;
monte crossed the room and tok a seat near a&#xD;
lady of his own congregation The subject of&#xD;
their comments was indeed singularly hand-&#xD;

ly developed vital tesn~,eiament. I fear he would&#xD;
not-interest the poetic reader, for with all ~is&#xD;

remarkable beauty, health was the great and&#xD;
striking peculiarity of his being. He was the&#xD;
ideal of physical, mental and moral HRALTH.&#xD;
The impersonation of a vigorous LIFE. Lir~&#xD;
was in every limb and feature-in every expres-&#xD;
sion, gesture and motion. Strange! but when&#xD;
you saw him you became conscious that every&#xD;
one else in comparison was more or less out ol&#xD;
health. He was tall and rather full.formed-his&#xD;
countenance was very fine-his forehead was&#xD;
high and broad-his face rather long, but his&#xD;
cheeks and chin so full and round as to give the&#xD;
whole face a beautiful oval cast-his complexion&#xD;
was clear and sanguine-his hair a warm auburn,&#xD;
and his eyes clear blue-his mouth perfectly&#xD;
beautiful in form and expression-yet with all&#xD;
this difference of form and complexion he was&#xD;
startlingly like dark and haggard Imogene. It&#xD;
~ was impossible to analyze this startling resem-&#xD;
blance, for when closely examined it was so in-&#xD;
tangible that it would disappear, and you would&#xD;
say it was a hallucination-there was none at all&#xD;
-until he would look at you or speak, and then&#xD;
the resemblance-say almost the identity would&#xD;
half terrify you. There sat the subject of this&#xD;
description cheerfully conversing with thelady on&#xD;
his right hand. From the time of his entrance&#xD;
a new spirit seemed infused into the hitherto for-&#xD;
mal and silent company. Conversation received&#xD;
an impulse, and pleasant talk and merry jest&#xD;
and happy smile went around-and around like&#xD;
a pleasant agitation-affecting all but Miss Sum-&#xD;
merfield, who, in a remote corner, sat alone and&#xD;
woody. Soon Vellemonte arose and mingled&#xD;
with the crowd, diffusing life and gaiety as he&#xD;
passed.&#xD;
"Dear me! I think he is very lively for a mi-&#xD;
nister of the gospel I" said a sour visaged lady&#xD;
in a hissing whisper, unconscious of being heard&#xD;
by the subject of her remark. Vellemonte turned&#xD;
quickly around and dropped his eyes, raining&#xD;
light and blessing and joy upon her, and then&#xD;
passed on. The lady's brow cleared as by magic,&#xD;
and warmed and exalted she, too, passed on her&#xD;
way rejoicing in light.&#xD;
Through the crowd he was seeking Harriette.&#xD;
He found her-and the merry maiden sprang&#xD;
joyously to meet him.&#xD;
"I want you to take me to Mrs. Ardenne's&#xD;
chamber," said he.&#xD;
And Harriet, with a "Certainly! please come&#xD;
this way I" led him out. She took him straight&#xD;
up to Winny's apartment. "Now do you wish&#xD;
me to go in ?"&#xD;
CC Yes," said he, with his hand on Harriette's&#xD;
short curls. "Yes, I wish you to come in."&#xD;
And they entered.&#xD;
Winny was in the same arm-chair-in the&#xD;
s~e still attitude. The old lady sat in the one&#xD;
~ite, smiling to the babe that lay in the crib&#xD;
b.M~ her. A brighter smile bloke like a burst&#xD;
of uI~bine over the old lady's face. as the young&#xD;

priest entered. Even Winny's cold face lighted&#xD;
up. He took the hands of each-and then sat&#xD;
down between them.                      5&#xD;
When he left them a half hour after, the face of&#xD;
the old lady was lighted with intelligence-and&#xD;
that of Winny, with emotion-at last. When&#xD;
he reached the drawing-room the people were all&#xD;
going in to dinner. He took the arm of Miss&#xD;
Summerfield, and drawing g it within his own con-&#xD;
ducted her to the table; and during the passage,&#xD;
while her arm reposed on his, her excited nerves&#xD;
grew calm, her heart quiet, her mind clear, as by&#xD;
a miracle. He sat by her side during dinner-.-&#xD;
watched her attentively, and waited on her&#xD;
zealously. When dinner was over, he again drew&#xD;
her arm within his own and took her back to the&#xD;
saloon to a distant fauteuil, and sat down beside&#xD;
her-his clear eyes turned with interest upon&#xD;
her haggard face, seeking to read there the seci~et&#xD;
of her misery. The other guests who had fol-&#xD;
lowed them into the saloon, dispersed themselves&#xD;
in gay parties over the room. None approached&#xD;
their fauteuil. He was still perusing her coun-&#xD;
tenance. Her eyes were dropped-yet here was&#xD;
no disturbance, no paleness, no trembling, no&#xD;
shrinking from that clear and searching gaze.&#xD;
All was calmness. At last he spoke, and his&#xD;
round full liquid notes were melody.&#xD;
"Imogene, we meet at last-meet for the se-&#xD;
cond time for three years; and I find you, oh&#xD;
so frightfully altered! Imogene, I knew nothing&#xD;
of this. I knew you had never entered the chapel&#xD;
since my arrival, but I conjectured that devotion&#xD;
to your cousin prevented you. I did not guess that&#xD;
you had been ill! Have you been ill, Imogene?"&#xD;
"In body? no," replied Miss Summerfield,&#xD;
without lifting her eyelashes.&#xD;
"Then you have mentally -suffered, Imogene I&#xD;
it is even as I feared. Tell me the cause of your&#xD;
trouble, Imogene. Ha I do you shudder so! and&#xD;
grow pallid, and drop your face upon your hands!&#xD;
Nay, nay-look up, imogene, raise your eyes to&#xD;
mine I I would soothe, not agitate you; look at&#xD;
me, Imogene ?"&#xD;
Was there mesmerism or magic in those soft&#xD;
full tones-full of compassion as command? Miss&#xD;
Summerfield, with the involuntary docility of a&#xD;
child, slowly raised her eyes, and slowly let them&#xD;
meet his own-his clear deep eyes, whence light&#xD;
and life, blessing and joy, streamed into hers;&#xD;
filling her heart with peace-raising her soul to&#xD;
a new sense of life. It was as though that glance&#xD;
had rent apart the curdling blood that now flowed&#xD;
healthfully through all her veins-flushing her&#xD;
cheeks, lighting her eyes, and elevating her&#xD;
spirits.&#xD;
He was a shade paler, a degree sadder, as he&#xD;
said, -&#xD;
"I will not ask you for your secret again,&#xD;
Imogene. Souse day you seill tell s7 sue. But I&#xD;
will ask you to come to church. Promise tue&#xD;
that."&#xD;

"Yes, I promise it-the more readily that I&#xD;
have passed my word to my mother to do so."&#xD;
"That is well Imoge~e, look in my eyes and&#xD;
reid my soul deeply as your glance can pierce-&#xD;
and for anything that lies deeper than that, ask&#xD;
me and I will tell you."&#xD;
"Why do you say this to me ?"&#xD;
"Because I read in your countenance, among&#xD;
other things, a wonder, an interest, and a cu-&#xD;

"Nothing more&#xD;
"Yes! something more! Bhall Itell you what&#xD;

"No !" exclaimed Imogene, shuddering vio-&#xD;
lently, struck with a sudden convulsion.&#xD;
The hand of the priest fell slowly and lightly&#xD;
on hers, and her agitation subsided. "Now,&#xD;
Imogene, you might, if you so pleased, tell me&#xD;
the darkest secret of your heart, and it would&#xD;
grow bright in the communication; or, you&#xD;
may ask me for mine-you may sift me tho-&#xD;
roughly."&#xD;
C~ Tell me, then," said Miss Summerfield,&#xD;

"My power? Imogene, the evening is plea-&#xD;
sant, though cool; will you come on the lawn ?"&#xD;
And without waiting her reply, he cheerfully&#xD;
arose, took her hand and drew her through the&#xD;
glass doors, and down the marble steps to the&#xD;
lawn. "Now, my power-which power, Imo-&#xD;
gene. I have severaL"&#xD;
C' Listen, then! Three years ago, before SI had&#xD;
ever seen you, I was attacked with typhus fever.&#xD;
I was in extremity, and a priest was summoned&#xD;
to annoint my hands and feet for burial. You&#xD;
came. I was speechless, sinking-you gave me&#xD;
extreme unction-your touch struck all the&#xD;
electric cords of life; you prayed by me-and&#xD;
your voice called back the departing spirit-I&#xD;
lived! I knew my life giver! Explain that."&#xD;
"Imogene! I earnestly desired your recovery.&#xD;
I prayed for it-believed in it; and sought with&#xD;
my strong electric life to galvanize yours into s&#xD;
new vigor; that is all."&#xD;
'~ Again! we met around the death..bed of an&#xD;
old, a very old lady. We believed her dying of&#xD;

"There is something more in this than you&#xD;

entered, and the gloom was dispersed; the for.&#xD;

"Yes! yes! but how does that will act upon&#xD;

CC You are scarcely prepared for that know-&#xD;

eyes with their dazzling rays of light, full upon&#xD;
hers and said-" shall I tell thee, Imogene ?"&#xD;
"No," exclaimed Miss Summerfield, with&#xD;
sudden energy.&#xD;
And again that hand sank slowly, lightly,&#xD;
softly upon hers-and again the delirium of her&#xD;
nerves subsided, and she grew serene and be-&#xD;
came cheerful. Rising, he left her side now and&#xD;
went through the room, like a sun-ray spreading&#xD;
light and cheerfulness. Many of the visitors&#xD;

trol of the lady subdued the agitation of her commenced in a low, monotonous tone, like one&#xD;
&#xD;
nerves, and she arose and struck a light. Her&#xD;
first thought was her daughter. With an un-&#xD;
accountable presentiment and a vague terror, she&#xD;
passed into Miss Summerfield's room. She went&#xD;
up to her bed-started! suppressed a shriek at&#xD;
the appalling sight that met her eyes. Deathly&#xD;
pale, frightfully distorted, violently convulsed,&#xD;
yet sleeping still-wa. that form. Oh, the&#xD;
agony! oh, the anguish written on that written&#xD;
brow of the sleeper I Down and out went the&#xD;
candle, with her delirium of alarm.&#xD;
"Imogene! Imogene! awake! awake!" she&#xD;
exclaimed, raising the girl in her arms. Miss&#xD;
Summerfield slowly opened her eyes-slowly,&#xD;
~re slowly than ever before, Earns back the&#xD;
light of her soul to them. "Imogene! my child,&#xD;
my child-what is all this ?"&#xD;
Miss Summerfield was now calmly looking on&#xD;
her mother's face. She arose, and giving her&#xD;
hand to that mother, said-" And are yotw&#xD;
nights, as well as your days, disturbed by care~&#xD;
for me, my dear mother? Come, I will tell thee&#xD;
my ~atk secret-thou shalt guide me. Come,&#xD;
mother! let us go into your chamber-here it&#xD;
ispnrgatory-.your room is a psiosful and holy&#xD;
heaven."&#xD;
&#xD;
indeed talking in sleep and fearful of waking.&#xD;
C' It is three years-nearly four, mother; since&#xD;
I went from home to school, is it not? Well,&#xD;
mother; I was joyous then, was I not? Life&#xD;
seemed--yes, life was, very brilliant, very daz-&#xD;
zling to me! I was filled with enthusiasm and&#xD;
joy! Perhaps the highest joy I felt then, mo.&#xD;
ther, was in the ardent admiration of my-.-oi&#xD;
my-of Colonel Dangerfield, Wherever I might&#xD;
be, I seemed alike to walk in the light ef a glori.&#xD;
ous vision; and the most glorious feature, the&#xD;
god of that vision wa~ Colonel Dangerfield.&#xD;
Yes, mother, whether when I was packed intr&#xD;
a close stage.coach on my journey to school, oi&#xD;
in the crowded first-class room, or in the recrea&#xD;
tion grounds, or the chapel, or the dormitory-&#xD;
wherever my body, or even my intellect might&#xD;
be, my spirit was roaming through palace, halls,&#xD;
grounds, with Dangerfie)d. The ring he p!aee'i&#xD;
upon my finger at parting, the miniature that&#xD;
he hux(g upon my bosom seemed to me holy as&#xD;
the holiest saint's relict. They were my t.jis..&#xD;
mans; I would clasp them in prayer; 1 *~lk.4&#xD;
apart as in a golden dream, Everything mi*&#xD;
item-ed to this one idea-. Dangerfield. In all my~&#xD;
occupations, amusements and studies, this was&#xD;
&#xD;
tor, she hoped that this might continue. More&#xD;
than ever of late, she had been possessed of the&#xD;
idea that her daughter's melancholy arose rather&#xD;
from a distempered mind, than from any exter-&#xD;
nal and tangible cause. She had been crowing&#xD;
to believe Imogine the subject and victim of a&#xD;
monomania. This she now hoped would yield to&#xD;
the spiritual influences of religion. And as 'the&#xD;
evening wore away, and she saw Imogene emerg-&#xD;
ing more and more from her moody abstraction,&#xD;
beaming into bright and brighter life; once more&#xD;

100&#xD;
&#xD;
the Alpha and Omega.- '-the beginning and the&#xD;
end. Yea, this was the '~enrre around which my&#xD;
whole life revolved. Did [read bistor~r? I saw&#xD;
nothing there so prominent as the noble Roman&#xD;
matrons, the noble wives of history, and said iii&#xD;
my profoundest heart. even such a wife will I&#xD;
be to my noble American I Did I weary in any&#xD;
task? I looked upon my ring, upon his miniature,&#xD;
and said, for thy sake, for thy heroic sake, I will&#xD;
conquer repugnance, I will caster this ta~k; and&#xD;
then my heart would fire WiLh enthusiasm, and&#xD;
the toil itself would ca4 a reflex pleasure, ex-&#xD;
quisite as profound 1 lid i.ot mingle with my&#xD;
school fellows. All deep joy shuns levity as&#xD;
sorrow does-yes, more nan sorrow does. Sor-&#xD;
row may seek to disguise or distract itself in&#xD;
levity, but earnest joy is always serious. So I&#xD;
walked apart in a golden dream My compa-&#xD;
nions called me haughty; my teachers charged&#xD;
me with absence of mind; and they were right.&#xD;
No nun among my teachers hired such an 'inner&#xD;
life' as I did. My life was 'hidden' mdccl&#xD;
with-not with a 'heavenly,' but an earthly&#xD;
'bridegroom.' Yes I I was indeed 'Glory's&#xD;
Bride'--in issag~i nation.&#xD;
"Dangerfield was my enthusiasm, my wdrsaip,&#xD;
my secret treasure, and I would be glad when&#xD;
my head was on the pillow, and the real world&#xD;
was dark and silent, was gone from me, and vista&#xD;
after vista of the ideal '.orld, each more glorious&#xD;
than the other, would open before me 'in the&#xD;
bright pageant of a midnight dream.' The great&#xD;
cities of the earth, the kingdoms of the world,&#xD;
and the powers thereof, passed in rapid and daz-&#xD;
zling succession-a magnificent panorama before&#xD;
my mind's eye-and first and last, and most&#xD;
glorious there, lighting up my dream as the sun&#xD;
lights up day, radiated-IhisGEarIEw. Oh! can&#xD;
1 make you see how splendid beyond one's bright-&#xD;
est conceptions of heaven these all-glorious&#xD;
visions were ?"&#xD;
"You loved him, Imogene j Oh, Imogene; you&#xD;
loved him so mitch! You might have been happy&#xD;
as prosperous! Alas, what followed? I wait&#xD;
to hear."&#xD;
A profound sigh, followed by a deep silence,&#xD;
answered her. At last.&#xD;
"Do you recollect, mother, that I was scarce-&#xD;
ly' fifteen years old then, and by no means pre-&#xD;
cocious 7"&#xD;
"Yes, yes; I remember-but go on-or rather&#xD;
I mean-take your time, my dear child."&#xD;
"Mother, I loved him not. I never loved him,&#xD;
never could, never can love him I"&#xD;
"IMOGENE I are you then indeed mad? You&#xD;
give me the history of the most rapt and passion-&#xD;
ate devotion, and end by saying that you did&#xD;
not, could not, can not love the man I"&#xD;
"Mother, was it thus you loved my father 7"&#xD;
"No, not with such enthusiasm; he was a&#xD;
most worthy man, and I loved him truly, sober-&#xD;
&#xD;
ly, and faithfully; for I was awidowat eighteen,&#xD;
and never re-married."&#xD;
A long pause followed this, and then Imogene&#xD;
resumed the conversat;on&#xD;
"No, mother, not so; you loved my father;&#xD;
for you loved, and .[ did not-my passion, for it&#xD;
was a passion, if one ever fire; a numan soul.--&#xD;
was of the imagination only-it was the fever,&#xD;
the enthusiasm, the very ecstacy of HERO -won-&#xD;
surv !-nor more, nor less."&#xD;
"Oh, Imogene! there is something behind&#xD;
yet&#xD;
~~There is, and yet- Well! you know, mo-&#xD;
ther; or perhaps you do not know, that the holy&#xD;
and secluded sisterhood are most voracious&#xD;
after news of the outside and unholy world! Of&#xD;
all the dwellers upon earth, they are the most in-&#xD;
veterate gossips! '17 hey gossip wito the elder&#xD;
girls, for from them after their return from visits&#xD;
out, they get the newest newsy and to them&#xD;
they impart any morsel of interest that they, in&#xD;
the seclusion of their retreat, may have picked&#xD;
up from a casual visitor. Thence it fell out that&#xD;
from the sisters, at last, the elder girls found out&#xD;
the secret of my betrothal; and then one by one,&#xD;
and little by little, they sought to edge into my&#xD;
confidence. One young lady would inform me&#xD;
that her father had been chairman at the great&#xD;
dinner given to Colonel Dangerfield at Rifu-&#xD;
mond; and saying that she believed he was of&#xD;
my neighborhood, would ask me if I were per-&#xD;
sonally acquainted with him. Another would&#xD;
tell me that her eldest sister had been on&#xD;
the committee of ladies appointed to present Co-&#xD;
lonel Dangerfield with a sword from the la-&#xD;
dies of Winchester. I always acknowledged the&#xD;
acquaintance, but did not encourage farther&#xD;
questioning; however much the glow that&#xD;
would kindle on my cheek might betray me.&#xD;
Sometimes I Would come suddenly into the re-&#xD;
creation room and find a group of girls discussing&#xD;
him and me! 'heiress of an immense fortune,'&#xD;
'yes! already engaged;' 'yes, indeed! I guess&#xD;
he is! my father says he will be Secretary of&#xD;
War next term ;~ 'I heard my Uncle Peter say,&#xD;
that he would run for Governor at the next elec-&#xD;
tion,' &amp;amp;c., &amp;amp;c. Alas! mother, I suppose you&#xD;
think I tell you all these petty details to stave off&#xD;
as long as possible-the truth"&#xD;
"Nay, courage, my Imogene; 1 have grown&#xD;
very calm; tell me now calmly what next 1,'&#xD;
"I will tell you. I too am quiet now. I&#xD;
dreaded the telling of this story, or the com-&#xD;
mencement of it, as one dreads the first incision&#xD;
of the lancet; but now the pierce is past, the&#xD;
vein Is opened, and the blood flows freely I"&#xD;
"My child, talk plainly, quietly; do not law&#xD;
dulge in such ghastly ractaphors."&#xD;
"I will not. 1 will go on soberly; for now&#xD;
methinks it is more like a dream than ever.&#xD;

Chaplain and Father Confessor died; a success.&#xD;
was appointed temporarily to fill his place. Thu&#xD;
happened before I was taken ill, yet the success&#xD;
sor had not arrived yet. Mother, more thai&#xD;
ever in the delirium of fever, was my mind ab&#xD;
sent from my body-not in a world of joy an&#xD;
glory as before, but in one every way the re&#xD;
verse. Visions of fire and smoke-vast sheets&#xD;
of flame scorched and suffocated me; visions 0:&#xD;
blood sickened me with disgust and horror; al&#xD;
one moment I was wrapt in the flames of a burn&#xD;
ing city, and at another sinking in a sea of gore.&#xD;
All the horrors of all the wars I ha'; ever read&#xD;
of in history were re produced and re-enacted&#xD;
around me. All the fields of carnage-all the&#xD;
sacked cities and murdered children-all--all the&#xD;
horror without the glory! And through all wat&#xD;
that intolerable feeling of burning fire! and that&#xD;
insufferable, loathsome, suffocating smell of fresh&#xD;
blood! Oh! it was horrible! horrible! horrible!&#xD;
and more horrible than all, by a grotesque phan-&#xD;
tasy, as the presiding Demon of this hellish storm,&#xD;
moved hither and thither through smoke and&#xD;
flame and blood, the hideous, the blackened and&#xD;
deformed caricature of - Danger/leld! Me.&#xD;

and blackened walls still shivering around me;&#xD;
dead bodies in fragments lying about; gray haired&#xD;
women; little boys and young girls; Innocent&#xD;
victims! and worse than all, oh! pitying angels,&#xD;
a babe, the sole survivor of the family-a young&#xD;
babe lay under a table with both its legs crushed&#xD;
ofl."&#xD;
"Hush! hush! Imogene! those ghastly visions&#xD;
of your delirium! It was owing to the high fever&#xD;
-the blood in your bead!"&#xD;
"Sometimes my visions would escape from the&#xD;
poignant anguish of individual and detailed saif-&#xD;
fering, and lose themselves in a dilating horror,&#xD;
less painful because bewildering. It seemed that&#xD;
my demon-warrior and bridegroom had built me&#xD;
a throne of the bleeding bodies."&#xD;
"Hush, hush, imogene, you excite yourself,&#xD;
and terrify me-go on quietly, my dear-what&#xD;
next 7"&#xD;
"Mother, this-gradually, very gradually, the&#xD;
fire burned low; the fever cooled; the vision of&#xD;
flame and blood departed, leaving me only the&#xD;
haunting memory; then my soul fluttered-&#xD;
floated-wavered towards the light of conscious-&#xD;
ness and reason; still it was not a recovery, or&#xD;
an atvakening, it was more like a healthful tran-&#xD;
sition in a dream I became quiet, cool, moist,&#xD;
half-conscious of a cool and vapory perspiration,&#xD;
a~d a pleasant 'lumber. A cool, delicious touch,&#xD;
like a snow-flake on my brow, at last awoke&#xD;
* Fact Letter from Mexico.&#xD;

&#xD;
I me. I opened my eyes and looked up-livin%,&#xD;
r sane, restored, happy-looked up to meet a, pair&#xD;
of eyes brooding over mine-eyes so clea~ and&#xD;
- pure in their beautiful depths, tbat it seemed 1&#xD;
could look deep down a boundless heaven within.&#xD;
- Those eyes !-L saw-I felt only those eyes-&#xD;
I they were another visioii to me-a vision of&#xD;
- new life-of love-of joy-streams of light pour-&#xD;
ed from their orbs into mine, illuminating,&#xD;
f strengthening all my being. They talked to me&#xD;
so much in that instant of time. They said-&#xD;
* 'Awake! arise! put on thy strength, for thy&#xD;
Redeemer cometh' They said...A Even as now&#xD;
I has passed away that horrid dream of flame and&#xD;
I blood, so will at last pass away all the crime&#xD;
and anguish of earth! &amp;amp;nd as now thou aast&#xD;
awakened cool and happy-so, at death, shalt&#xD;
thou awake from the fever dream of time to the&#xD;
life of heaven, and to the eternity ot good.' Then&#xD;
the eyes set, as the stars go down, or else my&#xD;
eyes closed on them to open on another a;id a&#xD;
celestial dream. I heard a silvery rustle of&#xD;
pleasant voices-and saw a white-winged troop&#xD;
of angels-.and lighting up the radiant browbf&#xD;
one were the beautiful, clear eyes of my guar-&#xD;
dian spirit. Methought they hovered around&#xD;
a death-bed, waiting trie birth of the angel-and&#xD;
as they talked, it seemeui to me that thi- deatk&#xD;
was the second birth spoken of in the ~criprures&#xD;
-that as the body is born into the mate-&#xD;
rial world in the first birth, so the soul is&#xD;
born into the spiritual world at death-the se-&#xD;
cond birth-that the body must be delivered of&#xD;
the soul before the soul can inherit the kingdom&#xD;
of heaven! I realized then how death was the&#xD;
entrance into a vastly higher life.. ifother I it is&#xD;
one thing to hear this said over and over again,&#xD;
until the words have no meaning, and another&#xD;
thing to realize it as a truth-as the new reve-&#xD;
lation of a truth I"&#xD;
Imogene paused, and then resumed-" So I&#xD;
floated about in the atmosphere of that silvery&#xD;
dream-bright, radiant, dazzling as a mist of&#xD;
liquid diamonds-and still the sun of that celes-&#xD;
tial union was the clear eyed angel-showering&#xD;
rays of light as he moved. Such were the bliss-&#xD;
ful visions of my reviving life."&#xD;
Imogene stopped acain. Day was dawning&#xD;
now. The early sounds of awakening life .jegan&#xD;

symnarhy, the good sisters suspected that my&#xD;
malady was rather mental than corporeal, and&#xD;
so they tried to ease and cheer me; and lastly,&#xD;
mother, as the very climax of my trial, they&#xD;
sent- Claude Vellemonte himself to talk to me- 1&#xD;
made an excuse, and declined to receive him.&#xD;
Ttien, mother, I wrote to you, expressing a wish&#xD;
to return home-you came and brought me here.&#xD;
I tried to baneh ever v thought, every memory&#xD;
or Claude. I prayed, fasted, tried to lose my-&#xD;
self in study; tried to uproot one image in my&#xD;
heart, and plent another there! in vain, mo-&#xD;
ther! I tried to look on Colonel Dangerfield as&#xD;
I had looked b4ore--to love and venerate him-&#xD;
to beimev~d owed to him my very being Oii, worse&#xD;
than vain. See, mother, what remorse has con-&#xD;
surned my heart, for treachery to my betrothed&#xD;
huibdaul for my impious, my sacrilegious love&#xD;
for an anointed priest of God! And when, after&#xD;
months had passed--months of criminal love and&#xD;
consuming remorse, and I had nearly withered&#xD;
to the ruin I am now, we met again, suddenly,&#xD;
unexpectedly, at the bedside of my grandmother.&#xD;
When I met his eye-when he touched my hand&#xD;
-it was like a lightning stroke! The blood&#xD;
atagiiated in my heart-I reeled-and for a mo-&#xD;
ment, lost myself." She paused, and then re-&#xD;
sumed, very gently, in a lower, quieter key, and&#xD;
in a thin and silvery clear tone-" My mother,&#xD;
do you think' I have been mad? Yes! since I&#xD;
left tue convent-since my return home, I have&#xD;
been mad at times-sometimes frenzied with&#xD;
such a poignant sense of guilt, that I have&#xD;
thought in this sacrilegious love, I had commit-&#xD;
ted the unpardonable sin-the sin against the&#xD;
Holy Ghost-and then, indeed, I was often near&#xD;
betraying myself by breaking out into actual&#xD;
raving madness! Oh, often when you and others&#xD;
thought me so cold, so quiet, my superficial&#xD;
composure covered ~n internal storm, that threat-&#xD;
ened each instant to break out in open iladness;&#xD;
therefore, mother, when you touched the subject&#xD;
of my secret anguish-therefore I had to escape,&#xD;
for my more than life, my sanity! for I was in&#xD;
momentary dread and danger of losing the slight&#xD;
but perfect self-control I exhibited. There was&#xD;
but a ptper wall between me and raving madness!&#xD;
And I knew if this was once burst through, all&#xD;
was over with me! I knew if I should lose my&#xD;
self.command I 'should also forfeit my self-re-&#xD;
spect, and the respect of others! And with all&#xD;
my guilt and remorse, I was haughty still!&#xD;
Mother, 1 dreaded to meet him more than 'death&#xD;
and perdition! 1 absented myself from church,&#xD;
and when he came to the house, I kept out of&#xD;
sight. I did not expect him here at the dinner&#xD;
party; he came, and therefore I was taken by&#xD;
surprise! But, mother, now the mystery again,&#xD;
for after the first shock of my nerves had passed,&#xD;
his glance, voice and touch had a magnetic pow-&#xD;
er of tranquilizing and strengthening me-he&#xD;
&#xD;
103&#xD;
&#xD;
affected me now as he had in the first hours of&#xD;
my recovery from death-sickness. Mother, 1&#xD;
know not the spiritual mystery of what I next&#xD;
experienced, but it was this-I read God's mer-&#xD;
cy in his eyes-heard God's blessing in his&#xD;
voice-felt God's love in his touch- You saw&#xD;
how cheerful I was, mother. I retired to rest,&#xD;
arA then came a re-action, a demon-dream, from&#xD;
which you awoke me. Verily, 'we war not&#xD;
with flesh and blood, but with powers and prin-&#xD;
cipalities of darkness.' But, mother, that whole-&#xD;
some influence of yesterday evening has given&#xD;
me strength at last to confide in you, and I feel&#xD;
better for it-speak to me, dear mother."&#xD;
Mrs. Summerfield sat silent for a long time&#xD;
-with her hanos clasped together upon her&#xD;
knees-with her eyes strained upon her handa,&#xD;
and a look of unutterable anguish on her brow.&#xD;
She was appalled by what she, like Imogene,&#xD;
looked upon as a sin of the deepest die, for which&#xD;
earth scarcely contained a parallel or heaven a&#xD;
pardon.&#xD;
"Speak to me, dearest mother! Tell me now&#xD;
what I am to do and I will do it."&#xD;
"Oh! lost, lost girl! You say that you were&#xD;
not mad until after your return home! Alas!&#xD;
you have been mad from first to last! possessed&#xD;
of a devil one might almost think 1"&#xD;
"Patience, dearest mother! look on my poor&#xD;
worn face bind you will have patience."&#xD;
"Oh I Imogene, Imogene, this is the bitterness&#xD;
of woe 1"&#xD;
"Look at me, dearest mother."&#xD;
"Oh, Imogene, my child, would that thou&#xD;
hadst died in thy cradle, in thy innocence I"&#xD;
"Oh, that I alone could suffer now, my mo-&#xD;
ther!"&#xD;
"Oh, imogene, would that I could suffer for&#xD;
thee! I alone! would that I could die, if that&#xD;
would cleanse thy soul from its black guilt!"&#xD;
"ONE has done that for me, mother! calm&#xD;
yourself, mother-tell me, what shall I do?"&#xD;
"Oh, Imogene, the tender arms of the holy&#xD;
mother church are ever stretched out in mercy,&#xD;
in supplication to her erring, her sinning, and&#xD;
suffering children! Your brilliant worldly pro-&#xD;
spects have vanished in darkness, Imogene! and&#xD;
with them all my earthly hopes of happiness!&#xD;
No matter for your lost splendid prospects,&#xD;
or my lost happiness, they weigh lighter than&#xD;
a feather against the heavy weight of this&#xD;
'enormous guilt! Repent-confess-expiate! un-&#xD;

Sina Hinton had outwitted herself if ever an&#xD;
intriguante did; she had done too much and too&#xD;
well; she was cursed with too much success.&#xD;
Wishing to banish the daughter completely from&#xD;
her father's heart and home, she had exiled Ar-&#xD;
deiine, broken the heart of Winny, and so opened&#xD;
the bosom of Squire Darling for the reception of&#xD;
his suffering child: that was failure the first.&#xD;
Then having wished to supplant that banished&#xD;
chili in the home, heart, and fortune of her fa-&#xD;
ther, sne had played her part so well, that instead&#xD;
of adoping her as his daughter, the fat and rosy&#xD;
old squre must needs fall desperately in love&#xD;
with her and woo her as his wife 1--lastly having&#xD;
essayed through the morbid conscience and guilty&#xD;
fears of the priest to obtain a perfect command of&#xD;
him, and through him of his most powerful pa-&#xD;
rishioiiors, she had overdone the thing so com-&#xD;
pletely as to terrify the poor old man into dota~e&#xD;
and imbecility-thereby rendering him unfit for]&#xD;
her use.&#xD;

from a habit of childhood and youtn, not to be&#xD;
broken now, was always punctual in his atten-&#xD;
dance on divine service. His pew was quite on&#xD;
the opposite side of the building to that of the&#xD;
Summerfield family, but it was side by side with&#xD;
Squire Darling's pew, of which, since the mar-&#xD;
riage of Winny, the infirmity of the old lady,&#xD;
and the illness of the squire himself, Miss Hin-&#xD;
ton was the sole occupant. Now as Colonel&#xD;
Dangerfield would sit in that pew so cold and&#xD;
stern, he would some times catcfs a pair of large,&#xD;
dark, tender eyes fixed in mournful sympathy&#xD;
upon him, which would drop their long lashes&#xD;
upon a crimsoning cheek quick as detected.&#xD;
Such beautiful eyes! they were veiled from his&#xD;
sight only to haunt his merry. Hush I-he&#xD;
would not whisper to his own heart-lie would&#xD;
not listen if his heart whispered it to him-that&#xD;
there was anything but accident in what made&#xD;
that corner of the pew where he could lean at&#xD;
ease and see, without looking at, those shadowy&#xD;
eyes-so comfortahie. Nonsense! there was no-&#xD;
thing in it! that corner fitted his back, and the&#xD;
other 'the opposite corner was some how-le/X&#xD;
handed-i know not to what, unless it was to&#xD;
S~na Ilinton's soft dark eyes! But sometimes&#xD;
when the Summerfield pew on the other side&#xD;
of the church happened to be empty, Miss&#xD;
Hir.ton would prefer to sit there; and some how&#xD;
or other he would find his old position uncom-&#xD;

getting Virginian chivalry, honor, gallantry,&#xD;
hospitality, he suddenly caught. the girl to his&#xD;
bosom nearly crusriing all ner little bones in&#xD;
his bear like hug, and naif suffocating her with&#xD;
kisses-exclaiming between them-&#xD;

native. 1 must m.'trry you, my little girl, but&#xD;
that will be the very first and last arbitrary act&#xD;
I ever did or ever will show you. Oh, Sina, I&#xD;
will be so good to you if you will only be my&#xD;
dear little wife. Child! I will love and cherish&#xD;
you mote tenderly than man ever did woman&#xD;
before. Su-h a good husband as I will be to you,&#xD;
Sinai Your every wish shall be a law to me&#xD;
and mine!"&#xD;
All this time Sina was lying in his arms, her&#xD;
head upon his shoulder, sobbing as if her heart&#xD;
would rreak, while he continued speaking softly,&#xD;
"Child, haven't you heard the old ladies say&#xD;
'It is better to be an old man's darling than a&#xD;
young man's slave?' I know my rival, Sina! It&#xD;
is Dangerlieli (curse him). Little girl, will A.&#xD;
lov~ you as I shall? I am not only faithful, 1&#xD;
am faitk. And he a young, gay, handsome, ce-&#xD;
lebra ad officer of rank in the army. Sina, he'll&#xD;
never he true to you You'll have half-a-dozen&#xD;
unworthy rivals No! he'll never love you as I&#xD;
do-never? and it is more necessary to a wo-&#xD;
man's happiness tbat she be loved than that she&#xD;
loves Come, Sinai forgive my roughness! I&#xD;
loved you so dearly. %iiod help me! it was an&#xD;
irresistible temptation !-the Virgin pardon me!&#xD;
-to have you sitting there with your hands&#xD;
folded, and your face sparkling between your&#xD;
black ringlets turned up to mine! forgive me,&#xD;
Sina! with all my rudeness and all your beauty,&#xD;
nothing would have tempted me to treat any&#xD;
woman so, whom I did not intend to marry in&#xD;
spite of all heaven, earth, and hell !"&#xD;
" Oa!'my dear benefactor, forgive me," said&#xD;
the wily girl, "for I have been violent too-but&#xD;
you do not know how dear a-never mind! You&#xD;
-you will kindly give me a few days to think~&#xD;
Dangerfield, your rival! My dear benefactor,&#xD;
how easily these mysteries are unravelled when&#xD;
one has the key to them. Think now of Colonel&#xD;
Dangerfield seeking me to induce me to use my&#xD;
influence with Miss Summerfield in his behalf-&#xD;
for Miss Summerfield has discarded him, while&#xD;
he is still passionately attached to her !"&#xD;
"Dis-! what/tim"'&#xD;
"Yes! but this is almost a breach of confi-&#xD;
dence, which neither the Colonel nor the Sum-&#xD;
meflelds might like. I tell you this to tranquil-&#xD;
lize you, that is my only excuse: Pra3f do not&#xD;
mention it to any of the family unless they first&#xD;
name it to you !"&#xD;
"Dis-! Well! Now, Sina, say! Oh, Sina,&#xD;
say? You'll be my dear little wife, won't you?&#xD;
Don't keep me on the tenter hooks of suspense&#xD;
any longer. Don't torture me again! Come!&#xD;
speak; you seill, won't you ?"&#xD;
"My dear protector, please give me two days&#xD;
to think of it; will you ?"&#xD;
"Well, well! if I must, I must, without any&#xD;
sort of doubt. Here they are with tea."&#xD;
&#xD;
I'? DALE.&#xD;
And at that moment Nerve and Kill entered&#xD;
with two waiters, to arrange the table As soon&#xD;
as tea was over, Miss Hinton excused herself,&#xD;
and retired; while Squire Darling communed&#xD;
with himself to the following effect. "What&#xD;
Sina says, may be all very true; and in the main&#xD;
I believe it is; but then again, I do not like the&#xD;
fellow poking about here so often; and if Into&#xD;
gene has really discarded him-what ever could&#xD;
possess the girl to do it? why next thing he'll&#xD;
be for consoling himself with some other wo-&#xD;
man. And what woman so likely as Sjna?&#xD;
Finally! confound him! lowe the man nothing!&#xD;
1 am under no obligation to receive the man&#xD;
here! my house is my castle-and-hospitality&#xD;
be sunk where the sacredness of hearth is con-&#xD;
cerned! Ergot P11 forbid the fellow the house!&#xD;
and if he wants to know the reason, I'll tell&#xD;
him!" And the next day proved the squire&#xD;
quite as rude as his word.&#xD;
Miss Hinton was sitting at an upper front&#xD;
window the next morning, when Colonel Dan.&#xD;
gerfield rode up. He bowed low as the mane of&#xD;
his horse, in answer to her nod and smile of wel-&#xD;
come. When he alighted, she left the room and&#xD;
came to tbe head of the stairs, from whence she&#xD;
heard his brisk knock, saw a servant go to the&#xD;
door, heard his deep-toned voice enquirer . "Is&#xD;
Squire Darling at home ?" and the false answer,&#xD;
"No, sir." "Let Miss Hinton know then, that&#xD;
I am here," said the Colonel, preparing to enter.&#xD;
But the man held the door in his hand. and re-&#xD;
plied, in the face of the truth, "Miss Hinton is&#xD;
not at home, sir. She left here this morning&#xD;
with my master, to go to Red-Stone Hall 1" Miss&#xD;
Rinton's face kindled with indignation, and she&#xD;
made one bound with the intention of running&#xD;
down stairs to refute the falsehood, when she&#xD;
felt her waist clasped from behind, and the hard&#xD;
voice of Squire Darling saying,&#xD;
"No you don't, my darling! What you told&#xD;
me last night I believe to have been true-but&#xD;
then it related to the past, and perhaps the pre-&#xD;
sent, but gave no earnest for the future. 'Fore&#xD;
wit is better than after wit'-' A bird in the hand&#xD;
is worth two in the bush'-and-' It's foolish to&#xD;
'lock the stable-door after the steed is stolen.'&#xD;
Ergo, I practice 'fore wit;' I keep my 'bird in&#xD;
the hand,' and I secure my stablesdoors before&#xD;
'the steed is stolen;' so be easy, my little&#xD;
girl !"&#xD;
The fell girl's brow grew black as night, as&#xD;
she turned away from him to conceal her rage,&#xD;
and sought her chamber. Squire Darling staid&#xD;
home all day. That night, after the family had&#xD;
retired to rest, the dark girl stealthily left her&#xD;
chamber, (securing tl~e door on the outside,)&#xD;
passed silently down th~ stairs, out of an end&#xD;
door, entered the stables, saddled a horse, and&#xD;
rode swiftly from the house.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIII.&#xD;
'THE 5OLDIRfl'5 axST.'1&#xD;
- A palace beautiful to see;&#xD;
Marble perched, and cedar chambered,&#xD;
Thing with damask drapery:&#xD;
Bossed with o~nameuts of silver,&#xD;
Inierlaid with gems and gold&#xD;
Filled with carvings from Cathedrals&#xD;
Rescued in the days of old;&#xD;
Eloquent with bo~ks and pictures,&#xD;
all that luxury can afford;&#xD;
Warm with statues which Pygmalion&#xD;
Vi ght have fashioned and adored.&#xD;
In the forest glades and vistas&#xD;
Lovely are the light and gloom;&#xD;
Fountains sparkle in the gardens,&#xD;
And exotics breathe perfume.&#xD;
fctacka~,.&#xD;
Let me pick up some of the dropped stitches&#xD;
in this complex net. Colonel Dangerfield, im&#xD;
mediately aftt~r his last recorded interview with&#xD;
Miss Summerfield, had hurried home. The&#xD;
next morning he had written hasty notes of adieu&#xD;
to Mrs. and Miss Summerfield, and set out upon&#xD;
a longjourney. Ooly very recently he was sup-&#xD;
posed to have returned. He was now at "Th'&#xD;
Soldier's Rest," the modest name he had given&#xD;
to his magnificent winter residence near Win-&#xD;
chester Since his return he had not once ap-&#xD;
proached Red Stone Hall This, as we have&#xD;
seen, had filled the heart of Mrs. Summerfield&#xD;
with uneasiness, roused to anxiety, when he de-&#xD;
clined her invitation to dinner. Well it might&#xD;
be so in a place where domestic and social pro-&#xD;
priety of conduct is so strictly enforced and ob-&#xD;
served, and where a departure from established&#xD;
nile. of manners is visited with the same severity&#xD;
as a dereliction from morals. It was well known&#xD;
throughout the whole section of country, that the&#xD;
heiress of Red-Stone Hall was affianced to Colonel&#xD;
Dangerfield ;-.that she had been withdrawn from&#xD;
school to fulfil this engagement; that CQlonel&#xD;
Dangerfield had made splendid preparations at&#xD;
"The Soldier's Rest" for the reception of his&#xD;
bride, and gossip about the costly furniture im-&#xD;
ported from London, Paris, and Constantinople,&#xD;
was circulated with the usual quantum of ex-&#xD;
aggeration, until curiosity was on the qui-vive for&#xD;
the day when the imposing nuptial~ should be&#xD;
celebrated, and the magnificent mansion with its&#xD;
superb apartments, gorgeous furniture, and splen-&#xD;
did decorations, should be thrown open to public&#xD;
reception and inspection. But days had chased&#xD;
days; weeks had slipped gter weeks; months&#xD;
had followed months; ~ second year had&#xD;
succeeded the first, an4 silver edged and sil-&#xD;
ver sealed cards of invitation summoned the&#xD;
eighborlng gentry to Red-Stone Hall; and the&#xD;
eet repose of the Soldier's Rest was ixi-&#xD;
roken-and what had befallen the wedding?&#xD;
&#xD;
109&#xD;
&#xD;
The good people of Jefferson County, you may&#xD;
be certain, had something to talk about. The&#xD;
perfect sleep of the Soldier's Rest remained un-&#xD;
disturbed;-the gorgeous saloons, halls and cham-&#xD;
bers remained closed ;-ali except the bachelor&#xD;
apartments of Colonel Dangerfield, situated in&#xD;
one of the back buildings. The curious passer&#xD;
by, peering through the semi-circle of lofty&#xD;
Lombardy poplar trees that surrounded the front&#xD;
of the lawn, saw only through their foliage a&#xD;
distant, broad expanse of glistening white mar-.&#xD;
ble, with row above row of highly polished, dark&#xD;
mahogany shutters, closely shut-the front view&#xD;
of the mansion white, cold, impenetrable and re-&#xD;
pellant as the brow of its lady elect.&#xD;
But as in the woman, could you have seen be-&#xD;
low that cold, severe surface, you would have&#xD;
shrunk away in horror, scorched and blinded by&#xD;
the fire burning there,-burning more intensely,&#xD;
consumingly, for its very suppression ;-so in&#xD;
the mansion could you have passed those marble&#xD;
walls, and through those polished oak galleries,&#xD;
halls and saloons, you might have come to a&#xD;
room where the light of day was excluded, where&#xD;
among the deep shadows sat or moved a tall,&#xD;
dark form-like a bad thought in a black heart~&#xD;
a dark form, gloomy and glowering, upon whose&#xD;
countenance the lurid glare of a red coal fire cast.&#xD;
up a weird, demoniac lght, giving the passion-&#xD;
ploughed visage a yet more fell and fatal aspect;&#xD;
and you might have fancied that this white and&#xD;
glistening marble palace was the snow-covered&#xD;
surface of a volcano, and this murky room, with&#xD;
its deep black shadows and lurid red light, was&#xD;
the centre, the forge of the burning lava, and&#xD;
this dark giant moving among them the demon'-&#xD;
prince of the earthquake and fiery irruption.&#xD;
And there might have been more truth than&#xD;
fancy in the conceit, for in that house, in that&#xD;
room, in that form, in that ,1wart~ lurked, burned&#xD;
the spark of a passion, should it blaze out, fatal&#xD;
as ever fiery flood that, bursting from the bosom&#xD;
of a volcano, buried a city in hot lava-deeply&#xD;
wounded self.esteem-jealousy that had outlived&#xD;
the love that first gave it birth&#xD;
Now as he walked about the floor-the fire&#xD;
casting his long, black shadow up to the ceiling&#xD;
-he seemed restless, anxious with the expecta-&#xD;
tion of somebody, or something; he would go to&#xD;
the window, look out into the night, return and&#xD;
trim the fire, walk twice or thrice across the&#xD;
floor, open the door and peer out into the dark-&#xD;
ness. At last the light, swift fall of a palfrey's&#xD;
hoofs fell on his ear, and then starting, he seized&#xD;
a paper match, applied it to the fire, then to the&#xD;
wicks of a chandelier hanging from the ceiling,&#xD;
and lot the scene was changed as by enchant-&#xD;
ment. It was no longer a baleful, black figure,&#xD;
moving fearfully amid black darkness,~ made&#xD;
visible by gleams of lurid red flame. The rays&#xD;
of the chandelier poured down in a thousand&#xD;
rainbow-colored streams of dazzling light, upoa~&#xD;

&#xD;
the form of a very handsome martial looking&#xD;
man in the prime of life, arrayed in a splendid&#xD;
undress uniform, and standing amid a scene of&#xD;
luxury a sultan might have envied. Of all the&#xD;
gorgeous apartments in that magnificent man-&#xD;
sion, none could compare with this small room&#xD;
for the very perfection of its adornments. The&#xD;
chandelier had just blazed around, when the door&#xD;
opened, and Sina Hinton stood in the midst of&#xD;
the scene; her small, slight figure attired in a&#xD;
closely fitting crimson satin, her jet black hair&#xD;
pendant in a mass of glittering spirals down her&#xD;
beautifully rounded shoulders, her thin, fierce&#xD;
face sparkling with excitement. Colonel Danger-&#xD;
field made an impulsive start, as though he would&#xD;
have caught her to his bosom, but with a quick,&#xD;
fierce gesture, she repelled him. Casting her&#xD;
riding hat with all its plumes down upon the&#xD;
carpet, she threw herself into a luxurious chair,&#xD;
and lay there, her crimson drapery warmly glow-&#xD;
ing in the light of the chandelier, her form and&#xD;
face palpitating, quivering, sparkling, blaring&#xD;
not unlike a small mass of fire, or a grenade half&#xD;
exploded, that still continues to jet and sparkle.&#xD;
Colonel Dangerfield checked the first impulse of&#xD;
astonishment, composed himself and approached&#xD;
Iter soothingly,&#xD;
"Why, Sina, Sina. What is the matter, Sina,&#xD;
*    Sina ?" he said, cautiously approaching his hand&#xD;
to her h~ad, and deprecatingly, furtively'stro-&#xD;
king her head, as you would that of a fierce,&#xD;
beautiful pet cat you wished to caress, yet fear&#xD;
ed it should bite. Wh' then, Sina, Sina, my&#xD;
little salamander! my little fire queen, what is it?&#xD;
Who has set a match to my little powder maga-&#xD;
zine, now? Who now has fired my little gre-&#xD;
nade?"&#xD;
Sne struck off his hand sharply. He folded&#xD;
his arms across his chest thenand stood quietly&#xD;
and silently before her, watching her still glow-&#xD;
ing, sparkling scintillating with agitation.&#xD;
"Recollect yourself, Colonel Dangerfield, and&#xD;
respect me," she said at last, fiercely.&#xD;
He remained in the same attitude, patiently&#xD;
waiting for her to recover herself. At last, in~&#xD;
spied by a bright idea, he turned to a small but&#xD;
elegant table, upon which stood several cut-glass&#xD;
decanters and wine glasses, and pouring out&#xD;
some wine, brought it to her. She pushed it&#xD;
away, saying,&#xD;
"No-would you add fire to fever? Water!"&#xD;
Obediently he brought a glass of water, and&#xD;
taking it, she quaffed it at a draught. This&#xD;
cooled her somewhat. Returning the glass to&#xD;
him, she said,&#xD;
"Dangerfield, bear with me! You should not&#xD;
cress me in a mood like this-when the wild-cat&#xD;
is stirred up in me as it has been to-right I"&#xD;
~s Compose yourself, Sina."&#xD;
"Vorgiv-' me-another glass of water I thank&#xD;
you. I am steadied now.. -IA.p.. Dangerfieldi&#xD;
you got my note 1"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes, my delightful little torpedo, I receive&#xD;
your note; and have prepared my poor, lonely&#xD;
apartments as I best could, for this bright&#xD;
presence 1,,&#xD;
"Ah I Mary, Virgin Mother I am I never to&#xD;
be free from this sort of address ?"&#xD;
"What mean you ?"&#xD;
"Colonel Dangerlield I I have been indiscreet&#xD;
in coming to your house; yet if you knew the&#xD;
motive that has driven me to throw myself thus&#xD;
upon your magnanimity for protection-you&#xD;
would excuse-you would pity-succor the de-&#xD;
fenceless orphan girl !'~ wept Sina, bowing tier&#xD;
head till all her bright ringlets fell, veil like,&#xD;
over her witching face.&#xD;
"My dearest girl, explain yourself! do, Sina!&#xD;
Come! I am your friend-confide in me," said&#xD;
he, kindly taking her hand, and looking in her&#xD;
countenance.&#xD;
Sina turned her face away-stooped till her&#xD;
ringlets fell and veiled it, and then said, in a half&#xD;
stifled voice,&#xD;
"How shall I. tell you! how shall 1 tell you&#xD;
with this garish light glaring around-with your&#xD;
eye upon me; how, oh! Virgin Mother! shall I&#xD;
tell you! you of all men ?"&#xD;
"Nay now, I entreat you speak, Sina! Come,&#xD;
speak low! 1 will listen."&#xD;
"Ah, Dangerfield! can you not imagine the&#xD;
only thing that would drive me from 04k Giove,&#xD;
to seek advice and assistance of you-what!&#xD;
no answer! Shall I have to tell you then-"&#xD;
continued Sina, in a smothered voice, burying&#xD;
her face in the cushion. "That, that, that Oak&#xD;
Grove, that Squire Darling~s house is no longer&#xD;
a fit and proper home for me! There. it is&#xD;
out!"&#xD;
"SinaI Miss Hinton, you surprise me beyond&#xD;
measure!"&#xD;
"Is not my position a cruel one? Oh, is&#xD;
it not ?"&#xD;
"My dear Sina-my dear young lady, could&#xD;
you not have sought shelter with Mrs. Summer-&#xD;
field."&#xD;
C~Ah, sir! do you not see the reusori why I&#xD;
could not; the brother and sister-the father and&#xD;
daughter-the uncle and niece, so long estranged&#xD;
-so recently re-united; would you have bad&#xD;
me, for any selfish motive of my own, however&#xD;
excusable, expose that wrong which would have&#xD;
made more mischief between them?"&#xD;
This was said with an air of sincerity that&#xD;
would have deceived an angel-it thoroughly&#xD;
gulled Colonel Dangerfield.&#xD;
"True! most true, my high-hearted girl!'&#xD;
"Therefore, sirs I 4sne to you, as the only&#xD;
friend I knew. I cocts~ to ask you to procure,&#xD;
among your i~umerous acquaintances, a place 55&#xD;
governess in some gentleman's family for me-&#xD;
and to do it quickly; and to consider with wie&#xD;
how I shall g' t of-what oxi-use I shall make,&#xD;
so as not to expose Squire Darling to his sisl~er's&#xD;
&#xD;
indignation! Can you assist me in my de-&#xD;
sign?"&#xD;
"Undoubtedly! But, Sina, I love you! love&#xD;
you! Let my love shield you from this servi-&#xD;
tude you would enter! ah, hear me, Sina!"&#xD;
'.Colonel Dangerfield lit is late; I must re-&#xD;
turn home," said Miss Hinton, rising and pick-&#xD;
ing up her hat.&#xD;
But Colonel Dangerfield caught her hand, and&#xD;
gently forcing her back into' the chair, said,&#xD;
"Not yet, Sina-and not alone; I must ride&#xD;
with you, when you go. And now you must&#xD;
listen to me. 1 love you, ~&#xD;
~ "Sir, I must depart."&#xD;
"Sina, my bird, you must not yet! Sina, I&#xD;
love you! love you; and you love me! Tell me&#xD;
that my affection is not altogether indifferent to&#xD;
"Sir! Sir! those are words you should not&#xD;
speak; I should not hear I"&#xD;
"You love me, Sina !"&#xD;
"Let me depart, sir !"&#xD;
"Yo~i do love me! every word and gesture&#xD;
proves it! Now tell me why these words are&#xD;
"Oh, sir! for many reasons. Miss Summer-&#xD;
field--"&#xD;
"'Miss Summerfield!' Well, you said there&#xD;
were mcny reasons; what others 7"&#xD;
"Sir. if Miss Summerfield were~ out of the&#xD;
queetion-you are a wealthy man! I a poor&#xD;
~' Why, so much the better! Come, gina! any&#xD;
more reasons-come-come-- coma;" and with&#xD;
every ward, he approached his hand towards&#xD;
Sina's curie, as though he would have played&#xD;
with them-but Miss Hinton drew off and re-&#xD;
pulsed him. Never had SlIm permitted him so&#xD;
much as to lift her dark little hand to his lips.&#xD;
"I assure you, dearest Sina, you are a very in.&#xD;
consistent girl-you are at once the most prudish,&#xD;
and the roost indiscreet girl I ever saw! Come&#xD;
now! I challenge you to set up another reason&#xD;
for me to overthrow. Ahi you cannot do~ it I"&#xD;
"Yes, sir, I cans" said Sina, turning suddenly&#xD;
with one of her dazzling, blinding smiles; "yes,&#xD;
sir, I can! a rule my mother taught me before I i&#xD;
ever left her I"&#xD;
"Good! your mother's rule-what was it?"&#xD;
"Au! I will not tell you I"&#xD;
"I insist upon hearing it. Com~, your last I&#xD;
reason for not responding to my love; your mo- (&#xD;
other's rule."&#xD;
"Never to talL~ of love, till my lover talked of 3&#xD;
Srr'sage!" said Sina, with an arch, bright, be- ii&#xD;
Wildering smile.&#xD;
Colonel Dangerheld grew serious all of a sud- i&#xD;

"Then we must settle where to meet as we&#xD;
go along," said Colonel Dangerfield.&#xD;
They left the luxurious room. He placed her&#xD;
in her saddle and leaving her there went and got&#xD;
his own horse in preference to calling a servant&#xD;
under all the circumstances, and throwing him-&#xD;
self into his saddle, he rode swiftly around and&#xD;
rejoined Sina A half hour's brisk ride brought&#xD;
them ~o O&amp;amp;k Grove. &amp;amp;t the gate Colonel Dan-&#xD;
gerfield said,&#xD;
"Now, Sina, I must see you once more soon,&#xD;
my dear girl, let me come here, that is the&#xD;
stra fht forward and proper course."&#xD;
ANn! no! ~ot here! not yet! Stop! I shall&#xD;
be at vespers Sunday afternoon. I shall wait in&#xD;
our cm tamed seat near the confessional used by&#xD;
Father Burleigh! that is a safe and most unex-&#xD;
cepionable place of meeting, for I shall stay&#xD;
after vespers to confession, as it is Father Bur-&#xD;
leigh's Sunday in the bo~ - the Sunday after&#xD;
next being Mr~ Vellemonte's. Do not you come&#xD;
into my pest until after vespers and after the con-&#xD;
gregation has left. Good-night! good-night!"&#xD;
"A kiss, Sina, one kiss!"&#xD;
"No, no, I save such marks of affection ror&#xD;
my husband, whoever he shall be," laughed Sina,&#xD;
flu tig through the gate and casting back a smile&#xD;
and glance so full of glamour, that. Dangerfield&#xD;
liked to have leaped the fence after her.&#xD;
" Air!" smiled the wily girl to herself, "I&#xD;
think I shai.l bring about something at this&#xD;
chapel yet. I heard Imogene's pretty love story&#xD;
once I'll see if I can't hear it again in com-&#xD;
pany. It is too good to be enjoyed sobus. And&#xD;
as for Dangerfield, he must be the company, be-&#xD;
cause seeing and hearing is believing." Then&#xD;
she stabled her horse, and softly entering the&#xD;
house passed up the stairs.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIV.&#xD;
FHR vESPER HOUR AT 5AORED HEART.&#xD;
Sunday came. The Sunday upon which lmo.&#xD;
gene Summerfield was, according to promise, to&#xD;
unburden her bosom of "the perilous stuff" that&#xD;
had so long lain and festered there. Miss Sun.&#xD;
merfield was serene, though still melancholy.&#xD;
The corrugated brow, the strained eye, the col-&#xD;
lapsed cheeks and angular lines of anguish were I&#xD;
no longer visible-nor was her sleep that preter-&#xD;
natural ecstacy it had seemed before. Srae was&#xD;
in her chamber that morning preparing to ac-&#xD;
company her mother to church. It was the&#xD;
habit of those families who lived ten, fifteen,&#xD;
and even twenty miles from Sacred Roart, to&#xD;
leave home very early on Sunday morning, or Pu.&#xD;
mediately after a very early breakfast, and go to&#xD;
church to stay all day, that is through the early&#xD;
mass, the sermon, and the evening vespers-ta.&#xD;
king with them one or two servants and u ham-&#xD;
per of provisions. And it is one of the queer&#xD;
and picturesque sights periuliar, I believe, to the&#xD;
old and sparsely settled counties of MaryLand and&#xD;
Virginia, to see the small country church, in its&#xD;
grove of trees, with carriages and horses tied to&#xD;
almost every tree, and after the sermon, negroes&#xD;
lounging about, or feeding horses, and famiLes&#xD;
at lunch in their carriages or even in their pews.&#xD;
Mrs. Summerfield, besides a hamper of provi-&#xD;
sions for her own family, always took a bottle of&#xD;
crusted port or of champagne, and some rare&#xD;
dainty besides for Father Burleigh; and frequent.&#xD;
by after vespers were over in the evening, Miss&#xD;
Mattie Smilie would come to her pew door with&#xD;
her round face, meek, chastened smile and plea-&#xD;
sant voice, and press Mrs. Summerfield and&#xD;
'*Miss Imogene" to stop in at the cottage and&#xD;
take a cup of tea and some of her nice egg-pont&#xD;
to warm them before their ride home-and as&#xD;
frequently Mrs. Summerfield would smilingly&#xD;
accept the affectionate invitation. That little&#xD;
Miss Mattie was so neat and nice and fragrant!&#xD;
though I think somehow or other the dear old&#xD;
soul never got any new clothes. In church you&#xD;
might always see her in a faded light calico&#xD;
gown "clean as a penny," and "neat as a new&#xD;
pin," and a faded, light colored cleaa shawl, and&#xD;
an old-fashioned clean straw bonnet, with, a&#xD;
washed and ironed ribbon on it, with a blue-&#xD;
white crimped, full cap border all around her&#xD;
dear old edifying face. And there was always&#xD;
that smell of fragrant dried herbs about, her, for&#xD;
Miss Mattie's clothes, house, table, and bed&#xD;
linen, when not in use, were literally "laid up in&#xD;
lavender," or bergamot, or sweet marjoram, or&#xD;
sassafras, for her clean old chest-drawers and&#xD;
presses were full of them. And indeed in my&#xD;
infancy when [ heard for the first time of the&#xD;
"odor of sanctity," I thought it had reference&#xD;
to Miss Mattie, her fragrant dried herbs and her&#xD;
&#xD;
SHANN(&#xD;
5~~flf5~ relics. When in her extreme old age I&#xD;
once visited herald she hung around my neck&#xD;
an Agsrus Dei, a small pink satin heart stuffed,&#xD;
and in the very middle of the stuffing a relic t)3e&#xD;
size of half a rice grain, saying it was the bones&#xD;
of St. Agnes, Virgin and Martyr, and that it was&#xD;
a "protection against temptation"-it smelt so&#xD;
fragrant of lavender and bergamot, that saints&#xD;
bones and aromatic dried herbs entered my head&#xD;
together, and have never been separated since.&#xD;
She used to make me fancy, too, in spite of all&#xD;
the glistening and bristling new finery of a&#xD;
country church, that light colored "fady" cali-&#xD;
coes, and old poke bonnets with washed and&#xD;
ironed ribbons, were the very neatest and sweetest&#xD;
dress in the world. One thing I felt sure, that&#xD;
Miss (~Iattie was the very cleanest, neatest, most&#xD;
fragrant little fat and rosy old lady 1 ever looked&#xD;
at, and the mildest, meekest, most composing&#xD;
and refreshing old lady I ever talked with. She&#xD;
had but one trouble in the world, and that was,&#xD;
as she would say, with her good smile, "Poor&#xD;
Sammy and his ways," meaning-if you have&#xD;
"forgotten to remember" the relation-Mr.&#xD;
Sammy Smilie of Harper's Ferry, and she only&#xD;
regretted her poverty because she would have&#xD;
no money to leave to pay for having masses said&#xD;
for the repose of Sammy's soul after his death.&#xD;
No bright young child, no beautiful and good&#xD;
girl ever brought more quiet sunshine into a&#xD;
church or dwelling than did Miss Mattie, with&#xD;
her edifying manners, as I said, half bonhom-&#xD;
mb, half beatitude. She would mildly and smi-&#xD;
lingly exhort the rich to trust in God and try this&#xD;
nice soup, in the same sentence; and talk of the&#xD;
joys of Heaven, and the juices of this nice new&#xD;
ham so strengthening to the stomach and so gocd&#xD;
to coax a lingering appetite, in the same breath.&#xD;
She would kneel down quite naturally arid pray&#xD;
for the conversion of people's souls and the cure of&#xD;
their cholics, in the same tone. I am not sure&#xD;
when her chickens had the pip that she did not&#xD;
make it a subject of fasting and prayer. I knew&#xD;
very well when she lost her well worn and faded&#xD;
thread gloves, she fasted and prayed every day&#xD;
till they were found, for she told old Nerve so,&#xD;
who replied to her,&#xD;
"Well! I should be afraid to bother my bless-&#xD;
ed heavenly Marster about such trifles."&#xD;
c~But, honey, it wezrn't a true, it cost me&#xD;
three-fippenny bits, and I had not had 'em over&#xD;
two years, and they were jest as gqod as bran new&#xD;
except that there was about six or seven, or in-&#xD;
deed for that matter it might have been eight&#xD;
little darns in 'em; and that-was-all, and&#xD;
neither do I think that the Blessed Lord and the&#xD;
ever blessed Virgin ia in defiant to what grieves&#xD;
their childun-~even gloves - because you see,&#xD;
honey, I sinful poor creature as I am, pity even&#xD;
a little duck with the gapes5 or a fly drowned in&#xD;

But this is a flagrant digression-I must&#xD;
stop. Though I could go on much farther With&#xD;
details about the old priest's housekeeper, very&#xD;
interesting to me, certainly, but not so much&#xD;
so I fancy to you, and I some how regret that at&#xD;
the end of this tale of real life, I shall have to&#xD;
drop Miss Mattie without having made you ac-&#xD;
quainted with half her meek and enduring&#xD;
virtues.&#xD;
Mrs. Summerfield had put her basket of lunch&#xD;
into the hands of her servant, with directions&#xD;
to stow it away in the box of the carriage, and&#xD;
to mount himself, speedily, and be ready to at-&#xD;
tend them to open the gates, and then she had&#xD;
gone up stairs to see Imogene before their depar-&#xD;
ture.&#xD;
~C How do you feel now, my dearest child ?"&#xD;
she asked, stealing her arm around her Waist as&#xD;
she stood before a glass arranging her hair,&#xD;
"Calm, mother, very calm."&#xD;
"I am pleased, Imogene, there is one thing I&#xD;
never mentioned to you."&#xD;
"Well, mother ?"&#xD;
"That night upon which I woke you up, was&#xD;
not the ~rst night I had watched by you while&#xD;
sleeping."&#xD;
"My dear, dear mother! did I merit such&#xD;
goodness at your hands ?"&#xD;
"Yes, Imogene, my love, why not? Besides,&#xD;
Imogene, I will tell you-what--now I fear you&#xD;
will never prove, in your own self, namely-that&#xD;
a mother's love never slumbers nor sleeps. But,&#xD;
Imogene, there at your bedside I witnessed a&#xD;
phenomenon I cannot ~&#xD;
"Well, mother ?"&#xD;
"Pei~haps you can explain ~&#xD;
"I do not know-let me hear it."&#xD;
"You-but tell me first, how did you usually&#xD;
rest, imogene ?"&#xD;
"Delightfully, mother. My life, indeed, was&#xD;
'two-fold-sleep had its own world."'&#xD;
"Ab !-go on."&#xD;
"Full of bitterest remorse, and most insuffer-&#xD;
able anguish, as my days were, mother, I could&#xD;
not tell you how delicious were my nights, my'&#xD;
dreams-nor how the blissful visions of the&#xD;
night enhanced the misery of the next day. It&#xD;
was a psychological mystery, mother !-I had&#xD;
no control over my dreams. I have believed in&#xD;
the possibility of controlling dreams, but I could&#xD;
not do it. I would pray, read, fall asleep re-&#xD;
peating a prayer, and instantly be transported&#xD;
by sleep into another world-into a higher, deep..&#xD;
or, broader, fuller sense of existence, into the&#xD;
midst of visions that Would seem far more real&#xD;
to me than does this waking life."&#xD;
"And the specific nature of' those visions,&#xD;
Imogene ?"&#xD;
"It is difficult to recall them In all their glory,&#xD;
mother-mother, they leave on my mind a vague&#xD;
memory of unutterable happiness, for which I&#xD;
should nevertheless feel unmitigated regret, for&#xD;

my idol-the priest, Claude Vellemonte I"&#xD;
"Oh, Imogene !"&#xD;
"Listen, mother, as soon as I fell asleep, he&#xD;
stood by my side; we wandered, hand-in-hand,&#xD;
through marble halls, cooled with sparkling&#xD;
fountains; perfumed with myriads of flowers;&#xD;
musical with millions of birds; and thence, into&#xD;
the saloons, hung with richest and rarest paint-&#xD;
ings, with niches filled with marble statues;&#xD;
through, into chambers of more splendor and&#xD;
luxury than Eastern poetry and magnificence&#xD;
could imagine; and thence again, into gardens&#xD;
of more than ideal beauty, and exuberance of&#xD;
exotic vegetation; and through orchards of rich&#xD;
and blooming tropical fruit; into vineyards,&#xD;
where the purple grape, like clusters of rubies,&#xD;
hung amid leaves of emeralds; out into fields of&#xD;
ever fresh verdure, cool and green, and gently&#xD;
undulating off to the distant light-blue, transpa-&#xD;

with its navies and sea-ports; the broad conti-&#xD;
nents, with their long rivers, lofty mountains,&#xD;
burning volcanoes, nations, kingdoms, towns and&#xD;
cities I All these passed in panorama before&#xD;
our vision! Yet, mother, in all this, my happi-&#xD;
ness-the very climax of my joy was-6y my I&#xD;
side! Can I tell you how we talked? The&#xD;
earth floated off below, as we soared into space.&#xD;
Then, looking down, we saw the floating globe. I&#xD;
That vision of the earth, seen from above, is&#xD;
distinct in my memory. The great globe of I&#xD;
forest-covered land, and isle-studded water, with&#xD;
the Northern icebergs glancing in the sun. I I&#xD;
never realized how little room the cities, towns&#xD;
and villages-all the dwelling places of man, j&#xD;
took up in the green earth, till I saw it in my I&#xD;
dream, floating below me, like a ball of green&#xD;
and variegated land, sparsely enameled with&#xD;
cities; and of blue water, thinly dotted with&#xD;
islands. Then, mother! what shall I tell you I&#xD;
of the glory of the heavens, as seen in my vision&#xD;
-worlds-oh, as far more glorious than this., as I&#xD;
the sun at noon-day is more glorious than a taper. I&#xD;
I tire you, mother.?' t&#xD;
"No-but that will do-I understand now the e&#xD;
happiness of your sleep, I have heard physi. I&#xD;
clans say, that some mindo absorbed in sorrow s&#xD;
all day, will, by a natural re-action, a merciful d&#xD;
law of our being-pass into another set of ideas, I&#xD;
and dream blissfully at night. I sometimes c&#xD;

quested to be left alone in the church. Her&#xD;
wien excited no surprise. It was not unusual-&#xD;
such retirement, for self-examination and prayer&#xD;
in the time of Lent So Imogene was left to&#xD;
her meditations in the lonely church, while the&#xD;
rest of the party migrated to the cottage parlor.&#xD;
In their route thither, they passed several par-&#xD;
ties, like themselves, coming from a distance,&#xD;
and staying all day at church. Dear little Miss&#xD;
Mattie smiled, and nodded meekly, as she pass-&#xD;
ed them, looking very much as though she would&#xD;
like to have them all along, but that was im-&#xD;
possible-the tiny cottage not having the capa-&#xD;
cit.ies of a large hotel for accommodation; so&#xD;
Miss Mattie bad to content herself with promis-&#xD;

Sabbath, and all, each in their turn. Squire&#xD;
Darling followed last of all, with his little ring-&#xD;
lotted infatuation still hanging on his arm.&#xD;

ing, yet triumphant mood.&#xD;
Miss Hinton dropped her long, black lashes,&#xD;
~.nd long, black ringlets, and looked persecuted&#xD;
and patient. She was temporarily delivered&#xD;
from her tyrant, at the pic-nic dinner-table in&#xD;
the cottage kitchen.&#xD;
Evening came. Vespers were over. The con-&#xD;
gregation were departing. Squire Darling with&#xD;
a look of huge gratification tucked his beautiful&#xD;
crimson sin under his arm, and prepared for a&#xD;
start, saying, brutally,&#xD;
"Ah! my dear Cardialgy-not here this&#xD;
evening either! however, misery likes company,&#xD;
my dear Ruby, and there is Miss Harry, whose&#xD;
heart is breaking too, in the same cause-and&#xD;
there is my superb niece looking like a martyr,&#xD;
infatuated with the stake! Come along, Cardi-&#xD;
..lgy, let us go home."&#xD;
"Thank you sir! I have accepted an invita-&#xD;
tion from Mrs Summerfield, to. return with her&#xD;
to-night!" said Miss Hinton, with a look of&#xD;
malice.&#xD;
"The d-l you have !" exclaimed the thun-&#xD;
derstruck and enraged squire.&#xD;
*Hep.rt.burn.&#xD;
&#xD;
ONDALE.&#xD;
It was no use though. His anger was per-&#xD;
fectly impotent. He was tempted to go to his&#xD;
sister, with Sina under his arm, and say to her,&#xD;
"Here! this is the cause of the fatal estrange.&#xD;
ment between Dangerfield and Imogene,"-but&#xD;
as I said before, in his greatest fury, Siria's honor&#xD;
was not forgotten. Re would bitterly upbraid&#xD;
and brutally tyrannize over her himself, but he&#xD;
would not expose her to the slightest reproach&#xD;
from any otherT-so the squire bolted his fury,&#xD;
and took leave of Sina and his sister, telling hex&#xD;
that he should send the carriage for Miss Hinton,&#xD;
early the next morning- Mrs. Summerfield went&#xD;
again into the cottage, to wait until her daugh-&#xD;
ter's religious exercises were over. Father Bur-&#xD;
leigh went into the confessional.&#xD;
Miss Summerfield-her pale brow still lumi-&#xD;
nous with the glory of inspiration, passed on to&#xD;
the church~ The inside of the church -the&#xD;
splendid altar-the gorgeous pictures-were all&#xD;
glorious in the golden lustre of the setting sun,&#xD;
that pouring through the western windows, yel-&#xD;
low-flooded the whole sdene. The altar occu-&#xD;
pied the centre of the north end-the pulpit&#xD;
the right hand corner, and the confessional the&#xD;
left hand; both these were hung with scarlet&#xD;
drapery, and glowed hotly in the sunshine--a few&#xD;
moments-and then-even as Imogene entered&#xD;
the confessional-the 5~~5 disc dropped behind&#xD;
the near mountain, and the whole church fell&#xD;
into sudden gloom.&#xD;
It was about this time, that Sina-expressing&#xD;
a wish to retire to the church and prepare her&#xD;
soul by seif-examisration and pray&amp;amp;, for the sa-&#xD;
crament of confession-left Mrs Summerfield.&#xD;
It was deep twilight gloom, when she softly&#xD;
glided in her serpentine motion up the aisle and&#xD;
slippeJ into a closely curtained box, near the&#xD;
confessional, and never used but as a place of&#xD;
strict retiracy for meditation, previous to con-&#xD;
fession.&#xD;
She had been here perhaps five minutes, whpn&#xD;
the curtains were parted and another person en-&#xD;
tered. It was Col. Dangerfield. He pressed her&#xD;
hand in silence, awed by the holy stillness of&#xD;
the place, and passed on to the seat she indicated&#xD;
on the other side of herself, and nearest the con-&#xD;
fessional. He sat down and turned to speak to&#xD;
her-when she raised her linger to her lips, in&#xD;
token of silence, just as the profound stillness of&#xD;
the church was broken by the low tones of a&#xD;
deep, rich voice, saying-"Bless me, Father, be-&#xD;
cause I have sinned." He recognized Imogene's&#xD;
full, round tones, in the opening of the ritual.&#xD;
There was a pauses-disturbed bythe solemn, but&#xD;
inaudible voice of the aged priest. Col. Danger-&#xD;
field with a start of surprise-got up-would&#xD;
have left the pew, but that Sina put her hand&#xD;
upon him, with an imploring look, and pressed&#xD;
him down into his seat, just as Miss Summer-&#xD;
field's low, melodious voice was heard again in&#xD;
the comfiteor-but the words were nearly inau-&#xD;
&#xD;
S I-I AN N 0&#xD;
dible, until she was heard to murmur, "I accuse&#xD;
myself of having given to the creature-the love&#xD;
-the adoration- -the worship due only to God"&#xD;
Then, her voice was again inaudible during the&#xD;
five or ten minutes that her rich, deep tones&#xD;
trembled onward in her story. Then her voico&#xD;
ceased. There was a dead, dead pause.-&#xD;
Again Colonel Dangerfield started to icave, but&#xD;
Sina turning very pale, leaned against the front&#xD;
of the pew, barricading the door, and signed to&#xD;
him that she felt extremely agitated-horrified&#xD;
by what it appeared she had heard, though he&#xD;
had not! she signed to him to wait a moment,&#xD;
until she should have recovered herself. Re&#xD;
dropped again into his seat, with a dark frown&#xD;
of impatience. This eaves-dropping, although&#xD;
it was, on his part, and he believed on Sina's,&#xD;
quite involuntary, and although he actually as&#xD;
yet, bad heard little or nothing,-was neverthe-&#xD;
less, extremely repugnant to his sense of honor.&#xD;
Now the deep, stern, awful voice of the priest&#xD;
arose-yes, deep, stern and awful as that of the&#xD;
Judge at the last day-falling upon the ears of&#xD;
the stout soldier, and of the little demon by his&#xD;
side with awful impression-with the thunder&#xD;
of the final doom. The first words of the so-&#xD;
lemn denunciation were lost, and nothing was&#xD;
heard distinctly until he said,&#xD;
"And lastly, oh, thou pernicious girl 1-since&#xD;
thou hast dared in defiance of God'.~ blighting&#xD;
curse, to lift thy impious thoughts and sacrilegi&#xD;
ous eyes up to the Lord's annointed-the holy&#xD;
one of Israel-the beloved son 01 Christ-the&#xD;
gi1te~l young brother whose exalted piety has&#xD;
endowed him, in the opinion of the people, with&#xD;
the gift even of miracles-hear thy sentence I-&#xD;
through thy very sin shalt thou do penance!-&#xD;
through thy very sin shalt thou have added to&#xD;
the fires of consuming remorse-the shame of&#xD;
utter self-abasement, and of utter humiliation!&#xD;
Hear! To this pure and holy man shalt thou go,&#xD;
and to him, who, in the untarnished image of&#xD;
hi. Maker, is of too pure eyes to behold iniquity,&#xD;
-to him shalt thou confess thy impious-thy sa-&#xD;
creligious love-that in his utter loathing of thy&#xD;
degradation and thy guilt, thou mayest grow to&#xD;
apprehend its enormity; and from him shalt thou&#xD;
receive the sentence of penance, he shall think&#xD;
most necessary to expiate thy atrocious crime,&#xD;
and to save thy else too surely lost soul, from ut-&#xD;
ter perdition!"&#xD;
A long, low scream of "mercy! mercy!" a&#xD;
heavy fall-and then Colonel Dangerfield, start-&#xD;
ing to his feet, upsetting his little devil in his&#xD;
haste, and rushing to the confessional, raised the&#xD;
fainting form of Imogene Summerfi~ld~ and bore&#xD;
it from the church, and into the cottage.&#xD;
*      .      .     .      a      a&#xD;
An hour afterwards, Imogene opened her eyes.&#xD;
The shame, the terror, the anguish, were alJ&#xD;
gene. Her face revealed a heavenly serenity-&#xD;
nay, indeed, it seemed that while her body had&#xD;
&#xD;
NUA1S~E                               117&#xD;
beer. lying in insensiburty. her soul must have&#xD;
been in heaven, and received some divine inspi-&#xD;
ration, for when she opened her eyes, her coUrt-&#xD;
tenance beamed with a celestial glory, even on&#xD;
the stern old priest bending over her bed; and&#xD;
her tones were full of earnest love when taking&#xD;
his hard, old hand between her own, she said, "I&#xD;
thank you for making him my judge! I accept&#xD;
it! to him will I reveal my whole soul-from&#xD;
him receive my sentence-and suffer it, what.&#xD;
ever it be, with, oh! how much joy I"&#xD;
"Sina, I am free! Sina, will you have me?"&#xD;
~Yes.~&#xD;
Then, Colonel Dangerfield folded the wily sy-&#xD;
ren to his bosom, imprinting on her lips the very&#xD;
first kiss she had ever permitted, deeming him-&#xD;
self "very blest."&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXV.&#xD;
THE DEMONIAC.&#xD;
I am disgraced, impeached and baffled here;&#xD;
Pierced to the ~il with anger'e venomed spear;&#xD;
The which no b~1m can cure but his heart's blood,&#xD;
Which breathed this poison. Shakspeare&#xD;
True to his promise or his threat, Squire Dar-&#xD;
ling had sent his carriage over to Re',-Stone&#xD;
early the next morning; and as Mrs Simmer-&#xD;
field, pre-occupied and abstracted. did not h'n.k&#xD;
~to invite Miss Hinton to prolong her stay at Red-&#xD;
Stone, our syren had no alternative but to return&#xD;
to her hated home. As she was about to enter&#xD;
the carriage, a servant of Colonel Dangerfield's&#xD;
rode up and put a note in her hand. She opened&#xD;
it hastily and read&#xD;
SOLDIERS REST. Monday, April let.&#xD;
Mv DEAREST SINA :-I have been thrown from&#xD;
my carriage and nave been laid up all day-with&#xD;
a sprained ankle-nothing verse. on)y that it&#xD;
prevents me having the pleasure or seeing my&#xD;
dear girl to-flay, and waiting upon Squire Dar-&#xD;
hug, as I intended to do, lot th~ purpose o' an-&#xD;
nouncing to him our engagement. I am so&#xD;
dreadfully ennnyee, that I am almn4 teinpten to&#xD;
ask my brave. in;iscreet girl, to come aid pay&#xD;
me a visit; at least I certainly will not lec' ure her&#xD;
as before if she does, as "circumstances alter&#xD;
cases." Thine, longii.g to s e thee&#xD;
H. L. DANGERFIELD,&#xD;
Miss Hinton put this in her pn.~ke, and the&#xD;
carriage rolled on towards Oak Grove. Arrived&#xD;
at the fork in the road where the leit hand turn&#xD;
led to t.he "Soldier's Rest," Miss Hinton called&#xD;
to the driver,&#xD;
"Uncle Kill! Uncle Kill I"&#xD;
"Turn down to the left; I have a letter to&#xD;
take from Red-Stone Hall to the "Soldier's&#xD;
Rest "&#xD;
"EhI what! yes! certainly, Miss! .ukawas&#xD;
it you said I"&#xD;
&#xD;

118&#xD;
&#xD;
SH A N N&#xD;
&#xD;
Miss Hinton repeated her order.&#xD;
"Can't do it, Miss."&#xD;
'5Wlirst? how dare you, sir, disobey my order?&#xD;
Turn instantly to the left!"&#xD;
"Sorry I can't obligerate you, Miss Sina; but&#xD;
ole master's orders to fetch you straight home&#xD;
were very peremptolute." -&#xD;
"See here, sir i you insolent fellow!" said&#xD;
Sina, burning with rage, "turn immediately&#xD;
where I tell you, or you shall meet with severe&#xD;
punishment."&#xD;
"Tnat may be a doubtingency, Miss Sina, if&#xD;
I don't; whereas, if I does turn out with you,&#xD;
it'! be an absolutive certainty I" and so saying,&#xD;
the old negro put whip to his horses and drove&#xD;
furiously to ~vards Oak Grove&#xD;
Arrived there, Miss Hinton went into the diaw-&#xD;
ing-room, an4 sent for S~nire Darling. Squire&#xD;
Darling was having a conversation with old Kill.&#xD;
Poor old Kill! he thought by his literal obedience&#xD;
to ordei a to merit his master's approbation. So&#xD;
it was with visible delight that he related hie&#xD;
little altercation with Miss Hinton, taking care&#xD;
to say, however, that he would very gladly have&#xD;
obliged Miss ~1inton, if he co* have done so&#xD;
without disobeying his master. Our stout squire&#xD;
fell into a rage with Sines, inhat positively threat-&#xD;
ened to end in an apoplectic fit. But with his&#xD;
habitual care for Miss Hinton's standing in the&#xD;
household, be relieved himself, and deluded and&#xD;
alarmed poor old Kill, by bursting into a fit of&#xD;
violent fury upon kim. demanding to know why&#xD;
he did not mind Miss Hinton? His own com-&#xD;
mands were to be obeyed, it was true, alecats,&#xD;
ex~epiing when Miss Ilinton'i wishes interfered!&#xD;
He (old Kill) knew that! He ought to have his&#xD;
bar" head broken! It should be done the next&#xD;
time such a thing occurred! Now we all know&#xD;
that had poor old Kill committed the mistake of&#xD;
taking Sina to the Soldier's Rest, he would&#xD;
have virtually signed his own passport to&#xD;
cotton fields of Mississippi. And in fact the&#xD;
old man still suspected as much hiq~iself s how-&#xD;
ever, with a deprecating "reverence" he re-&#xD;
plied, that he was very sorry to have mistaken&#xD;
his master's wishes; that it was not yet too late&#xD;
to remedy the error; that the horses were still&#xD;
quite fresh; finally that he could then drive Miss&#xD;
Binton where she wished to go.&#xD;
"No SIR! It is dinner time! Miss Hinton is&#xD;
also very much fatigued I I shall not permit her&#xD;
to go over all that ground again! Begone i"&#xD;
It was at this moment that the message from&#xD;
Sina arrived, calling him into the drawing-room.&#xD;
He went in. putting a violent restraint upon him-&#xD;
self, welcomed her home, and desired to be in-&#xD;
formed of her particular pleasure and purpose in&#xD;
sending for him.                          '1&#xD;
"Colonel Dangerfield 'is indisposed at the&#xD;
'Soldier's Rest.' I am the bearer of a letter&#xD;
from Red-Stone Hall to him. I wished to take&#xD;
it there at once, but your man, Achilles, refused I&#xD;
&#xD;
'ON DALE&#xD;
to drive me thither. Now I wish you i:o give&#xD;
order. that I may go."&#xD;
"Not for tue world, my dear Miss Hinton I&#xD;
you are mad! A young lady visit an unmarried&#xD;
gentleman at his home! Upon no account what.&#xD;
ever! 1 will take the letter myself. Where is&#xD;
it, Sinai"&#xD;
"Excuse me, sir, 1 must only deliver this let.&#xD;
ter with my own hand.'&#xD;
"Ahi who is it from, Sinai My sister?&#xD;
Imogene 1"&#xD;
"Squire Darling, it seems to me that you are&#xD;
cross-questioning me!'&#xD;
ft Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho I" laughed the squire.&#xD;
"No, my dear Sinai but in a word, I cannot&#xD;
send you to the 'Soldier's Rest' to-day upon any&#xD;
pretense whatever! Let the Red-Stone Hall&#xD;
folks find their own messengers. Anything else,&#xD;
Miss Hinton, that I can do for your pleasure-&#xD;
not that! not that, my dear Carditis! It is too&#xD;
much to ask of a man! What, the d-~-.l! ar~&#xD;
you so deeply disappointed at not seeing him at&#xD;
chapel all day yesterday, that you must go and&#xD;
make him a visit to-day ?"&#xD;
Whether Sina Elinton's guardian demon de.&#xD;
served her that night or not, I do not know.&#xD;
Certain it is, however, that she was not one to&#xD;
brook control, or bear disappointment. The&#xD;
time was not ripe, openly to defy Squire Darling,&#xD;
if indeed defiance would have served her turn at&#xD;
all. Be that as it might have been, at eight&#xD;
o'clock, Miss Hinton bade good-night to Squire&#xD;
Darling, and retired to her own room-not to&#xD;
stay, however; very soon she cautiously emerged&#xD;
from the chamber, and creeping stealthily down&#xD;
stairs, saddled a horse with her own hands, and&#xD;
left the house as before, unconscious of a dark&#xD;
figure on horse-back perseveringly dogging her&#xD;
course.&#xD;
The same luxurious chamber, the same hand-&#xD;
some occupant awaited our little villain; the&#xD;
only difference being that Colonel Dangerfield, in&#xD;
a gorgeous dressing-gownreclined in a large, easy&#xD;
chair, covered with gold colored satin, with his&#xD;
wounded foot resting upon a cushion.&#xD;
"My dear, brave, imprudent girl! I knew&#xD;
you would come! but why then not come in the&#xD;
day-time and 'with a proper escort ?"&#xD;
Sina explained, with luxuriant embellishments,&#xD;
the occurrences of the day.&#xD;
"My dear Sinai to what a tyranny yon are&#xD;
subjected. But take courage, Sinai As soon&#xD;
as I can get a boot on this cursed-I beg your&#xD;
pardon-I meant to say this crippled foot, I shall&#xD;
go over to Oak Grove, and paying Squire Dar-&#xD;
ling the respect due him as your guardian, little&#xD;
is he deserves it, I shall ask leave to visit you&#xD;
it his house, informing him of our engagement&#xD;
it the sa~ne time. I do trust, my dear love, that&#xD;
shall be able to come over to-morrow"&#xD;
&#xD;
SHANNOND ALE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Sina exerted all her powers of fascination that&#xD;
evening, and with unprecedented success; never&#xD;
was a rational man more thoroughly bewildered,&#xD;
a christian man more completely bed~ivllled than&#xD;
was Colonel Dangerfield when Sina left him that&#xD;
night. Look where he would, or shut his eyes&#xD;
if he pleased, the image of a fiery and intoxica-&#xD;
ting sprite in crimson satin, whose eyes were&#xD;
grappling hooks, whose ringlets were nets and&#xD;
meshes, caught and entangled him.&#xD;
In the meantime our little scamp pursued her&#xD;
way lame, where a warm welcome was await-&#xD;
ing her, of which by the way she was quite un-&#xD;
conscious.&#xD;
Squire Darling paced up and down the long&#xD;
area of his library, cursing the lameness that&#xD;
still prevented his mounting a horse. Now&#xD;
he stood with his back to the glowing hickory&#xD;
fire; now he walked to the window and looked&#xD;
out into the night; now he pulled the bell rope&#xD;
violently, unil the whole house resounded, and&#xD;
the whole grove echoed, bringing in a servant.&#xD;
"Has Achilles returned yet ?"&#xD;
"Curse him, he is very slow! Do you be on&#xD;
the watch for him, sir, and as soon as he comes,&#xD;
do you take charge of his horse yourself, and&#xD;
send him without the loss of a moment's time to&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"Yes, sir; anything else master I"&#xD;
" No, go l,~&#xD;
The man withdrew.&#xD;
"Satan snatch the fellow! what keeps him so&#xD;
long-nine-yes, by Jove, ten o'clock, and he&#xD;
not returned yet."&#xD;
He seized the bell rope and gave it another&#xD;
succession of violent jerks. The man immedi-&#xD;
ately re.entered.&#xD;
"More light here! My candle is sinking in&#xD;
its socket."&#xD;
"Yes, sir! Uncle Kill has come, Sir I I hear&#xD;
his horse's hoofs gallopping into the yard now."&#xD;
"Out of my sight then, in double quick time,&#xD;
and send him up here; let Aim bring the candies."&#xD;
C~Yes, sir," and the man withdrew.&#xD;
In a very few minutes Uncle Kill entered the&#xD;
room bearing the lights.&#xD;
"Ahi you have come! Set them on the&#xD;
chimney-piece! Now then-yo~i kept a watch&#xD;
over your young lady."&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
* "You followed her at a respectful distance-&#xD;
near enough to protect, yet not near enough to&#xD;
annoy her."&#xD;
"Yes, marster-no, marster-I means she&#xD;
never knowed nothing' 'bout my hem' on to her&#xD;
track!"&#xD;
"Be careful of your phraseology, sir I On Aer&#xD;
tresek! On J2vZiss.Hinton'e track-what insolence&#xD;
is that?" '&#xD;
&#xD;
119&#xD;
&#xD;
"I beg your and Miss Hinton's pardons sir; I&#xD;
meant to say how she never knowed as how she&#xD;
had a faithful sarvint behind her a keeping' df a&#xD;
watch over her for to keep off purl."&#xD;
"Very well! but now then, if it be in you at&#xD;
all to give a consecutive narrative, do it~"&#xD;
"Sari,,&#xD;
"If you can tell a straight story, confound&#xD;
you! tell it. Where and when did you first see&#xD;
Miss Hinton after ihe left the parlor 1"&#xD;
"Yes, sir! at the md door, sir I"&#xD;
"When-what hour ?"&#xD;
"At half-past eight o'clock, sir I"&#xD;
is "Yes, by the devil's dam, whose daughter she&#xD;
I,' muttered the squire, between his teeth,&#xD;
"that was the hour she took leave of me for the&#xD;
night, saying that she had already kept me up&#xD;
beyond my time, which was true, and that she&#xD;
would then go to bed herself, which was false.&#xD;
Well, sir! what then I"&#xD;
"You, see, roarster, how it wur very dark,&#xD;
and I was a-settin' underneath them there stone&#xD;
stairs as goes down from that there same md&#xD;
door, and every singly soul 'bout the plantation&#xD;
wur gone to bed, 'cept 'twur you, master, and&#xD;
me, and one other person. Last I heerd the&#xD;
door over 'hove my head open, and creak, and&#xD;
shet, and a soft pit pat, like a little cat's steps&#xD;
a comm' down the stairs; then I peeped out&#xD;
from underneath my bidin' place, an' I cotch my&#xD;
eye on to Miss Sina-least-wise, I mean- an' I&#xD;
swear to man, sar, it wur the Lord's blessed&#xD;
truffe-I seed in the black dark-and it wur so&#xD;
thick, black dark, you might leant up aginat the&#xD;
darkness and gone to sleep-the darkness walled&#xD;
you up all around; 'deed it seemed like it wur&#xD;
not possible to get through it without cutting&#xD;
your way through the solid darkness with a&#xD;

"The d-l, sir I go on wita your story I,,&#xD;
Ct Yes, sar-yes, master! well, in course, ~&#xD;
couldn't see Miss Sina, for there wasn't a singly&#xD;
star in the sky, but what I did see wur-and it&#xD;
is the blessed Lord's holy truffe-ker two e~'ev~&#xD;
large and shinin' like two stars near the earth,&#xD;
and moving along in the solid darkness like wolf's&#xD;
eyes, and that was all I could see of her!"&#xD;
"Be careful, you black rascal! mind yourself,&#xD;
sir, and know of whom you spesir I R'~flect,&#xD;
sir, that you were ordered to follow that eccen.&#xD;
tric young lady at a respectful distance for her&#xD;
protection," said the squire, almost vainly try.&#xD;
ing to reconcile his system of espionage with-the&#xD;
idea of perfect confidence in, and respect for his&#xD;
charge, with which he wished to impress his&#xD;
household. "Go on, sir."&#xD;
"Well, master, she, 1 mean the young lady,&#xD;
sir, Miss Sina Hinton p~sed on through the solid&#xD;
darkness without no light 'cept 'twur her bla-&#xD;

"Yes, sir! well, sir! I keeps a hind o' her all&#xD;

angrily exclaimed the squire, though it is to be&#xD;
presumed that if old Kill had made any disco-&#xD;
veries, the squire Would not have been averse to&#xD;
hearing them and profiting by his servant's&#xD;
eavesdropping. As it turned out a fruitless&#xD;
peeping, however, our squire could afford to in-&#xD;
dulge in a fit of virtuous indignation without loss.&#xD;

excusing himself.&#xD;

"Then, sir, I comed away, an' left her there,&#xD;

and smiled with scornful triumph.&#xD;
"Well! I told you, Sina, that you are dis-&#xD;
covered!"&#xD;
"To-be-what ?" demanded Miss Ilinton,&#xD;
deliberately&#xD;
"How cool you are to be sure !"&#xD;
"Yes, though 1 have not quaffed a quart of&#xD;
ice-water 1"&#xD;
"Do you understand that you are found&#xD;
out?"&#xD;
"To be what? as I asked before !"&#xD;
"You have been watched-traced to the Sol-&#xD;

Oh! no hurry. Life is long; a young man&#xD;

"Will you take a glass of ice-water to help&#xD;

Go to the deuce, ma'am, or explain your&#xD;

The blood rushed to Squire Darling's head-&#xD;
his throat swelled-his lace turned black--the&#xD;
veins started like cords-he trembled all over-&#xD;
he staggered, sank into a chair; the perspira-&#xD;
tion started, streamed from his face this save4&#xD;
Squire Darling from a stroke of apoplexy, I do&#xD;
believe. He tremblingly drew a handkerchief&#xD;
from his pocket, wiped his eyes again and again&#xD;
-heaved a profound nigh-drew a deep breath,&#xD;
and recovered himself.&#xD;
Sina was burning, blazing, sparkling, scintil-&#xD;
lating-mirth, scorn and defiance, in every glow&#xD;
of her crimson-draped figure, and every flash of&#xD;
her fierce and elfin features.&#xD;
"Au-audacious! un-unblushing girl!" gasp-&#xD;
ed the nearly suffocated squire.&#xD;
"Why should I blush I"&#xD;
"She-she glories in her shame 1"&#xD;
"In my innocence, and the perfect safety of&#xD;
my position, sir !"&#xD;
"The perfect safety of your position, you&#xD;
shameless-oh! my Lord! I do not wish ~o for-&#xD;
get that she is a woman!"&#xD;
"Ah, ha! now we are going to have re-&#xD;
hearsed another comedy of jealousy!"&#xD;
"Jealousy ! not so, my dear girl! Do not&#xD;
flatter yourself that I shall amuse you with any&#xD;
such food for satire, this evening-useless as ab-&#xD;
surd! No, Sina~ but you need to be looked after&#xD;
and taken care of."&#xD;
"Possibly you would recommend a strait-&#xD;
jacket, sir!"&#xD;
"Possibly I might, Miss Hinton-at all events&#xD;
you need to be controlled; and I must have a&#xD;
better right than now I have, to control you.&#xD;
And now, this night, Sina, and before you leave&#xD;
this room, we must come to a down-right under-&#xD;
standing."&#xD;
Her tone changed. She left off her flippant,&#xD;
half-scornful manner of replying, and seating&#xD;
herself composedly, she said,&#xD;
"!es-it is as well thht before I leave the&#xD;
room, we do come to a distinct and final under-&#xD;
standing; pray proceed, sir."&#xD;
"Then, Miss Hiuton, are you ready to give,&#xD;
me your hand to-morrow ?"&#xD;
"No, sir !"&#xD;
"When then?"&#xD;
" P1 ever, sir I"&#xD;
"Never !"&#xD;
'Most assuredly, never !"&#xD;
"Ha! we'll see! pray why ?"&#xD;
"Because, sir, I have promised the said sallow.&#xD;
little digit to Colonel Dangerfield I"&#xD;
"The d-l! no! that can't be! I swear it&#xD;
is a falsehood! I beg your pardon-I mean a&#xD;
mistake I"&#xD;
"Colonel Dangerfield will call on you to-mor.-&#xD;
row, sir, in your capacity of my sort-of-guar-&#xD;
dian!"&#xD;
&#xD;
123&#xD;
&#xD;
"It's not so! what! Dangerfield! he! so&#xD;
Aaughty!"&#xD;
"Exactly, sir! so haughty, that he defies the&#xD;
commentaries of his neighbors, and dares to&#xD;
please himself in the choice of a wife. even when&#xD;
that choice rests on a penniless girl like me I"&#xD;
"Here's a dell of a tuss! Oh! it's all an&#xD;
imposition! It can't be so! Wtiat'i~ more, ±t&#xD;
shan't be so! by heaven shan't it! What! Dan-&#xD;
gerfield! he is betrothed to Imogene !"&#xD;
"She has discarded him, sir, or set him free,&#xD;
which amounts to the same thing !"&#xD;
"The d-l! I knew you were trying to en-&#xD;
trap him. I knew you were flirting desperately&#xD;
with him-but I knew that you w~re too selfish,&#xD;
cold and fierce, to come to any harm; and I&#xD;
never Ireamed that he would wish to marry&#xD;
you?"&#xD;
"Thank you, sir !"&#xD;
"Sins! he shall not have you! By the blood&#xD;
of Beelzebub! he shall not have you to save his,&#xD;
to save your own life I"&#xD;
Miss Hint~n smiled contemptuously&#xD;
"And what is more, I will have you myself!&#xD;
I've used persuasion, entreaty, long enough;&#xD;
now I'll try something else-for, though all tue&#xD;
power of heaven, and the ingenuity of earth, and&#xD;
the malignity of hell, were league to prevent&#xD;
~t, I will have you!"&#xD;
Miss ilinton laughed scornfully.&#xD;
"Why don't you answer me, girl ?"&#xD;
"Because you rave-and it is folly to reply to&#xD;
raving. How on earth, I should be glad to know,&#xD;
are you to prevent my marrying whom I&#xD;
please ?"&#xD;
"How? i'll go to him, and say that I have&#xD;
been this girl's lover for two years-during the&#xD;
whole of which time she has lived with me !"&#xD;
Miss Hinton raised her splendid eyes, blazing&#xD;
with defiance, to his.&#xD;
"And if you do, sir! you will but endorse&#xD;
what I have told him myself! You will but give&#xD;
him a new motive for hastening our marriage,&#xD;
that I may be the more speedily released from&#xD;
this persecution!'&#xD;
"By heaven, then! he shall not have you!&#xD;
What! you that I have had in my sight for two&#xD;
years-you that I have been habituated to be-&#xD;
lieve my own-you that I have adored-when&#xD;
I have looked forward even to long future&#xD;
years-"&#xD;
"Of gout and plethora, and being nursed-an&#xD;
enchanting prospect for me, sir! I always looked&#xD;
upon you as a father, Squire Darling; and as a&#xD;
daughter, I would even nurse you in your old&#xD;
age aull infirmities !"&#xD;
"Confound daughters! old age! infirmity! in-&#xD;
deed; that is insulting! By heaven, Miss Hin-&#xD;
ton, you need not think of marrying that cursed&#xD;
whiskered fellow! He shall not have you to&#xD;
save his life, or your own. If the worst comes&#xD;
&#xD;
io the worst, I will go to hiut, and will say that&#xD;
which you may very readily guess, Miss Hintois&#xD;
and which will prevent his marrying you !,&#xD;
Now Siria turned deadly pale with fear. and&#xD;
rage. Her very lbs were white, and trembling&#xD;
as she said&#xD;
"You! a Virginian gentleman! a Darling!&#xD;
No! you will never do that !"&#xD;
"Will I not? Miss Hinton, I am the only one&#xD;
you can, in any sort of honor, marry. I love&#xD;
you-wish to marry you-will settle a fortune&#xD;
on you-will place you at once at the head of&#xD;
society in this neighborhood; but, Sina, if you&#xD;
persist in this fancy for my rival-,se help me&#xD;
heaven, I will go to Colonel Dangerfield, and&#xD;
whisper that in his ear which shall lead him to&#xD;
break withyou!"&#xD;
"You will not! no, you will not do that,"&#xD;
frantically exclaimed Sins..&#xD;
"Look in my face and see if I will not!"&#xD;
"Do IT, 5IR~ THEN !" ~t last, in fury, broke&#xD;
out Sina. "Do it! but do not hope that that&#xD;
perfidy will serve you! For, look you! 1 am a&#xD;
fiend incarnate! My mother's mistehiess wrongs!&#xD;
my own! have made me so! The only human&#xD;
feeling I have, is an affection for Dangerfield-&#xD;
an affection that shall not be wounded! shall&#xD;
not, under any contingency, while he only loves&#xD;
me! For, oh! listen man! that stan'ieth there&#xD;
talking of some weak counterfeitthsx thou call'st&#xD;
love! and mixing it up with carriages and&#xD;
horses, and houses, and marriage settlements!&#xD;
Listen! I love Dangerfield-he loves me! and&#xD;
neither your perfidy, his pride, nor my own soul's&#xD;
salvation, shall separate us! No I no! no! I&#xD;
will follow him! live with him! ilve for him! I&#xD;
had rather be Dangerfield's servant, his dog, than&#xD;
your wife, with all the emoluments of that honor-&#xD;
able office! and feeling, as I do, there were&#xD;
luas shame in it !" Her face worked, nay con-&#xD;
vulsed with the warring passions of anguish,&#xD;
despair, and rage! Strange, but the storm, the&#xD;
tornado raging in her bosom, attracted him&#xD;
powerfully ; he had been very pale-now his face&#xD;
flushed deeply; he stretched out his hand, caught&#xD;
her-strained, her, struggling, to his bosom-&#xD;
cleared her ringlets from her agonized face, and&#xD;
~half suffocated her with kisses, exclaiming be-&#xD;
tween them,&#xD;
"And I will tell him that tf&amp;amp;u.r I have had her&#xD;
in my arms-thws I have strained hem to my&#xD;
bosom!'&#xD;
"Bold !" said Sins, in a low, deep, stern, con-&#xD;
centrated tone of rage- "You hug yqur death-&#xD;
be warned! release me. or Iwill KILL YOU&#xD;
"1 lose my time," sneered he, resuming his&#xD;
caresses-and saying between them, "Ah! lit..&#xD;
tie kittens snarl and slit, but seldom bite like&#xD;
n',bler animals !"&#xD;
Iwill kill you !'&#xD;
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! so you threatened once&#xD;

Mrs. Sommerfeld explained-while she array-&#xD;
ed herself in her bonnet and shawl-that it was&#xD;
impossible for Nerve to bail her husband out of&#xD;
jail in the way proposed. Poor old Nerve open-&#xD;
&#xD;
ed wide her eyes at this, and replied with more&#xD;
indignation than we have ever seen her dii..&#xD;
play-&#xD;
"Not I-not let me pawn myself for my ole&#xD;
man! Well! I mm' say, as I never murmurs&#xD;
at anything my blessed Lord in heaven, or my&#xD;
pastors an' masters on the yeth thinks proper&#xD;

and very 'rannical, very!-when they let a rich&#xD;
person bail their frien' out'n jail with money-&#xD;
they won't let a poor person bail their out&#xD;
with all they* got--their poor ole body I" and&#xD;
dropping down at the front door, whch they&#xD;
had all now reached, the old woman rolled on&#xD;
the marble pavement, giving herself up to sob-&#xD;
bing and groaning.&#xD;
Mrs. Summerfield stooped down and said,&#xD;
gently-&#xD;
"Nerve, do not cry. I will bail Achilles&#xD;
out-if it be possible. Don't cry. Get up, and&#xD;
ensue with me."&#xD;
Her kind words, and a glass or two of water,&#xD;
helped the poor old creature upon her feet, and&#xD;
she entered the carriage with Mrs. Summerfield.&#xD;
"Take care of your cousin, Imogene. If no-&#xD;
eessary, 1 will send the carriage back for beth&#xD;
~.f you, and in that case, you will know how to&#xD;
bring her without alarming her"&#xD;
It was not until they hat! ridden some way,&#xD;
that Mrs. Summerfield could draw from Nerve&#xD;
anything like a connected statement of what had&#xD;
~efallen. At last, however, she said-&#xD;
"Why, you see, Miss Mar'get, honey, las'&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVII&#xD;
THE TRIAL.&#xD;
Let the prisoner be placed at the bar&#xD;
Legal Form of lntvitatiois.&#xD;
I'll see, before I doubt; when I doubt prove;&#xD;
And on the proof there is no more but this-&#xD;
Away at once with love and jealousy.&#xD;
Shakspeare.&#xD;
£here was quite a crowd of people assembled&#xD;
at Oak Grove. There is nothing, neither wed-&#xD;
ding, christening, nor funeral, for bringing people&#xD;
together like a catastrophe, particularly if there&#xD;
is a mystery in it. On seeing the state of Squire&#xD;
Darling, Mrs. Summerfield had thought proper to&#xD;
send, first for Miss Summerfield, old Mrs. Dar-&#xD;
ling, and Mrs. Ardenne, from Red-Stone iall.&#xD;
These three ladles had arrived, accompanied by&#xD;
Harriet Joy, who was always ready to offer her&#xD;
assistance in every species of distress. Next&#xD;
she had sent for Colonel Dangerfield, in his capa-&#xD;
city of magistrate, and lastly, for Father Bun-&#xD;
leigh, to be on the spot "in case"-to quote the&#xD;
vague language used to prefigure an expected&#xD;
dissolution-" in Case anything should happen"&#xD;
Squire Darling's wounds had been dressed, and&#xD;
be lay upon his bed flat on his back, perfectly&#xD;
motionless, his eyes half open, but "lacking&#xD;
speculation," his lips blue and glutinous, his skin&#xD;
of that gray paleness, which is usually the&#xD;
gathering shades of death. Winny, weak and&#xD;
pale, sat by her father's bed, her "numbed"&#xD;
affections slowly reviving at the piteous sight.&#xD;
Sina Hinton, in the opposite wing of the build-&#xD;
ing, lay tossing and tumbling, or violently strtg-&#xD;
~liog, and filling the air with her maniac '-'reams.&#xD;
Rettie Smihe and her father, who had come over&#xD;

at the first news of the calamity, had as much a&#xD;
they could do to hold her down during one of he&#xD;
paroxyams of frenzy. She was possessed wit&#xD;
the idea that she had murdered Squire Darline&#xD;
and was about to be led to the scaffold for th&#xD;
crime; all her desperate shrieks and violent&#xD;
struggles were to escape the visionary exeen&#xD;
toner. There could be no greater trial to th&#xD;
good little landlord and his tenderhearted daugh&#xD;
ter, than to witness this agony of frenzy. Poo:&#xD;
little Sammie Smilie she always took for thi&#xD;
execurioer, and would shriek horribly when h4&#xD;
Would approach to hold her, to prevent he:&#xD;
throwing herself upon the floor, or dashing he:&#xD;
head against the wall. This hurt his feeling&#xD;
more than anything~&#xD;
"Me a hangman- the Lore save ncr soul&#xD;
Me! as allus goes out ofsight and hearing when&#xD;
ever they kilt a chicken for dinner. Do I loal&#xD;
like a Jack Ketch, 1 asks any candid soul ?" the&#xD;
little fellow would say, sitting down, puffing and&#xD;
blowing and panting, and wiping his innocent,&#xD;
round face with his speckled, yellow handker.&#xD;
chief. "Hettie, do I look cruel, honey ?"&#xD;
"No indeed, father! you look just like what&#xD;
you are, the very best man in the whole world,&#xD;
I don't care who the others may be, even if they&#xD;
ave priests, or presidents--don't mind what she&#xD;
says. father-she is raving mad ~&#xD;
These conversations would occur after Sina,&#xD;
with her violent struggles and shrieks, had quite&#xD;
worn out her strength, and lay in a state of tem-&#xD;
porary quietude from exhaustion. And it was&#xD;
singular that no one noticed her raving, or at-&#xD;
tacted any suspicion to her from the fact of her&#xD;
selfaccusation. What motive in fact could Miss&#xD;
Hinton be supposed to have for deadly enmity to&#xD;
Squire Darling? On the contrary, every one&#xD;
supposed them to be on terms of the most per-&#xD;
fect conflden~e and cordiality There was one&#xD;
indeed who grew pale and stern suddenly, when&#xD;
he would hear of Miss Hiuton's "maniac fan.&#xD;
cies"-Colonel Dungerfield He had, it is true,&#xD;
upon the strength of the strong, and but for one&#xD;
fact known only to Colonel Dangerfield himself,&#xD;
overwhelming circumstantial evidence, incarcera-&#xD;
ted poor old Kill, but he dared not trust his own&#xD;
greatly biased judgment with the onus of com-&#xD;
mitting him for trial-he preferred being assisted&#xD;
by the cool heads and unburdened hearts of two&#xD;
ref his brother magistrates. Old Kill had been&#xD;
confined-not in jail yet, as poor Nerve and his&#xD;
fellow-servants for his better security had been&#xD;
led to suppose-but in a distant chamber in the&#xD;
house, there to await the arrival of the other&#xD;
magistrates.&#xD;
They came about noon. One a stern, severe&#xD;
looking man; tall, lean, dark, bilious, exceed-&#xD;
ingly given to ferreting out incipient insurrec-&#xD;
tions; his whole grave and still deportment cx-&#xD;

Lt ducted in the parlor. The three magistrates&#xD;
occupied seats at one end of ~he room. "1. Rock,&#xD;
e Esq.," occupying the centre chair. and flanked&#xD;
-, on the right by the pretty little Mr. Lovejoy,&#xD;
r and on the left by the stern and sad Colonel&#xD;
B Dangerfield. A long table was before them, at&#xD;
a one end of which sat a clerk, with pen, ink and&#xD;
r paper before him. The family and visitors then&#xD;
in the house were requested to be present at the&#xD;
examination. And indeed by this time the house&#xD;
swarmed with all sorts of people. The servants,&#xD;
I with frightened looks and whispering tones, were&#xD;
collected in the passage ways.&#xD;
Presently poor old Kill was led, or rather drag.&#xD;
I ged in, half dead with terror, and between two&#xD;
constables. He was the perfect ideal of abject&#xD;
guilt. His looks would have been evidence&#xD;
enough to any jury to bring in a verdict of&#xD;
GUILTY. Yes, his face then would have hanged&#xD;
him. He was followed by old Nerve, weeping&#xD;
bitterly, and goaded in by a man with a stick,&#xD;
walking behind her. Kill was placed before his&#xD;
judges, and then Nerve threw herself on his&#xD;
neck weeping and hugging, and hugging ~nd&#xD;
weeping; while between sobs and gasps she en.&#xD;
hosted him as follows-&#xD;
"Oh I Killus, honey I 'fess, chile! 'less! tell&#xD;

poor old Kill.&#xD;
"Order, in the court !" thundered dark Mr.&#xD;
Rock.&#xD;
"Yes, master! yes! I will order in the court,&#xD;

The old man bowed himself from the room. Vellemonte here."&#xD;
As he glided along the darkened and silent pa.- The old man hurried to tho stables once&#xD;

SHANNC&#xD;
again, saddled the best blood in the stalls, and&#xD;
l~astened to Sacred Heart. He returned in two&#xD;
hours, attending Mr. Vellemonte. The young&#xD;
priest passed immediately into the chamber of&#xD;
the dying maniac. I suppose some would say&#xD;
it ~sas mesmerism, some mere mannerism, while&#xD;
others, with a better faith, would define it to be&#xD;
the po~ erof religionthat enabled the young priest&#xD;
to compose the raving girl, who, settling into her&#xD;
last repose, lost that agonized contraction of the&#xD;
features that had, since her illness, marked her&#xD;
countenance even in its moments of exhaustion.&#xD;
One hour after this Sina Hinton died.&#xD;
Her funeral took place the third diy from that&#xD;
of her death. The event 'was broken gradually&#xD;
to Squire Darling; who, nevertheless, suffered&#xD;
a severe relapse. It was a fortnight before the&#xD;
convalescence of the squire permitted his rela.&#xD;
tives to return to their home-taking With them&#xD;
Winny, whose feeb.lenrss required the~ constant&#xD;
attentions of her aunt and cousin.&#xD;

The deeply tragic events at Oak Grove had so&#xD;
shattered the nerves of the good old pastor of&#xD;
Sacred Heart, that he now lay stretched pros-&#xD;
trate on his humble bed at the cottage parsonage.&#xD;
Miss Mattie Smilie, Harriette Joy, and the young&#xD;
curate, Claude Vellemonte, vied in their atten-&#xD;
tions upon him. But the influence of the young&#xD;
curate was as heretofore the most healthful. His&#xD;
took and tone and touch were as usual life-in.&#xD;
spring.&#xD;
"I don't know what snakes me feel so," said&#xD;
Miss Mattie Smilie, as she tsusied herself setting&#xD;
out "bulbouses" in the garden; "butsomehow or&#xD;
other good and great as he is, it does feel to me&#xD;
as if Mr. Vellemonte oughten't for to be a&#xD;
priest I"&#xD;
Why?" asked Harry' Joy, "I want you to&#xD;
tell me why, because I have often had that&#xD;
thought myself?"&#xD;
"Why, it feels to me as if he were too full of&#xD;
life."&#xD;
"Levity 2"&#xD;
"Levity 2-what's tbat 2"&#xD;
"Why flippancy-lightness of conduct-a-a&#xD;
gayety-joyousnessl"&#xD;
"N-no~---not-thatbut too fullof LiFE-that's&#xD;

deed felt every one even while worshipping their&#xD;
gifted young curate.&#xD;
I have spoken before of the half suppressed&#xD;
joyousness of heart that was the very illumina-&#xD;
tion of his highly vitalized beauty, and of thaL&#xD;
power springing from perfect healthfulness of&#xD;
body, mind, and spirit-rising above circum-&#xD;
stacces, and making glad every gloomy scene,&#xD;
bright every dark scene; magnetizing the sick&#xD;
with health; inspiring the septic with faith&#xD;
raising the responding by hope; softening the&#xD;
hardened, and redeeming the reprobate sinner by&#xD;
love! Jt was in the fullness of this power that&#xD;
Claude Vellernonte sat by the bed of Father Bur-&#xD;
leigh on the afternoon of the Sunday next pre-&#xD;
ceding Easter. He had composed his patient&#xD;
into a refreshing sleep. He had slept many&#xD;
hours, and still Claude Vellemonte retained his&#xD;
seat by the bed watching him steadily. At any&#xD;
sign of restlessness Claude would quietly slip&#xD;
his arm under the aged head, raise it tenderly,&#xD;
change the pillow, let the weary head down&#xD;
easily again, draw out his arm, and smoothing&#xD;
back the thin gray locks from the sunken tem-&#xD;
ples, decompose him to sleep. If again he stir-&#xD;
red, a few pauses of the cool hand over his brow&#xD;
and temples stilled him into deep repose-so his&#xD;
rest was protracted for many hours. At last&#xD;
Claude Vellemonte knowing that he had slept&#xD;
long enough suffered him to awake. The yorrng&#xD;
man sponged his hands and face with cold water&#xD;
and ~ologne, and gave him a glass of barley&#xD;
water flavored with lemon-juice. Then he&#xD;
changed his pillows and resumed his seat by his&#xD;
side with cheerfulness.&#xD;
"Claude," began the old priest.&#xD;
C~ My father!" answered the young man.&#xD;
"My son in years-my father 1 had almost&#xD;
said in wisdom and in grace I-~ bless ne for 1&#xD;
have sinned.'"&#xD;
"May God the Father, God the Son, and God&#xD;
the Holy Ghost bless thee, my father!"&#xD;
"Son, I have somewhat to say to thee I"&#xD;
"Speak, father, I listen"&#xD;
"Draw the curtain, shut out the light, close&#xD;
the door, for it is a long and dark story I have to&#xD;
tell thee, my son I"&#xD;
Claude Vellemonte did as requested and re-&#xD;
sumed his seat at the bedside of the invalid. He&#xD;
took one of the old wasted hands within his own&#xD;
and held it while the old priest gained strength&#xD;
to tell his story.&#xD;
"Claude, did it never occur to you that I had&#xD;
a life-long sorrow and remorse 2"&#xD;
"I have seen it, father, and hoped for the day&#xD;
when you would confide in me and share your&#xD;
burthen with me-to-night, I thank God, that&#xD;
you have strength to do so-I listen."&#xD;
And he pressed the thin hand, and his young&#xD;
strong life seemed to send energy through all the&#xD;
feeble nerves of the invalid. The old priest com.&#xD;
menced his story.&#xD;

Tif E SECRET UJIIME.&#xD;
Claude Vdlemontei I was early left an orphan&#xD;
with my ti~in sister. We were placed by the&#xD;
executor of our father's will in the same Mo-&#xD;
nastic school for education-she in the female&#xD;
department-i in the male. We were then fif-&#xD;
teen years of age. 1 admired that sister of mine&#xD;
with an enthusiasm that no words can describe!&#xD;
I loved her with a strength and devotion to&#xD;
which no words can do justice. She was my&#xD;
sole thought in the present, my sole object in&#xD;
the future I She was my love, my religion, my&#xD;
idolatry! If I had an ambition for wealth, rank,&#xD;
power, or fame, it was that she might be crown-&#xD;
ed with glory! The strict rule of the seminary&#xD;
in which we were placed forbade our meeting.&#xD;
The boys and the girls, or it would now be term.&#xD;
ed, the young gentlemen's and the young ladies'&#xD;
department had not even a chapel in common,&#xD;
but each had its separate place of worship and&#xD;
its distinct pastor. Once a month, however, I&#xD;
was permitted to see my sister for half an hour&#xD;
in the ladies' parlor, In the presence of one of the&#xD;
siBterhood. These, restricted as our intercourse&#xD;
was, were the very brightest moments of my&#xD;
sebool days. Veronica was beautiful! Brothers&#xD;
do not generally see their sister's beauty, but 1&#xD;
felt Veronica's extreme loveliness in my heart of&#xD;
hearts. I could see in every succeeding visit J&#xD;
paid her, a ne~ unfolding of beauty-some new&#xD;
fresh leaf of the sweet bud blooming forth I&#xD;
How I longed for the time to come when we&#xD;
should be of age-be emancipated from school&#xD;
life, and when I should take her home and have&#xD;
her with me forever. Then as I watched her&#xD;
growing into such woliderful beauty; I would&#xD;
think that even then some rurin would see and&#xD;
love her, would win her deepest love and wile&#xD;
her fioun me, and a pang of jealousy would dart&#xD;
through my heart. I strove with this feeling-&#xD;
I partly conquered it. I grew to look upon Ve-&#xD;
ronica's future marriage as a certainty, and ac-&#xD;
customed myself to think of passing my life in&#xD;
her home as the bachelor brother and uncle-&#xD;
and of making her children my heirs. And yet&#xD;
I was very much discontented with this prospect,&#xD;
and sighed for the past days when we had been&#xD;
the whole world to each other. Yes I I dreaded&#xD;
now the longed desired emancipation from school&#xD;
-.1 dreaded it as the greatest misfortune that&#xD;
threatened us.&#xD;
Evil.' that we dread seldom happen to tea.&#xD;
Years passed slowly enough over our heads-&#xD;
and every successive yeilr Veronica matured in&#xD;
beauty, and I loved her with a deeper devotion.&#xD;
But another change besides maturing of her&#xD;
loveliness, was coming on her. She grew-not&#xD;
cold to me, but-indiffirene to me, I bad almost&#xD;
said uacsrnscious of me. Her beauty was get-&#xD;
ting a devotional character. Her expression be-&#xD;
casseelevated, rapt, inspired. She was growing&#xD;
to resemble some pictures of the Virgin Mery. I&#xD;
&#xD;
ON DALE.&#xD;
sometimes thought her high style of countenance&#xD;
inadvertently caught, as it were, from the inces-&#xD;
sant contemplation of some beatified saint's or&#xD;
virgin's image. My soul felt darkened and chill-&#xD;
ed as though she had withdrawn her light and&#xD;
warmth from me, and was breathing it incense&#xD;
like to heaven. The time approached fur our&#xD;
leaving school, which was the period also at&#xD;
which our guardian would surrender up to us our&#xD;
patrimony, and we should establish ourselves in&#xD;
the world. I was totally unprepared for what&#xD;
happened next. Upon the day we were to have&#xD;
left the seminary we assembled in the ladies&#xD;
parlor in the presence of the Lady Superior, the&#xD;
Chaplain of the institution, our guardian, and an&#xD;
attorney. There we were to be put in posses.&#xD;
sion f the title deeds of our patrimony, before&#xD;
taking leave of our many years' abode. It was&#xD;
there that I received from the lips of the Lady&#xD;
Superior the information that say sister had de-&#xD;
termined to take the veil! I could not, I would&#xD;
not believe it I I appealed to Veronica herself.&#xD;
* She confirmed the report of the Lady Superior.&#xD;
Her answer was conclusive. I was overwhelmed&#xD;
with affliction. I would not give her up. I said&#xD;
and did everything I could think of that might&#xD;
affect her resolution! In vain! I used argu-&#xD;
ment, persuasion, entreaties, tears! To no pur-&#xD;
pose! but it seemed,-to fix her determination&#xD;
more firmly! Let me do others justice also.&#xD;
The Lady Superior, the sisters, the Chaplain, all&#xD;
thinking perhaps that her ignorance of life in the&#xD;
world, and her serene life in the convent might&#xD;
have unduly biased her inclinations, had tried to&#xD;
prevail on her at least to delay her purpose for a&#xD;
few years-to go out and see the world she pro-&#xD;
posed to abandon before giving it up forever.&#xD;
They wished, in fact, to take no unfair adv3n-&#xD;
tage of her ignorance and inexperience. The&#xD;
arguments and persuasions satisfied their own&#xD;
ideal of strict justice, but had no sort of effect&#xD;
upon Veronica's resolution unless, as mine did,&#xD;
they confirmed her determination. She was in-&#xD;
fatuated-mad-as the sequel proved. Nearly&#xD;
frantic with grief I took my leave of Veronica&#xD;
the same day. Our Chaplain consoled me. He&#xD;
assured me again that every possible delay&#xD;
should be made, while every means was used to&#xD;
test the sincerity of my sister-that there was&#xD;
little doubt that she, like many others, would&#xD;
reconsider her resolution- that very few were&#xD;
the "called, chosen, and faithful" brides of hea-&#xD;
ven. Again let me be just to the convent. Every&#xD;
means were in fact used to test the strength of&#xD;
my sister's resolution, but only with the effect&#xD;
of settling her more firmly in it. Never was a&#xD;
new postulant admitted with more caution, for&#xD;
all seemed to feel her step premature and ,ll con-&#xD;
sidered. She was kept two years in the convent&#xD;
as postulant before being permitted to enter upon&#xD;
her noviciate.&#xD;

sited Veronica lt was such a mockery then to&#xD;
see her face within a grate, and her form swath-&#xD;
ed in the shroud-like white bands, and draped&#xD;
with the white mantle and veil of the order.-&#xD;
Twelve months from h~r entering upon her novi-&#xD;
elate, she took the black veil. Let me recall the&#xD;
day of her&#xD;
TAKING THE BLACK VEIL.&#xD;
The Ritual of the assumption by a novice of&#xD;
the Black Veil, that is to hide forever, the&#xD;
world from her eyes-the pall that is to cover&#xD;
forever the brow of the living dead,-is, Jet me&#xD;
tell you, if you have never seen the august and&#xD;
solemn ceremony-much more profoundly im-&#xD;
posing than that of the initiation of a mere pos-&#xD;
tulant by the reception of the white veil.&#xD;
For weeks before the important day arrived, a&#xD;
xumbr of a novice being about to take the black&#xD;
veil, went all over town and country. The awful&#xD;
ceremony was, even then, so rare in this country,&#xD;
that an immense crowd gathered, and from the&#xD;
earliest hour of its being opened, the chapel was&#xD;
crowded. I repaired to the chapel slowly and&#xD;
with a dying heart. I arrived late, and finding&#xD;
no seat, was forced to take a stand in one of the&#xD;
aisles near the altar. It was a beautiful, gor-&#xD;
geous and solemn autumn day-the warm, still,&#xD;
sun rays, poured richly through the stained glass&#xD;
of the gothic Windows, flooding the church with&#xD;
glorious, though mellowed light. Amid the&#xD;
great crowd, an awful silence reigned-an awful&#xD;
stillness, too, moved only by the quivering of the&#xD;
gorgeous, many colored sun rays.&#xD;
Presently, as before, the door on the right&#xD;
hand of the altar noiselessly swung open, and a&#xD;
train of sacristans in robes, entered, preceding&#xD;
the bishop, priests and deacons, in their canoni-&#xD;
eels, and followed by the holy brotherhood in&#xD;
long procession, and took their places within,&#xD;
before, and about the altar,-the bishop occupy-&#xD;
ing the centre.&#xD;
The door on the left now swung noiselessly&#xD;
* open, and a procession of the holy sisterhood en-&#xD;
.tered, preceded by a cross-bearer, while the&#xD;
.e~ioir chanted as before-" Veni Creator."-&#xD;
* '1'hey ranged themselves quietly and solemnly,&#xD;
before the'altar&#xD;
1.'he novice approached from among them, and&#xD;
lcnelt before the altar. The act of profession,&#xD;
* with pen and ink, lay near her. The bishop now&#xD;
intoned from the altar, the solemn 'lEmitte Spi-&#xD;
uitum tuum," &amp;amp;c., "Send forth thy spirit and&#xD;
- they shall be created?' while the novice re-&#xD;
&#xD;
) NPALE.&#xD;
sponded, "And thou shalt renew the face of the&#xD;
earth."&#xD;
Then followed a prayer by the bishop, at the&#xD;
close of which he blessed the black veil, that&#xD;
lay near the altar. Then a chant was intoned&#xD;
alternately by the bishop and the candidate be-&#xD;
fore him. Next a prayer, at the end of which,&#xD;
the bishop sprinkled the black veil with holy&#xD;
water, and in the name of the Blessed Trinity,&#xD;
at the close of which rite, the gospel for the oc&#xD;
casion, was chanted by one of the officiating&#xD;
deacons. The Lady Superior and the Sub-Priox.&#xD;
ess, then led the novice to the grate, where she&#xD;
was interrogated as follows, by the bishop&#xD;
within.&#xD;
"My child, what do you demand I"&#xD;
"My father, I most humbly beg, that I may&#xD;
be received to the holy profession."&#xD;
"My child, do you consider yourself suffi.&#xD;
cienti, instructed in what regsrds the vows of&#xD;
rIigion and the rules and constitutions of this&#xD;
institute? And do you know the obligations&#xD;
~ ou contract by the holy profession ?"&#xD;
"Yes, my father, by the grace of God."&#xD;
"May God grant you perseverance in your&#xD;
holy resolution and may He deign in His mercy&#xD;
to consummate what He has begun. In the name&#xD;
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy&#xD;
Ghost. Ame~~~&#xD;
After this the organ pealed forth its rich tones,&#xD;
at regular intervals, announcing the solemn Mass&#xD;
of the HolyGhost. During all this time the novice&#xD;
continued kneeling before the altar-the Lady&#xD;
Superior on her right, the Sub-Prioress on the&#xD;
lett. At the end of the Mass, several prayers&#xD;
were offered up, several psalms chanted, and&#xD;
then the Sub-Prioress,-- taking the lighted taper&#xD;
from the hands of the novice, laid the act of&#xD;
profession b4ore her. She arose, took It up,&#xD;
approached the grate, and holding it in her hartd,&#xD;
chanted the "vota mea Domini," &amp;amp;c.;-"l will&#xD;
pay my vows unto the Lord, in the sight of&#xD;
all His people, in the courts of the house of the&#xD;
Lord I" Then kneeling again, the Comfiteer&#xD;
was said, after which, the bishop pronouncing&#xD;
the "Domine non sum dignus," &amp;amp;c ;-" Lord, I&#xD;
a~n not worthy that Thou shouldat come under&#xD;
my roof," approached the grate bearing the&#xD;
Holy Eucharist, which he held before her while&#xD;
she thus pronounced her vows-reading-&#xD;
"In the name of our Lord and' Saviour, Jesus&#xD;

Then writing her name, and making the sign&#xD;
of the cross after it with the pen, she passed the&#xD;
deed to the Lady Superior, who knelt at her&#xD;
right and.&#xD;
The most interesting-the most awful moment&#xD;
of the august ceremonial had now come-the&#xD;
moment when, having pledged herself to her di-&#xD;
vine spouse, she was to receive, in return, his&#xD;
pledge and earnest of mystical union; that in-&#xD;
stant was arrived, when the bishop, repeating&#xD;
tue following words, administered to her the&#xD;
Holy Euchariet,-'. What God has. commenced in&#xD;
thee, may He Himself perfect, and may our&#xD;
Lord Jesus Christ preserve thy soul unto life&#xD;
everlasting. Amen."&#xD;
Turning from the grate, and kneeling to the&#xD;
Lady Superior, Veronica received from her hand&#xD;
the consecrated ring, while the whole choir rang&#xD;
out again in the "Veni Spousa Christi ;"-&#xD;
"Come, Spouse of Christ." Veronica then sang&#xD;
with solemn and touching effect-" Suscipe me,&#xD;
Domine," three times, in honor of the Blessed&#xD;
Trinity. Then kneeling, she received the Black&#xD;
Veil from the Lunhop, who said, while placing it&#xD;
on her head-&#xD;
"Receive the holy veil, the emblem of chas-&#xD;
tity and modesty, which mayest thou carry be-&#xD;
fore the judgment seat of our Lord Jesus Christ,&#xD;
that thou mayest have eternal life. Amen."&#xD;
Then rising from her knees, and standing up,&#xD;
* holding her lighted taper, the newly professed&#xD;
nun sang the "Posuit Signum ;"-" He has&#xD;
placed Hi-s seal upon my forehead," &amp;amp;c. Then&#xD;
followed the august rite of the bishop's benedic-&#xD;
tion from the altar-responded to in every&#xD;
clause by the now kneeling nun. Then was&#xD;
chanted the "Itegnum Mundi," at the end of&#xD;
which Veronica prostrated herself, and while&#xD;
thut; lying metaphorically dead, the glorious&#xD;
'*Te Deum" arose from the whole Holy Brother.&#xD;
hood and Sisterhood, in full choir.&#xD;

CHAPTER XL.&#xD;
THE SECRET CRIME CONTINUED.&#xD;
Ah! wretch believed the spouse of God in vain,&#xD;
Confessed within the slave of love and man&#xD;
.Pope.&#xD;
I was ill for a long time after that ceremony.&#xD;
Whefti I recovered, the world had lost its chatms,&#xD;
if indeed it had ever possessed any for me. I&#xD;
resolved to follow the example of my sister. I&#xD;
determined to enter the priesthood. I re entered&#xD;
my college, and commenced a course of theolo-&#xD;
gical reading the same year. I became interest-&#xD;
ed in my studies- strongly attracted to my&#xD;
chosen vocation. I grew to think that I was&#xD;
called to it. I think so still. I grew quiet-&#xD;
then~ cheerful. In due course of time I was ap-&#xD;
pointed to this same ministry. Here I made&#xD;
many friends, found congenial pursuits, and was&#xD;
very happy in my calling, until one day, when I&#xD;
received a letter from the Reverend Lady Supe-&#xD;
nor of the Carmelite Convent, of which Veronica&#xD;
was professed sister. Imagine the overwhelming&#xD;
sorrow with which I learned that my sister had&#xD;
fled her convent, abjured her religion, and mar-&#xD;
ried! Bowed to the earth with grief and hnmi-&#xD;
liation, without saying one word to any one as&#xD;
to the cause of my journey, I suddenly left this&#xD;
neighborhood and repaired to the convent, to&#xD;
learn there the particulars of the flight. All&#xD;
that the Abbess had written was confirmed, and&#xD;
more was told me. Veronica had fled, and the&#xD;
companion of her flight was a handsome, gay,&#xD;
and fascinating man, of high rank, and of irre-&#xD;
proachable reputation certainly-whom, by the&#xD;
way, I had sometimes seen in my father's house,&#xD;
and who, the last year of our stay at home,&#xD;
when Veronica was about fifteen years of age,&#xD;
had paid the beautiful child rather marked atten-&#xD;
tion. How he found access to her again, how&#xD;
he contrived to wile her away, no one knew.&#xD;
They were married by special license at one of&#xD;
the Protestant Churches. He had forced the&#xD;
sisterhood to give up, or perhaps they had volun-&#xD;
tarily yielded the considerable property she had&#xD;
brought to the institution. I learned that he&#xD;
had taken her home to a small farm in one of the&#xD;
lower counties of Marl land, that formed an item&#xD;
of her property, and where they were now living.&#xD;
I was deeply grieved, but this marriage was be..&#xD;
yond remedy, of course. I returned in deep&#xD;
mortification to my pastoral charge. I wrote&#xD;
many letters to my sister, exhorting her, with&#xD;
every argument and persuasion in my power, at&#xD;
least to return to the bosom of the mother&#xD;
&#xD;

church. I wasted a great deal of controversial&#xD;
theology upon her, to little or no effect. I never&#xD;
received an answer; I doubt whether she ever&#xD;
got my letters; I have much reason to believe&#xD;
they were intercepted by her husband. Finally,&#xD;
in despair of ever receiving a response, I ceased&#xD;
to write to her. Years passed. And then,&#xD;
thinking that time might have brought some&#xD;
change favorable to a free communication be-&#xD;
tween us, I wrote to her again, but received no&#xD;
answer. A second time I ceased to importune&#xD;
her with letters. Several years elapsed, and&#xD;
then came a yearning of the heart for the com-&#xD;
panion of my childhood, that obliged me to set&#xD;
out on the long, rough, country journey, to visit&#xD;
her. I travelled on horseback, and it took me&#xD;
six days to reach the mouth of the Patuvent,&#xD;
where her farm lay. I arrived at nightfall, find-&#xD;
ing there the aged overseer, who had always&#xD;
farmed the land or my father during his life-&#xD;
time. The old man, with his aged wife, now&#xD;
occupied the farm-house. He invited me into&#xD;
the large, old-fashioned parlor, where his wf~i&#xD;
received me -~ ith much cordiality. He took my&#xD;
hat and gloves, laid them aside, gave me the&#xD;
easiest attn-chair in the cosiest corner of the&#xD;
ample fireplace, and set a little etand, with a&#xD;
pitcher of cider and a tumbler, by my side.&#xD;
Then requesting his old wife to hurry supper, he&#xD;
drew the other great arm chair to the opposite&#xD;
corner of the chimney, and sitting down pre-&#xD;
pared to entertain me if I were inclined to con-&#xD;
versation. I lost no time in inquiring after my&#xD;
sister and brother-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Joy. He&#xD;
gave me the following facts, which I shall, for&#xD;
convenience sake, put into my own words.&#xD;
When Frank Joy first brought his bride home&#xD;
he furnished the house with much taste and ele-&#xD;
gance. Her mother's and her father's old friends&#xD;
-~the most exclusive of the county aristocracy1&#xD;
flocked around them -the story of her elope-&#xD;
ment from a convent had preceded them, but in&#xD;
that Protestant neighborhood, onJy made the&#xD;
beautiful bride more an object of interest and&#xD;
~iriosity Great attention was shown them, es-&#xD;
pecially as her family was one of the oldest and&#xD;
most extensively connected in the county. On&#xD;
their pats also, the rites of hospitality were&#xD;
munificeritly dispensed. A series of elegant&#xD;
little dinner parties, and very select petits coverss&#xD;
were given by them. These were more rcchirche' I&#xD;
than the entertainments of the neighborhood&#xD;
usually were. They were greatly admired, as&#xD;
also were the accomplished host and beautiful&#xD;
hostess This was, or seemed, a very charming&#xD;
change to the simple recluse, who now found&#xD;
herself a great. lady (on a small scale), the cen-&#xD;
tre of an admiring circle ot friends.&#xD;
A severe winter advanced upon them, how-&#xD;
ever; the snow was Iwo feet deep on the ground,&#xD;
the waters of the bay near the shore were crust-&#xD;
ed, the river was closed, the free interchange of&#xD;
&#xD;
) N DALE.&#xD;
visits in the neighborhood was interrupted; la-&#xD;
dies certainly could not get out in that severe&#xD;
weather; their visiting was embargoed. Not&#xD;
so the hospital ities of the Coast House. A suc-&#xD;
cession of select and elegant oyster suppers and&#xD;
champagne parties, for gentlemen onlr, replaced&#xD;
the former entertainments. From these, of&#xD;
course, Veronica was absent; but Frank Joy,&#xD;
with all his elegant accomplishments and grace-&#xD;
ful fascinations, was there in power-and so&#xD;
those select suppers attracted the elite of&#xD;
county. Veronica was certainly very much&#xD;
alone at this time, and would have felt very&#xD;
lonely doubtless, but that her husband loved, her&#xD;
sincerely, earnestly, passionately, and that cost-&#xD;
soled her fully for the loss of all other society.&#xD;
An event soon occurred, however, that seri-&#xD;
ously interrupted her happiness.&#xD;
One night when she had retired to bed at an&#xD;
unusually late hour, leaving her husband at sup-&#xD;
per with his friends, she fell into a sweet, deep&#xD;
sleep, from which she was suddenly aroused by&#xD;
loud and angry words in high contention. The&#xD;
excited tones came from the supper-room. She&#xD;
started in terror from her bed. The chamber&#xD;
clock struck three. She listened. The voices&#xD;
grew sharp and fierce in conflict And "Cheat!"&#xD;
"Swindler!" "GAIWuaxa I!" were the terms of&#xD;
reproach she heard scornfully coupled with her&#xD;
husband's name. She did not hear his voice in&#xD;
denial--smooth, graceful, slippery, and fascina-&#xD;
ting as a serpent he seemed. She heard his&#xD;
melodious tones without catching the words.&#xD;
But a flash of light had fallen on her life, and&#xD;
revealed many, many obscurities she had not&#xD;
been able to understand before. Meanwhile the&#xD;
ugh, arrogant, and overbearing voice was loud&#xD;
in its epithets of "Gambler! 6lackleg! SHARPFIt !',~&#xD;
insultingly bestowed upon her handsome and ac-&#xD;
complished-her beloved Frank I Dressing her-&#xD;
self quickly, she descended to the supper-room,&#xD;
threw open the door, and stood pale and trem-&#xD;
bling within. The voice that had been high,&#xD;
sharp and fierce in angry and scornful invectives&#xD;
a moment before, now instantly ceased. With&#xD;
that cbivalric-nay, with that almost religious&#xD;
homage which Maryland men, even in moments&#xD;
of high excitement or intoxication, pay to wo-&#xD;
men-they all became quiet and ge~illemanly as&#xD;
soon as Veronica made her momentary appear-&#xD;
ance among them. Only her Fra'~k moved to-&#xD;
wards her in his graceful manner, and looking in&#xD;
her face with a fascinating blending of tender-&#xD;
ness with command, dreer her arm within his&#xD;
own, and with gentle force, conducted her frou&#xD;
the room back into their own chamber.&#xD;
"Remain here. I will return and explain soon&#xD;
-soon as I get these infernal fellows-I mean&#xD;
* gentlemen, away," and he left her.&#xD;
An instant after she heard his sweet, melodious&#xD;
voice, defending himself with persuasive but&#xD;
ignoble eloquence. She had been religiously&#xD;
&#xD;
~HANN4&#xD;
brought up-educated in a spiritof love, charity,&#xD;
and forgiveness-yet! if these charges were false&#xD;
she would have had her Frank rather thrust them&#xD;
down the throat of the charger, than plead his&#xD;
defence in this sweet, melodious tone! and if&#xD;
tree !-but he loved her dearly, she knew it, she&#xD;
would ask him! No! she could not do chat&#xD;
either I Ask him! that would be to insult him;&#xD;
should she insult him also-she! just after he had&#xD;
been subjected to so much ~ontumely-no I no!&#xD;
no! never!&#xD;
Presently she heard the company disperse&#xD;
quietly-his eloquence, or their consideration~&#xD;
for herself, or both had prevailed. Frank trip-&#xD;
ped lightly up the stairs-entered laughing,&#xD;
laughing gayly. Oh! how she wished he had&#xD;
not laughed. Whether true or false the charges&#xD;
-that laugh was too ignoble then I He crossed&#xD;
the chamber-threw himself gayly and grace-&#xD;
fully into a chair, and drew her to his bosom.&#xD;
"My pet! my soft, my delicate, my trembling&#xD;
little pet! So they woke you up with their&#xD;
noise, and terrified you with their violence."&#xD;
Nothing could be more soothing, snore affec-&#xD;
tionate than his manner. She replied,&#xD;
"Well, never mind now. It is all over, dear!&#xD;
And you are very good, instead of getting an-&#xD;
gry as some men would, because I came in upon&#xD;
you then-only to feel sympathy with my wo-&#xD;
manish tremors. 1 ant not given to such trem-&#xD;
bling, however; I never was!"&#xD;
"My darling! I have so much sympathy fQr&#xD;
these womanish tremors, that if they ever&#xD;
alarm them again, the brutes I they shall never&#xD;
come here again! that is all I"&#xD;
"'Never come here again!' I hope some of&#xD;
them will never dare! Oh! Frank, keep your&#xD;
forbearance, your tenderness, for your little&#xD;
spoded wife-pot for them! resent! punish such&#xD;
insult, as you forgave to-day !"&#xD;
"'Resent! punish!' is that the advice given&#xD;
by my little nun ?" he asked, gently caressing&#xD;
"Indeed it is, Frankyl I can bear offence my-&#xD;
self, but I can't endure to see you bear it! I&#xD;
cannot, indeed, Franky! Oh! please stretch that&#xD;
man at your feet, with the poker, the very next&#xD;
time he calls you such names! do, Franky! it is&#xD;
I, your timorous little wife, who loves you, too,&#xD;
that asks you to do it, because I can not live to&#xD;
see you bear insult!"&#xD;
"What! knock down General 'Hector Mount-&#xD;
leopard! a man four times my weight, and twice&#xD;
my age, dear'?"&#xD;
"'?es! it age don't bring respectability, 1 do&#xD;
not see why it should be respected !"&#xD;
"Ab! but suppose in knocking him down with&#xD;
the poker, I kilt! him, and am hanged for it? how&#xD;
then ?" asked Frank Joy, with a charming&#xD;
archness.&#xD;
"Oh! I never thought of that! I never once&#xD;
thought of that' ' only thought of the insult&#xD;
&#xD;
~NDALE.                             ' 139&#xD;
deservitig punishment! I only thought of en.&#xD;
forcing a respect to my Franky's dignity-"&#xD;
"Yes, you impulsive little creature! It is&#xD;
your charming red hair, that makes you so fiery-&#xD;
tempered! For it is red, you little vixen! Gol-&#xD;
den, your admirers call it! Yes, but it is red-&#xD;
gold! Kiss me, darling! and forget all the,&#xD;
rude brutes that have disgraced themselves and&#xD;
terrified you, this evening!"&#xD;
She was soothed, not satisfied. All the next&#xD;
week there were no suppers. At the end of the&#xD;
week, a handsome set of jewels arrived from&#xD;
Baltimore for Veronica. It was with a gay af-&#xD;
fectionate smile that Frank displayed them be-&#xD;
fore her. Veronica had, just at this time, an al-&#xD;
most childish passion for dress; this was, of&#xD;
course, the greater for its novelty; the re-diction&#xD;
of her re-nunciatory enthusiasm at the convent.&#xD;
"The greater the sinner, the greater the saint,"&#xD;
is a familiar proverb. The converse of that ap-&#xD;
peared to be tgue in Veronica's case. For a time,&#xD;
amused by her baubles, she almost ceased to&#xD;
think of the incident that had troubled her so&#xD;
much at the supper.&#xD;
A dinner~party was given, at which, among&#xD;
other guests, peeredd General Hector Mount-&#xD;
leopard; but notwithstanding Frank's warning&#xD;
to her, and his gay and smiling request to her,&#xD;
to be courteous to all his guests, Veronica met&#xD;
the General with a freezing hauteur, that with&#xD;
all his arrogance, seriously discomposed that gen-&#xD;
tleman's self-possession. At the end of the din-&#xD;
ner, Frank looked grave and displeased, for the&#xD;
first time in their married life; and Veronica&#xD;
was unhappy. For what purpose could Frank&#xD;
be so servile to an arrogant and purse proud&#xD;
man, who had grossly insulted him? And why&#xD;
should a man like General Hector Mountleopard,&#xD;
appear again at the table of a host whom he had&#xD;
degraded with such epithets as 'Sharper-Black~&#xD;
leg'?' But the latter question was more easily&#xD;
answered. Few, indeed, could resist the fasci-&#xD;
nations of Frank Joy's sunshiny temper and&#xD;
sparkling wit; and that singular look of candor&#xD;
in his broad white open brow-with its cluster-&#xD;
ing black curls! (Look at Harry's, it is the same&#xD;
brow!)&#xD;
Weeks passed, and still the handsome, gay&#xD;
and alluring man, drew constantly around him&#xD;
the gentry of the neighborhood. Veronica had a&#xD;
great concentrativeness of mind. Any impor-&#xD;
tant idea that once seized her-possessed, ab-&#xD;
sorbed her. Little things were constantly oc-&#xD;
curring to feed and keep alive the suspicion ex-&#xD;
cited by the quarrel at supper. As Winter ad-&#xD;
vanced towards Spring, she could but observe&#xD;
that the county ladies neglected her. Proud&#xD;
and shy she kept at home. Her husband was&#xD;
amassing large sums of money, she knew-by&#xD;
what mean4 she did not know. The warm, af-&#xD;
fectionate, confiding intercourse, that had hith-&#xD;
erto existed between them, was cooling of. Ij&#xD;

was not-she felt it-from any declension of love&#xD;
on either side I it was because some wrong thing&#xD;
had come between them.&#xD;
One day Frank Joy had a large dinner-party.&#xD;
The company sat late over their wine; and then&#xD;
kept up their revels all night. Veronica did not&#xD;
sleep at all. The noise assisted her mental&#xD;
anxiety, and kept her awake. At dawn of day,&#xD;
the wild, disorderly company broke up. Frank&#xD;
*   Joy came, gay, laughing, roystering, but sober,&#xD;
up the stairs. Stopped Veronica's questioning&#xD;
with a kiss-and began to pack his portmantua&#xD;
for a journey.&#xD;
"Why, where are you going, Franky ?"&#xD;
"To Baltimore, on sudden business," he an-&#xD;
swered; and the next hour he embarked in a&#xD;
packet that passed, and was oft sure enough.&#xD;
She afterwards discovered that the "sudden&#xD;
business" was the deposit of a large sum of&#xD;
money in bank, which he did not deem it safe to&#xD;
keep about the house~ In the course of that day&#xD;
a carriage rolled into die yard. A venerable&#xD;
lady, clothed in black, descended from it, and&#xD;
leaning on the arm of a young fragile girl, tot-&#xD;
tered feebly towards the bouse.&#xD;
Veronica, from the windows ~f her sitting-&#xD;
room, recognized Mrs. Martha Downs and her&#xD;
grand-daughter-Mrs. Mountleopard, the youth-&#xD;
ful wife of General Mountleopard. This was&#xD;
the first visit Veronica had received for many&#xD;
months; and it took her rather by surprise. She&#xD;
threw a large thin shawl about her shoulders, and&#xD;
went down to meet them. They were already&#xD;
in the parlor. There was a gravity upon the&#xD;
face of the old lady, a distress upon that of the&#xD;
young one, that startled Veronica with a vague&#xD;
presentiment. She went up to them and wel-&#xD;
comed them, courteously offering her hand. The&#xD;
old lady gravely withdrew hers, and immediate-&#xD;
ly opened the subject of her visit. She spoke in&#xD;
severe terms of their (Frank and Veronica's)&#xD;
having allured her son-in-law to their house-led&#xD;
him into intoxication and gambling, and won&#xD;
large sums of money from him; of his having,&#xD;
the preceding night, been made drunk, and&#xD;
swindled out of an immense amount of money.&#xD;
Shocked and indignant, Veronica's red, "golden&#xD;
red" hair, fairly bristled with scorn and anger.&#xD;
And she said it was not to be sup~vosed that she&#xD;
knew anything about her husband's amusements&#xD;
among his gentlemen guests-but that it was&#xD;
very absurd to hint, far less to say that he, who&#xD;
was almost a boy in years and in thoughtless-&#xD;
ness, should be able to tempt a veteran sinner&#xD;
ilke General Mountleopard.&#xD;
"AhI you think we don't know I You think&#xD;
we are deceived by your affectation of youthful&#xD;
simplicity I But we know-all the neighbor-&#xD;
hood knows that you two are in league! that&#xD;
your husband is as great a rogue as you are!&#xD;
that with your youth, beauty, wit, fascinations,&#xD;
you charm all the young, and delude all the old&#xD;

)NDALE.&#xD;
of the neighborhood, to their destruction I All&#xD;
the county know that you keep a gambling.&#xD;
house I and the authorities are already advised&#xD;
of that circumstance. And 1 come to counsel&#xD;
you to re-fund, and save yourselves from the&#xD;
vengeance of the law, and my unfortunate son-&#xD;
in- law from utter ruin I"&#xD;
Language can ill describe the mixed and blen-&#xD;
ded emotions of scorn, anger, suspicion, and&#xD;
shame, that raged in the high spirited woman's&#xD;
bosom. She grew white. She arose from her&#xD;
chair, tottered to the corner of the chimney-piece&#xD;
and pulled the bell rope. A servant entered.&#xD;
"Show these women out," she said, with cold&#xD;
and ashen lips, and trembling, left the room.&#xD;
That night Veronica was prematurely confined&#xD;
of a dead infant. A fortnight after, when Frank&#xD;
Joy returned, he found her still dangerously ill.&#xD;
She recovered.&#xD;
But neither the loss of their child nor the ex-&#xD;
treme illness of Veronica, arrested the down-&#xD;
ward course of the infatuated gambler. If it&#xD;
were a fact that he drew men to their ruin with&#xD;
an irresistible fascination-it was also a fatal&#xD;
truth, that he himself was the charmed victim&#xD;
of a passion, a fiend who was his tyrant.&#xD;
I described Veronica as possessing a high&#xD;
spirit and an ardent temperament, great concen-&#xD;
tration of mind, and intensity of feeling.. It was&#xD;
in vain now, that Frank 3oy sought, by his&#xD;
charming caresses and sparkling aaljies of wit,&#xD;
to beguile her thoughts and feelings from dwel-&#xD;
ling on the disgraceful facts rec~tIy confirmed&#xD;
to her. Perhaps no one, not even her husband-&#xD;
ahi least of all he-no one but myself, her com-&#xD;
panion from the cradle, could estimate the vie.&#xD;
lence of the mortal struggle that now ~onvulsed&#xD;
her soul-the struggle between her passionate at-&#xD;
tachment to her husband, and the high uncompro-&#xD;
mising sense of honor that urged her to oppose,&#xD;
to the death, all that was evil in his character&#xD;
and conduct.&#xD;
He had been to her a sort of oracle-an em-&#xD;
bodiment of her high ideal of moral and intel-&#xD;
lectual excellence. It was because he had looked&#xD;
upon her monastic vow as a superstitious act,&#xD;
that she had been led to view it in the same&#xD;
light. That was the infatuation of passion.&#xD;
But now she discovered, with wbat extreme&#xD;
anguish of soul, few who did not know her wquld&#xD;
understand-that her beautiful, her accomplish-&#xD;
ed, her most excellent one, for whom in' hee~ fond&#xD;
and blind idolatry she had abandoned her con-&#xD;
vent and her religion-whom in her madness she&#xD;
had suffTered to take the place of all intermediRte&#xD;
between her soul and God-was-what? Gain-&#xD;
bier, cheat, cowARD I She never even in her&#xD;
thoughts, degraded him with these names-yeZ&#xD;
this was what she gradually felt him to&#xD;
aye, even as she would feel the approach of ~&#xD;
death, for at killed her! But I am anticipating.&#xD;

of a Jife without him, (only she wab determined quickly fallci&#xD;

CHAPTER XLI.&#xD;
THE SECRET CRIME CONTINUED.&#xD;
Aye! Heiv~'n and e~mh do cr~ ' Thiposeible !"&#xD;

But hell doth know it true.&#xD;
Materin's Bertram.&#xD;
Many times during the recital of this story the&#xD;
old man ta~i paused aud rested. Now he stopped&#xD;
to take anme refreshment, and then strengthened&#xD;
and calmed by the composing manner of his&#xD;
young attendant, went on with his story.&#xD;
There is nothing that strikes me with more&#xD;
force than the often utter unconsciousness of a&#xD;
great criminal before the crime, of the terrible&#xD;
precipice of guilt upon which he stands. "Is&#xD;
thy servant a dog that he should do this thing ?"&#xD;
was the honest and indignant question of the&#xD;
self-ignorant Hazael.; to the wise, far-seeing&#xD;
prophet. Even so honest would have been the&#xD;
indignant repudiation echoed from the very heart&#xD;
of rn-any a criminal, if foretold his crime a week,&#xD;
a day, sn hour, before its perpetration! Sudden,&#xD;
unexpected, almost irresistible temptation falls&#xD;
upon an unprepared soul, passions aroused to&#xD;
almost maniac fury nearly or quite overwhelm&#xD;
reason and self-control; such is the history of&#xD;
most crime. He who was free from crime as&#xD;
the greater portion of his fellow beings when he&#xD;
lost his self-possession, finds himself a criminal&#xD;
at whose deeds a world shudders-tyke he comes&#xD;
~to himself," and ah! there is nothing on earth&#xD;
or in hell so wretched ~s his remorse. The les-&#xD;
son should teach us this n-great pity for the&#xD;
criminal; strict watchfulness over our own dan-'&#xD;
gerous passions.&#xD;
I was one day reading in my small study a&#xD;
rare old ilumluated volume of the fourteenth&#xD;
century, that Mrs. Summerfield, during her then&#xD;
late bridal tour, had picked up at New York, and&#xD;
just presented to me; my feet were on the hob,&#xD;
for it was a chilly day in September, just waking&#xD;
a fire comfortable. I was extremely comforta-&#xD;
ble in mind and body-little dreaming that I was&#xD;
then enjoying my very last hour of earthly ease&#xD;
-that in twenty minutes more the first of a&#xD;
series of events should occur that should deprive&#xD;
all my future of peace. Had any one in that&#xD;
nour of e~sy enjoyment foretold a sudden ca-&#xD;
ramity of which I should be the victim; a fire&#xD;
that should consume me; a fall from a horse, or&#xD;
a carriage that should kill me; a sudden illness&#xD;
that should carry me off; I should not have been&#xD;
scornfully incredulous at least; for such things&#xD;
happen in some part of the world every week-&#xD;
but !-bad any prophet or angel foretold a sud-&#xD;
den crime of which Ishould be the perpetrator-&#xD;
I should have felt like repulsing the prophecy in&#xD;
the indigpant language of Hazael, "is thy ser-&#xD;
vant a DOG that he should do this thing ?" Well,&#xD;
&#xD;
to go on-I was sitting in ease and comparative&#xD;
innocence, when Mattie came smiling in- she&#xD;
was a woman of early mid-age then-and laid&#xD;
upon my reading-desk a letter. I took it. up&#xD;
carelessly. I had no correspondents of mudi&#xD;
interest. I started slightly, ho~eever, when 1&#xD;
noticed the post-mark Green Mdle- the super-&#xD;
scription was in a strange hand to me. 1 broke&#xD;
the' seal-and merely read-&#xD;
CoAsT Housz, near Green Mills, September.&#xD;
My Only Brother -If possibly you ate yet in&#xD;
the land of the living, and yet resident at Sacred&#xD;
Heart, where 1 shall direct this letter, hasten mi-&#xD;
mediately to&#xD;
Your only sister in extremity,&#xD;
VERONICA.&#xD;
I rode like lightning to Squire Darling's. I&#xD;
borrowed the swiftest horse in his stables, and&#xD;
that same night set out for Maryland-I rode as&#xD;
for life. Oh, no one knows or could ever know&#xD;
how I loved that long lost twin sister of mine-&#xD;
my only love from infancy to age. I hurried on&#xD;
half delirious with joy, expectancy, and-fear!&#xD;
"Extremity !" what extremity? Extreme ill.&#xD;
ness-death? Should she be dead when 1 should&#xD;
reach Coast Rouse? I shuddered and hastened&#xD;
faster on-perhaps it was only extreme poverty!&#xD;
That indeed might have been reasonably pre-&#xD;
dicted from the wild improvident course of their&#xD;
lives. AhI if poverty were the extremity, how&#xD;
easy to spare from my own provision enough to&#xD;
sustain her slender wants-or, had she children?&#xD;
A hundred thoughts, anxieties, anticipations&#xD;
rushed through my mind as day and night I hur-&#xD;
ried on-still blaming myself for an unchristian&#xD;
loss of self-possession.&#xD;
1 had nearly killed Squire Darling's valuable&#xD;
"blood" by the time I reached Green Mills. 1&#xD;
left him exhausted at the inn and hastened on, on&#xD;
foot, to Coast House. I knew something of the&#xD;
present condition of the old homestead from&#xD;
hearsay-the house nearly ruined-and standing&#xD;
alone in an acre or so of thistle and weed cover-&#xD;
ed land-the farm sold and annexed to surround.&#xD;
ing large plantations-a few squalid huts in&#xD;
which vegetated a few wretched old negroes,&#xD;
past service, who were suffered to keep a foot-&#xD;
hold on their native soil, and gain a meagre living&#xD;
by trapping small game, fishing, wool picking,&#xD;
knitting coarse stockings, etc.&#xD;
That evening! What an evening it was! It&#xD;
was growing dark, and an army of storm clouds&#xD;
were mustering in the North-West as I approach-&#xD;
ed Coast House. I heard the dull booming of&#xD;
tite bay against the cliffs like the opening of s&#xD;
cannonading. The naked house loomed large&#xD;
and black through the dusky night. I clambered&#xD;
over the broken heaps of stones that had long&#xD;
ago formed the wall, and with a heavy, heavy&#xD;
sinking of the heart, went up to the great door&#xD;
of the formidable looking black front. 1 rapped,&#xD;
and my rap echoed mournfully-hollowly throng&#xD;
&#xD;
~ki A~ ~&#xD;
the vacant and deserted halls. All was dark an&#xD;
silent-and in the stillness I heard the mutterir&#xD;
of the coming storm and the booming of the ba'&#xD;
I rapped again-feeling faint with vague terror-&#xD;
again the cannonading of the bay against the cli&#xD;
was the only sound that fearfully broke the s&#xD;
lence. I turned the handle of the lock an&#xD;
pushed the door open-it fell with a heavy, lou&#xD;
clang that aroused all the roaring echoes of tb&#xD;
cavernous old house. I felt ashamed of th&#xD;
nervousness that shook me like an ague as&#xD;
passed on over the fallen door, and opening&#xD;
side door on the right, went into the room that ha&#xD;
been the family sitting.room of old. As 1 en&#xD;
tered, the lurid light of a smouldering fire in th&#xD;
ample fire-place, revealed the form of an inflrr&#xD;
woman who had risen from her seat, still holding&#xD;
on the arm of the chair, supporting her frail forni&#xD;
"Did you not hear me knock P' asked 1.&#xD;
"Hear you knock-no! how should I hear yo&#xD;
knock, amid the noises of this place? I hea&#xD;
only-the wind roaring through the house-win&#xD;
dow-fiames shaking, sashes rattling, shutter&#xD;
sometimes falling off! A door felijust now! bu&#xD;

01 Onem "&#xD;
"I wait-1 want-is Mrs. -, do yot&#xD;
know whether any of the family of the proprie&#xD;
tor is about ?"&#xD;
The womab was looking at me wistfully-&#xD;
searchingly-then sinking back in her chair, shi&#xD;
exclaimed, almost inaudibly,&#xD;
"My God! my brother."&#xD;
CC Veronica! oh, no! no! this is not my sis-&#xD;
ter!"&#xD;
1 knelt down before her, took her hands, and&#xD;
gazed intently into her face. I could read there&#xD;
not one single look of my sister !-the features&#xD;
were different, the expression was different.&#xD;
Could this old and haggard woman possibly be&#xD;
Veronica? I was pierced through with a real&#xD;
and painful doubt-as kneeling I held her hands&#xD;
and gazed iWo her face.&#xD;
"Am I so very much changed, then?" she&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
"Changed! You are revolutionized-you are&#xD;
exchanged if indeed you ever were my sister!&#xD;
Oh! Veronica! Veronica! my sister! my sister!"&#xD;
1 dropped m'~ head weeping upon her lap, and&#xD;
her head fell upon mine, and her arms entwined&#xD;
me. Whell this was over, I arose and sat by her&#xD;
side.&#xD;
"Have you eat any supper ?" she asked.&#xD;
"No, Veronica, nor have I any appetite to eat."&#xD;
"Yet you 'must do so," she said, and going to&#xD;
the old corner cupboard, she took out a little&#xD;
tea-kettle and filling with water from, a bucket&#xD;
on a bench, she hung it over the fire and threw&#xD;
on more chips from a pile near at hand. It seem-&#xD;
ed indeed as if the sitting-room of the ruinous&#xD;
old dwelling served t.s parlor, kitchen, scullery,&#xD;
wood-shed, and for every other purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
~1LJJNJJALE.                             143&#xD;
ed "Veronica, since you will have supper pre-&#xD;
g pared; let me prepare it I Heavens! how feeble&#xD;
~. you seem," said 1, ashamed now that 1 had let&#xD;
her lift her hand to serve me.&#xD;
ft "Ah! I am accustomed to these things! I&#xD;
n- have cooked for Frank a long time," she said,&#xD;
*d drawing out a little table and setting some miss-&#xD;
d matched crockery ware upon it; after which she&#xD;
.e dropped trembling and fainting into the chair,&#xD;
e and I saw with grief how much the little effort&#xD;
I~ had fatigued and exhausted her~&#xD;
a "Ah, Veronica,, of all our people i~ there none&#xD;
d left to wait on you ?"&#xD;
She smiled.&#xD;
e "Christie takes care of my little house-keep-&#xD;
fl ing, but Christie goes to her quarter at night.&#xD;
g Besides, this evening 1 want you to myself."&#xD;
L.   She got up and made the tea; put a corn john-&#xD;
ny cake and a piece of cold roast rabbit on the&#xD;
~ table, and invited me to sit down. I did so to&#xD;
r please her, forcing an appetite I did not feel.&#xD;
"To-morrow if you stay with me you shall&#xD;
~ have some oysters," she said-" old Tom is&#xD;
~ going down to the oyster-banks to get some.&#xD;
~ You never get them where you live up there in&#xD;
the Virginia mountains-they will be a welcome&#xD;
old rarity to you."&#xD;
Oh, it hurt me so to hear her talking of small&#xD;
paltry comforts for me, while she herself seemed&#xD;
to try to conceal some great grief that yet her&#xD;
heart-broken look still betrayed.&#xD;
"My poor sister, I thank you. But do not&#xD;
trouble yourself about my eating-it is giving&#xD;
undue importance to a trifle.~ I shall do well&#xD;
enough. I am neither invalid nor epicurean."&#xD;
"Ah! well! perhaps I do give 'undue ira..&#xD;
portance' to the subject-but then it is habit. I&#xD;
have been caterer and cook for an epicurean all&#xD;
my life nearly."&#xD;
This was the second time Veronica alluded to&#xD;
this fact. After supper I would not permit her&#xD;
to wash up the dishes, but pushed the table baek&#xD;
myself and drew our chairs to the fire, which I&#xD;
mended and made to blaze brightly, and sat&#xD;
down I looked inquiringly into Veronica'sfaee.&#xD;
Up tothis time I had not asked her a question of&#xD;
her life, nor did 1 intend to trouble her with one,&#xD;
but resolved to wait until she should voluntarily&#xD;
confide in me. I did not even know whether&#xD;
her husband was living or dead; whether, if&#xD;
living, he were with her; whether they had any&#xD;
children; or indeed any other fact of her late&#xD;
married life. She replied to my look of interest&#xD;
by saying,&#xD;
"I wrote to you, my brother, under a sure&#xD;
conviction elf approaching death, in order to con-&#xD;
fide to your care one charge-the child of my&#xD;
old age I"&#xD;
"Your old age, my sister-my turin sister!&#xD;

110w he would be joined to a gang of counter-&#xD;
feiters-now one of a company of travelling&#xD;
gamblers. In all his tramps, I was by his&#xD;
side, often the only female in a gang of from six&#xD;
to twenty men, always exposed to rudeness,&#xD;
often to insult. He would not permit me to re-&#xD;
main behind, nor would I have consented to&#xD;
stuy. I was ever by his side, frequently expos-&#xD;
tulating, opposing, upbraiding. You would have'&#xD;
thought, in so many years of opposition, that I&#xD;
would have grown weary of the task and aban-&#xD;
doned it; not so I I had an untiring spirit,&#xD;
-though always, elway.s his companion, I was&#xD;
never his accomplice I&#xD;
Within the last few years his temper had be.&#xD;
come very gradually soured and irritable-his&#xD;
habit of intoxication increased fearfully upon&#xD;
"'     him. I suffered often and frightfully frdm his&#xD;
violence of anger and frequent drunkenness.&#xD;
We were in Mississippi with a gang of bogus,&#xD;
coiners, when I made the discovery that 1 should&#xD;
probably bring another babe into the world to&#xD;
perish from want and exposure. He and his&#xD;
gang were travelling in a caravan, in the guise&#xD;
of harmless emigrants. Many mile. of fatigu-&#xD;
ing travel, many days of anxiety and nights of&#xD;
sleeplessness and exposure, had at last made me&#xD;
111-very ill-so il-i that I was obliged to stop.&#xD;
They left me i-n a woodman's cottage, on the&#xD;
banks of the Mississippi. He left me my trunk&#xD;
and a considerable sum of money-every cent&#xD;
he himself had, in fact, and as much more as he&#xD;
could wrest from the reluctant pockets of his&#xD;
comrades. He gave me in charge of the wood-&#xD;
man and his wife, exhorting them to take the&#xD;
greatest possible care of me, and promising mu-&#xD;
nilcent pay when he should return in a month.&#xD;
He took leave of me with visible reluctance,&#xD;
returning again and again to press a kiss upon&#xD;
my feverish brow, and to repeat his charges and&#xD;
his adieu.. As for his comrades, I believe they&#xD;
would have been glad, only that they must have&#xD;
regretted the loss of their cook and seamstress,&#xD;
for I made their coffee and sewed their buttons&#xD;
on. A few days' rest and peace restored me. I&#xD;
was up in a week. Oh! I cannot make you ut-&#xD;
derstund how highly I appreciated the quiet, so-&#xD;
cI~uded sacredness of that little humble family&#xD;
circle-the honest, hard-working woodman and&#xD;
hisinrlustrious wife, and their aged parents, and&#xD;
tbir young children, supported by their hard but&#xD;
honest work. I, who had lived for nearly twen-&#xD;

companion of counterfeiters and blacklegs! it&#xD;
seemed to me like Heaven to be there-a peace&#xD;
was falling on my spirit. Strange! though this&#xD;
was my first parting with Frank, and thouh 1&#xD;
had always dreaded such a parting above all&#xD;
things, yet now I did not feel it very painfully;&#xD;
every painful feeling was lost in a sense of peace&#xD;
and rest,-a feeling of ceeeation from evil-doing.&#xD;
Impossible, my brother, to make you or any one&#xD;
else comprehend who has not experienced it.-.-&#xD;
After that, I began actually to dread the coming&#xD;
of Frank, and my forcible re-union with the&#xD;
band. I began to wish ardently, for some quiet,&#xD;
secluded place, whore I could give life to my&#xD;
babe in safety, and rear it in peace-perchance&#xD;
in goodness.&#xD;
You know that I was always impulsive, im-&#xD;
petuous. Well, I formed the sudden resolution&#xD;
of returning home-returning here. For me to&#xD;
make a resolve, is to execute it. I wrote a letter&#xD;
to my husband, explaining my reason for leaving&#xD;
-packed my trunk-liberally paid the woodirian&#xD;
and his wife for their care of me, and the day&#xD;
before Frank was expected to re-pass again on&#xD;
his way South, I left. I believe our boats passed&#xD;
each other as I was going up the river, and he&#xD;
down. Well, I arrived here about six weeks&#xD;
since. Old Christie and Tom did not at first&#xD;
know me, but they soon recognized me. I have&#xD;
not been happy since I came, however; the fore-&#xD;
shadowing gloom of approaching death darkens&#xD;
over my spirit-I feel that I shall not survive&#xD;
my child-I feel so more than ever to-night.-&#xD;
My brother, promise that you will- stay with me&#xD;
till all is over. It will not be many days, per-&#xD;
haps not many hours. -&#xD;
"I promise, but, dear Veronica, do -not give&#xD;
way to such mournful thoughts-your first half&#xD;
of life has been very wretched, that is a sure&#xD;
earnest that the latter half will be blessed and&#xD;
happy-no long life is miserable from youth to&#xD;
age-and yours wilt not be !"&#xD;
"4' 1 live !-I believe you I-no life was ever&#xD;
wretched from yo\sth to old age, and mine will&#xD;
not be-i-f I live-but I shall not live, my bro-&#xD;
ther I I feel it! Bear with me!"&#xD;
At that moment a sheet of intense and blinding&#xD;
lightning flashed forth, filling the scene with in-&#xD;
* sufferable radiance, fo~owed by a clap of thun-&#xD;
der, whose report seer~ied to shake the founds.&#xD;
lions of the earth! The storib that had been&#xD;
gathering all this time had ntrw broken out with&#xD;
fury Amid the rattling and rolling of the thun-&#xD;
der was heard a loud-resounding crash, and a&#xD;
heavy, continuous, tumbling fall. Some part of&#xD;
the old building had been struck, and was tutu-&#xD;
bling down.~ Veronica was pale, but self pos-&#xD;
sessed. I seized my staff, and ran ~ut to&#xD;
see the amount of the damage done. A broad&#xD;
sheet of lightning illumined the landscape, and&#xD;
showed tud a wing of the old house in ruins.&#xD;

struck open the door of the sitting-room, where still something more to fear-the feeling of a&#xD;

&#xD;
the third day. My appearance there (I means&#xD;
that neighborhood ) was so natural that it cause&#xD;
no gossip. even in a gossiping community&#xD;
Frank Joy's sudden arrival and~ sudden disap&#xD;
pearance, was evidently unknown. I placed m:&#xD;
little niece out to nurse in the neighborhood-&#xD;
again shut up the house, and returned to Sacres&#xD;
Heart with death! yes! with 4e11 in my Loul&#xD;
lt was not till I found myself again in my com&#xD;
portable library at home, among my books ans&#xD;
papers, that I realized to the utmost, the terrible&#xD;
thing that had ~iappene4 tb me. My hair turne&#xD;
perfectly , white in a week "See how he love&#xD;
his sister!" sad my kind and confiding parish.&#xD;
ioners-but they were wide of the truth. Ye&#xD;
ronica! alas! much as I had loved her! deeply&#xD;
as under other circumstances 1 should hays&#xD;
mourned for her! 1 thought not of her now&#xD;
every affection! every emotion was swallowed&#xD;
up ir one absorbing remorse! At the end of tw(&#xD;
years, I went down again into Maryland, an(&#xD;
brought back with me my little niece, Harriette&#xD;
whom 1 namedafter our mother, at my sister's&#xD;
request. I even took Harriette the more as a&#xD;
satisfaction to the manes of the father, than as&#xD;
a memorial of love for the mother. Ah! ne&#xD;
feeling! none! could divide the empire of my&#xD;
sail with the one possessing, absorbing, consu-&#xD;
ming remorse r Harriette keeps that alive I-&#xD;
she has not one look of her mother 1-she has&#xD;
the very features and complexion of her father!&#xD;
Frank Joy's countenance laughs out to me from&#xD;
Hartiette's face. Years7-years of utter misery,&#xD;
have passed. Purgatory cannot be-hell cannot&#xD;
be worse than my remorse. Oh! often have I&#xD;
wished that accident might reveal that guilt&#xD;
which I lacked the moral courage to confess!&#xD;
And yet, with strange inconsistency, at the&#xD;
slightest chance of discovery I would turn sick&#xD;
with te.rror. In such unutterable sufferings had&#xD;
passed half a century, when the evil destiny&#xD;
of the neighborhood sent Sina Hinton here- Un-&#xD;
til her arrival, I had supposed my dreadful se-&#xD;
cret confined to my own burning soul. Soon at-&#xD;
ter her arrival, for purposes best known to her-&#xD;
self, she particularly sought my acquaintance,&#xD;
and my ear in every-in every company where&#xD;
we met- An inexplicable look of Frank Joy in&#xD;
her face, sickened me from the first.&#xD;
"Yet she is not at all like Harriette, whom&#xD;
you assert to be the image of him."&#xD;
"Both are,.and yet, as you say, they are not at&#xD;
alllike each other. Butit isnot unusual Take the&#xD;

"Now you may tell me, if you please, about&#xD;
Frank Joy's escape, and where he lives, and all&#xD;
about it! God bless Frank Joy, how much lam&#xD;
obliged to him for coming to life! God bless&#xD;
Frank Joy, I love him so much! Is there any-&#xD;
thing you know of that I can do to serve him?"&#xD;
said the old man, earnestly.&#xD;
"Hoer strange your joy is, father! I was&#xD;
about to say, how irrational! Juat contemplate&#xD;
It! Almost without your fault a -nan loses hi~&#xD;

with your almost miraculous skill 1"&#xD;
"Yes, I was with her in her last hours. I was&#xD;
with her when she died. I received her confess.&#xD;

"You received her confession! You gave her&#xD;
absolution I"&#xD;
"Yes! She had a lucid interval before her&#xD;
deatL We improved 'that. She was not all&#xD;
evil 1-if she had been, she would not have imid.&#xD;
dened-the good that was in her would not have&#xD;
taken such awful vengeance upon the evil, it&#xD;
is of her confession that I wish to speak. It is&#xD;
at her request that I make a part of it, which&#xD;
concerns the welfare of others, public 1"&#xD;
"Claude !-Claude Vellemonte !-none---seone&#xD;
but you, could have subdued the haughty and&#xD;
rebellious soul of that evil girl !-haughty and&#xD;
rebellious, even in her madness !-ftone but you&#xD;
could have won from her a confession, or dared&#xD;
to have given her .absolution 1"&#xD;
"Death is a great tamer, ~he passed away,&#xD;
peacefully as a child-her last breath breathed&#xD;
out upon my bosom. I was not afraid of that&#xD;
sin-bowed young head! You saw her wicked-&#xD;

wicked. 'Judge not, lestye be judged.' You&#xD;

In one word, Sina Hinton is really and truly the&#xD;
daughter of Frank Joy, by his second wife,&#xD;
whom he, in the third year of his widowhood&#xD;
married, under his alias of Hinton!"&#xD;

CHAPTER XLII.&#xD;
IMOGENE AND THE YOUNG i'RIES1~ OP ST. JOSEPH 'S.&#xD;
*&#xD;
And now the morning sun is up&#xD;
And shines upon that ble.'sed day,&#xD;
And cheers it with his brightest ray,&#xD;
And his golden beams are shed&#xD;
On the penitent's fair head,&#xD;
As her sad confession pouring&#xD;
To the priest her sin deploring,&#xD;
In penitential holiness&#xD;
She bends to hear his accents bless,&#xD;
With absolution such as may&#xD;
Wipe our mortal stains away.  Byron.&#xD;
"But, ahi hrsogene, what humiliation! what&#xD;
shame! my dear, dear child, what a trial."&#xD;
CCAh, mother! he bade me measure the ex-&#xD;
tent of my, sin by the mortification it caused me&#xD;
to confess it I"&#xD;
" Ah, my poor girl, what a degradation! would&#xD;
that I could bear it for thee, Imogene. Alas!&#xD;
alas! what humiliation for my Irnogene I"&#xD;
"My sweet, my good, my darling mother! do&#xD;
not weep so! I do not feel it as you say! I feel&#xD;
my heart fillerI and warmed with a full, deep&#xD;
comfort, and my soul exalted by a strange, sweet&#xD;
fervor! dear mother lit is well with thy child !"&#xD;
"Alas! Imogene, caust thou not guess what&#xD;
will be the probable expiation of thy guilt I"&#xD;
"1 think I can divine it, mother, when I shall&#xD;
have confided my sin of sacrilege to my spiritual&#xD;
Judge-he will assign me the expiation of the&#xD;
veil and the convent-"&#xD;
"And thou, Imogene?"&#xD;
"Oh! I will accept any doom from his lips&#xD;
with humility, and find a strange, sweet pleasure&#xD;
in enduring it! I will enter the convent and&#xD;
take the veil, and that ceremony will be-our&#xD;
betrothal for eternity I" said Imogene, with en-&#xD;
thusiasm.&#xD;
"And thy mother, Imogene ?"&#xD;
Language cannot convey the heartbroken&#xD;
tone of bitterestanguish in which the almost&#xD;
bereaved mother put this question. Even line-&#xD;
gene's exalted countenance grew still in a blank&#xD;
expression almost of despair as she said,&#xD;
&#xD;
"The Mater Doloroso will be thy support1 my&#xD;
mother! Think of Ma's' resigning her only, her&#xD;
spotless, her devoted son to the shameful and&#xD;
agonizing death of the cross for the sins of&#xD;
others; bow to the will of Heaven, and thou shalt&#xD;
be straightened to give up thy erring daughter&#xD;
to the easy expiation ,of conventuni seclusion&#xD;
and prayer. You will find a child in every saif.&#xD;
firing daughter of earth that thou can't succor,&#xD;
my mother!"&#xD;
"Ah! Imogene-dost thou think that I can&#xD;
replace thee so easily? Oh! Imogene, shall I&#xD;
remain in the world when thou art gone? No,&#xD;
child, no! I will not forsake my own old mo-&#xD;
ther! I will cling to her while her earthly life&#xD;
lasts, but then I too will offer my remaining&#xD;
days and my great sorrows to God within the&#xD;
walls of the cloister."&#xD;
Deeply distressed by the despair expressed&#xD;
even more in her tones and looks than in her&#xD;
words, Miss Summerfield turned and silently&#xD;
pressed her mother to her bosom.&#xD;
This scene occurred upon the morning of Easter&#xD;
Sunday, the day set aside for the tissigned pe-&#xD;
nance of confession. The carriage was waiting&#xD;
below to take the mo'lhor and daughter to chapel.&#xD;
They entered it and were driven to Sacred Heart.&#xD;
It was a glorious Easter Sunday! all nature&#xD;
was waking up in joy-never was the earth so&#xD;
green and fresh, the sky so blue and clear, the&#xD;
sunshine so bright and glancing; never were the&#xD;
flowers so abundant, so beautiful and fragrant;&#xD;
never were the birds so numerous, musical and&#xD;
glad! It was yet very early as they alighted at&#xD;
the church door and entered Sacred Heart. The&#xD;
congregation had not yet begun to assemble.&#xD;
The church was empty. Mrs. Suminerfield took&#xD;
her seat in her own p.ew, and, Imogene having&#xD;
embraced her mother, silently left her others to&#xD;
her private devotion and reverently sought the&#xD;
Tribunal of Confession, where, by a previous&#xD;
appointment, sat the young priest of St Joseph's&#xD;
as spiritual judge. She dared not trust lierceif&#xD;
to look up at the grave though youthful and&#xD;
beautiful countenance of her spiritual guide-&#xD;
but she felt the face of an archangel beaming&#xD;
down on her. Silently she knelt at the grating,&#xD;
folded her hands upon her bosom and b6'wed her&#xD;
head in prayer. Then, without change of pos-&#xD;
ture, her full rich voice was heard in low tones&#xD;
pleading-&#xD;
"Father-I have sinned against Heaven and&#xD;
before thee! Bless me, father, because 1 ha ~&#xD;
sinned!"&#xD;
The fair hands of the young priest were ex-&#xD;
tended and fell lightly, softly upon the beautiful&#xD;
and shame bowed head-the radiant countenance&#xD;
of the young priest shone brightly, warmly over&#xD;
her, and his harmonious voice responded in tones&#xD;
of fullest blessing:&#xD;
"May the Lord be in thy heart and on thy&#xD;
lips, that thou mayest truly and humbly confess&#xD;
&#xD;
B&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
162&#xD;
&#xD;
* This singularly trying epnfession of a sinful pas-&#xD;
sion to the reverend object, was really enforced as&#xD;
the most Appropriate and most humilia'ing expa'ion&#xD;
to be conceived of. It is' one of those things that a&#xD;
fictionist would not invent, and dare scarcely copy&#xD;
from life.&#xD;
&#xD;
SHANN(&#xD;
thy sins-in the name of the Father, and of the&#xD;
Son. and of the Holy Ghost. Amen."&#xD;
Again Miss Summerfield lowly inclined her&#xD;
head, and in an almost inaudible voice began the&#xD;
repetition of the penitential words of the comfi-&#xD;
teer.&#xD;
"I confess to Almighty God," &amp;amp;c., &amp;amp;c., &amp;amp;c,&#xD;
but her voice continued to sink and fall, and her&#xD;
color to rise-she paused&#xD;
There Wa. silsi' broken very gently at last&#xD;
by the encouraging voice of the young priest&#xD;
saying~ in w tojies,&#xD;
"My child, you should endeavor to bear in&#xD;
mind that you are in the presence of God; that&#xD;
it is to God that in reality you open your heart~&#xD;
Win the blessing of Heaven upon your confes-&#xD;
mon by namingftrst the sin, whatever it may be,&#xD;
that you feel i"ost reluctant to confess-for this&#xD;
act of se1f~rorq~est and humility will be most&#xD;
accepable in expiation."&#xD;
Again Miss Summerfield bowed her head, and&#xD;
wuemured in nearly inaudible tones,&#xD;
"[ accuse myself of having broken the first&#xD;
and greal: commandment. I have had another&#xD;
god but one. I have given to the creature the&#xD;
worship due only to the Creator. I have not&#xD;
loved God above all things. I have borne over-&#xD;
mu.~h hwe to the creature. 1 have thought ir-&#xD;
reverently of holy things. I' have despaired of&#xD;
Gud's mercy."&#xD;
Again her voice died away in silence, and her&#xD;
head drooped lower, fell upon her bosom He&#xD;
waited for her to recover herself, but she re-&#xD;
mained silent, overwhelmed He reached and&#xD;
took her hands, folded them between his own,&#xD;
and in a voice full of commanding tenderness,&#xD;
said,&#xD;
"Imogene-name specifically the sin that&#xD;
troubles thy bosom that I may be able to judge&#xD;
the state of thy conscience. Can a physician&#xD;
prescribe who does not know the natur f his&#xD;
patient's disease and symptoms? Spea4r, Imo-&#xD;
gene Offer, in the serene spirit of self abuega-&#xD;
tion, thy strong repugnance in expiat.4i of thy&#xD;
fault---~peak, Imogene I I adjure thee!"&#xD;
C' Thou hast given me a command 1 had rather&#xD;
died than obey-but-thou hast given it t? me!&#xD;
Listen, tfren I I have loved-thee, loved thee,&#xD;
more than any other being on earth-more than&#xD;
God. Mav'st thou-may God forgive me t"~&#xD;
Ost~rwhelmed with shame her head fell for-&#xD;
ward upon the grating as in a swoon, but she had&#xD;
not swooned. Silence fell again between them.&#xD;
At last-" Hast thou any other thing with&#xD;
&#xD;
)NDALE                               153&#xD;
which to accuse thyself, Imogene ?" he inquired,&#xD;
in a low tone.&#xD;
"None-none," she murmured.&#xD;
"Hear me then, Imogene Your greatest&#xD;
fault has been-a want of fortitude and faith in&#xD;
God-in your mother and your spiritual guide;&#xD;
and that moral cowardice and unbelief has caus-&#xD;
ed your greatest suffering-in leaving your mind&#xD;
to a dark, a blind, and a false misapprehension&#xD;
of yourself, of me, and of our circumstances and&#xD;
duties. Had you cleared your bosom of this&#xD;
secret from your first discovery of its existence,&#xD;
you would then have saved yourself and others&#xD;
all the sorrow that has grown out of it. Will&#xD;
you look at me, Imogene? You have not raised&#xD;
your eyes to mine since you kneeled down here.&#xD;
What is there in my face to alarm you? Will&#xD;
you look at me, Imogene ~&#xD;
She raised her eyes and met the calm, clear gaze&#xD;
of the radiant eyes through which the pure, strong&#xD;
soul shone so truthfully. She felt that there was&#xD;
nothing in those eyes or that soul to shrink from.&#xD;
He took her bands between his own, and gazing&#xD;
down into her upraised eyes, spoke:&#xD;
"Can you, Imogene, whenever in the future,'&#xD;
a sin or a sorrow troubles you-~can you lay that&#xD;
sin or sorrow on my heart ?'~&#xD;
"Oh! 1 can-I can as on the bosom of the&#xD;
Virgin Mother!"&#xD;
"Can you, Imogene, confide every secret of&#xD;
your soul to my keeping ?"&#xD;
"Oh! I can as to the bosoni of my Saviour."&#xD;
"Will you trust me implicitly with the gui~..&#xD;
dance of your life? .Will you confide your earth-&#xD;
ly and immortal welfare to my care 7Y~&#xD;
"Oh, I will! I will! so trustingly! so confi-&#xD;
dently! so gladly! even as to my God !"&#xD;
The young priest folded his hands together and&#xD;
remained for awhile absorbed in meditation, or in&#xD;
silent prayer At last stretching forth his hands&#xD;
as in benediction, he said, in a sweet, but solemn&#xD;
voice,&#xD;
"Daughter, I am about to pronounce the abso~&#xD;
tion and remission of thy sins."&#xD;
"But~ Holy Father, my penance-my expia-&#xD;
tion ?" murmured Imogene, very gently-.di~-&#xD;
dently interrupting him&#xD;
A singular but inexpressibly sweet, benignant,&#xD;
and happy smile illumined his features for an in-&#xD;
stant, and then passed away, leaving oiz ~&#xD;
countenance an elevated solemnity befitting the&#xD;
confessional, he replied, with grave tenderness,&#xD;
"Trve, my penitent-thy expiation-do not&#xD;
believe that for a single instant I had lost sight&#xD;
of that necessity; I did but delay thy sentence.&#xD;
The time, the place, and the manner of thy&#xD;
penance, I will reveal to thee to-morrow, in thy&#xD;
mother's house and presence. Thy expiatihit,&#xD;
Imogene, will be the work of thy whole life;&#xD;
nay, it will change the whole course and purpose&#xD;
of thy life; it will affect thy earthly and iminer-&#xD;
tal destiny~ and that of others through thee.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7877-00000079"/>&#xD;
154                              BRAN!&#xD;
Thou will find in its course, much of trial; muc&#xD;
of toil; frequent occasions for self-denial; muc&#xD;
of suffering for the sake of others, wh'~ may,&#xD;
their ingratitude, disappoint and grieve thee;&#xD;
short, much of every sorrow; but thou shalt als&#xD;
find more of compensation; more of well-earne&#xD;
comfort and enjoyment; more of gratitude an&#xD;
love from others; more of heart-felt, soul-fell&#xD;
social and religious happiness I"&#xD;
A pause gave Imogene an opportunity of reply&#xD;
ing.; a certain fervor of emotion impelled her t&#xD;
reply. She murmured in tones, low, but, oh! s&#xD;
fbll of earnest feeling,&#xD;
"I understand thee; I had even anticipate&#xD;
this manner of expiation. My mother is als&#xD;
prepared to hear it. We spoke of it this morn&#xD;
ing. She is resigned. I understand thy dela;&#xD;
also, and thy soothing, strengthening words&#xD;
Thou wouldst prepare me; thou wouldat comfort&#xD;
and strengthen me to hear and bear the door&#xD;
thou shalt so compassionately pronounce Fea&#xD;
not for me; it will not be bitter-the fate. I&#xD;
will be sweets coming from thee. Pear not;&#xD;
accept it! Only one thing I will plead for-thoi&#xD;
wilt be present at the ceremonials that shall sea&#xD;
my destiny-thou wilt if possible-if it may b&#xD;
permitted.-thyself receive my vows -ehysel&#xD;
place the veil upon my brow, the ring upon m~&#xD;
finger?"&#xD;
"It shall be so, Imogene. I solemnly promise&#xD;
thee to be present at thy religious espousals-&#xD;
and, Imogene-" here he took her hands, foldin;&#xD;
them between his own-" Imogene, look up.'&#xD;
She raised her eyes to his, that were looking ful&#xD;
upon her. They gazed into each other's eye&#xD;
till soul met soul, and then he continued in&#xD;
tone of sweet solemnity, "And, Imogene, thai&#xD;
ritual will seal our union for all eternity-dosi&#xD;
thou believe it I"&#xD;
"-Oh! I do! I do! I do know it so well-fee&#xD;
it so deeply. I used those very words to express&#xD;
t!lat very conviction this morning I"&#xD;
He looked long into her eyes. and then said,&#xD;
"1 am about to absolve thee, Imogene I"&#xD;
She crossed her hands upon her bosom and&#xD;
bowed her bead in the very devotion of reve-&#xD;
rence. He extended his palms, which descended&#xD;
slowly, and fell lightly, softly upon her graceful&#xD;
head, and said,&#xD;
"May the Almighty and Merciful Lord give&#xD;
thee pardon, absolution and remission of thy sins,&#xD;
and bring thee to life everlasting. May our&#xD;
Lord and Saviour absolve thee; and by His au-&#xD;
thority I absolve thee from every bond of ex~&#xD;
communication, and of interdict as far as I have&#xD;
power and thou hast need. I, therefore, do ab-&#xD;
solve thee from all thy sins, in the name of the&#xD;
Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost&#xD;
May whatsoever food thou. shalt do, or evil thou&#xD;
shalt suffer, be to thee, unro the remission of thy&#xD;
sins the increase of grace, and the recompense&#xD;
of life everlasting. Amen."&#xD;

qONDALE.&#xD;
h Re ceased. Imogene remained kneeling in&#xD;
h silent prayer a moment, and then rising, slowly&#xD;
n and reverently, but with a peaceful a'd radiant&#xD;
n countenance, was about to leave the confessional,&#xD;
o when their eyes met in a long earnest gaze. He&#xD;
d did not withdraw his-she could not drop or veil&#xD;
d hers. A strong, an omnipotent attraction seized,&#xD;
~, maddened, nearly1maseered her! To turn away&#xD;
from him was not painful, it was agonizing; it&#xD;
was not difficult, it was deathly-not parting&#xD;
o from one beloved, but the inevitable, the violent&#xD;
o rending in two of soul and body. She passed&#xD;
from the confessional. The light and warmth&#xD;
d that had hitherto sustained her-the healthful,&#xD;
o .strengthening and happy influence of the young&#xD;
priest upon her whole being, seemed abandoned.&#xD;
y A change slowly, coldly, darkly overslept her&#xD;
spirit. Never did one going from a genial,&#xD;
t warmed and lighted home out into the dark&#xD;
ri night and freezing cold, feel the transition phy.&#xD;
r sically so slowly, painfully, as she did spiritual-&#xD;
t ly. She reached her pew dizzy, suffocated, blind,&#xD;
I swooning nearly, and sinking down in her seat;&#xD;
ii and without looking at her mother, she dropped&#xD;
I her head forward upon the front of the pew,&#xD;
e while her despairing thoughts took something&#xD;
f like this shape-&#xD;
~    "I shall see him but twice more in ~py whole&#xD;
life; to-morrow .vhen he comes, and in his&#xD;
s sweet, commanding tones, tells me to enter a&#xD;
- convent; when 1, intoxicated with his presence,&#xD;
~ and powerless, under his will, shall, with a smile,&#xD;
hut an illusory smile, accept the destiny, as I&#xD;
1 did just now. He will then leave me, and I shall&#xD;
* fall into despair, as 1 do this moment. Years&#xD;
will pass, and I will vegetate through a loath-&#xD;
I some life, like that of a rank, aquatic weed, on&#xD;
the damp walls of some sub-marine dungeon.&#xD;
Then we shall meet again, and for the last, last&#xD;
I ti-me. And again, and for the last, last time,&#xD;
shall come the short lived joy, ecstacy, insanity,&#xD;
of his presence. When he whom I love so devo-&#xD;
tedly, who loves me so entirely, will place the&#xD;
ring upon my finger, the black veil on my brow,&#xD;
and disappear forever from my view. And then&#xD;
- -and then-and then I shall sink into a living&#xD;
death-be inhumed alive! Shall I live? can I&#xD;
exist, a poor, divided being, in a .living tomb?&#xD;
AhI yes; for I am the strongest of a strong and&#xD;
long lived race- We are hard to kill; myself&#xD;
the most indestructible of the whole. Nothing-&#xD;
no, nothing but a conflagration, or some other&#xD;
catastrophe ending in a violent death, can pre-&#xD;
vent my spending sixty or seventy years of a&#xD;
living death in the grave of the convent."&#xD;
strong and fearful reaction was movingwithin&#xD;
her. Her whole strong heart, soul and intellect,&#xD;
was in open insurrection Her whole nature&#xD;
rising in terrible and uncompromising rebellion&#xD;
against the tyranny and the violence put upon&#xD;
it. Wave upon wave of passion rolling up from&#xD;
the deeps of her soul, stormed in her tempestuous&#xD;
&#xD;
~HANNO NDAL.E.&#xD;
&#xD;
bosom, exciting there wild ann sinful, and frr&#xD;
kee-, unprecedented thoughts. -&#xD;
"Is Heaven itself worth purchase at this price,&#xD;
this awful sacrifice? Alas! I madden! I sin! I&#xD;
am only good; I am only strong; I am only reli-&#xD;
gious; 1 only live when Claude is with me, or&#xD;
when I feel that his spirit is near me-as just&#xD;
now at the confessional-as sometimes at home.&#xD;
I am evil; I am weak; I am irreligious; I die&#xD;
when Claude is absent, and withdraws his&#xD;
thoughts from me as now! It is not insanity; It&#xD;
is not falsehood; it is not even fancy; but it is&#xD;
truth-God's holy truth-that I am but the divi-&#xD;
ded and quivering moiety of a human being when&#xD;
separated from Claude's presence, and absent&#xD;
from his thoughts. I cannot! I cannot! I can-&#xD;
not- I"&#xD;
For the first time, perhaps, in all her life,&#xD;
Imogene, forgetful of - her surroundings, lifted up&#xD;
her voice and wept! Wept! nay, her whole&#xD;
soul and body was v;olently convulsed; her&#xD;
whole nature for the first time passionately re-&#xD;
belled against her destiny&#xD;
The mother and daughter were as yet quite&#xD;
none in the church; but it was to be expected&#xD;
every instant that some one would come in; that&#xD;
soon the chapel would fill Mrs Summerfield&#xD;
especially, fearing such a probable interruption&#xD;
and observation, stole her arm enitly around her&#xD;
daiff'ilter's waist, and murmured, in gentle tones,&#xD;
C Imogene, love, the congregation will be&#xD;
gathering soon; if you canflot compose yourself&#xD;
we bad better return home, dear, lest we draw&#xD;
observation upon us."&#xD;
"Oh, yes! home-home--let ps go home I"&#xD;
gasped Irnogene; and they were quietly arising&#xD;
to leave the pew, when the deep, rica tQnes of&#xD;
Claude Vellemonte at the pew door, arrested&#xD;
them. He reached his hand over to Mrs. Sum-&#xD;
merfield to shake hands wito her. The mother's&#xD;
brow crimsoned for an instant at the sight of the&#xD;
young priest, until she met his eyes, so full of&#xD;
strength and purity, when her agitation subsided.&#xD;
The storm in Imogene's bosom was also stillefl&#xD;
The magnetic, the fabled miracidqus power of&#xD;
Claude Vellemonte was once more felt by both&#xD;
mother and daughter, as he stooped over the lat-&#xD;
ter and said,&#xD;
"Imogene, what Is the matter? Compose&#xD;
thyself, my dear child. Before and above all&#xD;
things, believe in thy Father's love. - He who&#xD;
created thee, loves thee, Jipogene; desires thy&#xD;
happiness; believe and receive this, for it is&#xD;
true; hear His words ' Verily I say unto you,&#xD;
there is no man hath left house, or brethren, or&#xD;
sister, or father, or mother, or wife, or children,&#xD;
or land, for my sake and the gospel's,&#xD;
1c 'But shall receive an hundred fold ~ew us&#xD;
ThUS viwn-houses, and brethren, and sisters, and&#xD;
mothers, and children, and lands, with persecu-&#xD;
tions---and in the "vorld r0 come eternal life.' Thus&#xD;
you see, Imogesie, 'Godliness is profitable in all&#xD;
&#xD;
16&amp;amp;5&#xD;
&#xD;
things, having the promise of THIS r~rrz, and of the&#xD;
life to come' But, lmogen~, to avail thyself of&#xD;
Gospel promises, thou must believe in and $&#xD;
se.pon thess. Imogene, repose on tne promises.&#xD;
Be believing- Be calm. Be cheerful Have~ a&#xD;
modest confidence us the mercy of thy Divine&#xD;
Parent. Remain here, Imogene- 1 will see thee&#xD;
again to-morrow-" He stroked her brow gently,&#xD;
and was gone.&#xD;
That day the young priest took for his text the&#xD;
Scripture: "Whoever will lose his life for My&#xD;
sake and the kingdom of Heaven's, shall save&#xD;
it." His text and sermon were singularly ap-&#xD;
propriate to Easter Sunday, the morning cele-&#xD;
brating the Resurrection of our Saviour from the&#xD;
dead; and as singularly appropriate to the state&#xD;
of at least one of his hearers. He spoke of the&#xD;
Saviour's voluntary resignation of His life. Of&#xD;
the anguish, the terror, and the failing, dying&#xD;
faith of His disciples, as they witnessed His&#xD;
arrest, His trial, execution, and burial. Of the&#xD;
deep, the utter despair that followed that event.&#xD;
He dwelt upon this picture so earnestly, so ole-&#xD;
quently, that even his hearers were cari'ied back,&#xD;
in imagination, eighteen hundred years, and felt&#xD;
that all hope had gone down with the Saviour to&#xD;
the grave. Then as he turned sunward to the&#xD;
glorious morning of the resurrection, his whole&#xD;
countenance was transfigured before them, and&#xD;
beamed with an archangelic radiance and powe&#xD;
as he depicted that startling, that electrifying&#xD;
denouement. The surprise, the joy, the ecstasy&#xD;
of the disciples, in hailing again their risen and&#xD;
glorified Lord and Saviour, now proven Lord and&#xD;
Saviour beyond the shadow of a doubt! their re-&#xD;
newed and strengthened faith, renewed and&#xD;
strengthened, for all eternity. Finally he drew&#xD;
from this a consolation for all christiaps tempted&#xD;
to despair. Their buried bye and hope, buried,&#xD;
forever, in their thoughts, would rise again!&#xD;
would rise in joy! in glory! and surprise them&#xD;
into an ecatacy of gratitude and worship! *&#xD;
But 1 feel that in giving this third-hand re-&#xD;
port of Claude Vellemonte's inspired and most&#xD;
eloquent Easter Sunday sermon, I am doing him&#xD;
injustice. Very weakly do his great, strong&#xD;
words,-very coldly do his fiery words, flow&#xD;
through my feeble pen. In fine, there waa more&#xD;
than one soul raised, comforted and strengthened&#xD;
that day!&#xD;
At the close of the services, Claude Velle-&#xD;
monte announced that Father Burleigh had re-&#xD;
covered his health, and expected, with the bless.&#xD;
ing of Heaven, to resume his place in the&#xD;
pulpit upon the next Sunday- That in conse-&#xD;
quence of that and other circumstances, which&#xD;
would be duly made known to them, his own&#xD;
*hort and delightful connection with the congre-&#xD;
gation of the Sacred Heart Chapel would ~d&#xD;

should take an affectionate and a final leave 9&#xD;

event of Father Burleigh's recovery, was to&#xD;
natural and too much to be expected, to cause&#xD;
any surprise how much aoever of regret it might&#xD;
and did occasion. The congregation was then&#xD;
dismissed. The mother and daughter returned&#xD;
home. Imogene, at least calm, if not happy.&#xD;

"My love! my dear love! my Imogene! you&#xD;
are not mad-or going mad-yours is a delirium&#xD;
of the nerves--a frenzy of excited emotion-do&#xD;
nor have such dreadful thoughts I dismiss them&#xD;

~ Let me go merrily mad, not melancholy&#xD;
mad, kind angels 1" exclaimed iinogene, with a&#xD;
wild, hysterical laugh! How unlike herself!&#xD;
Really' alarmed now for her daughter's reason,&#xD;
Mrs. Summerfield with difficulty subdued her&#xD;
own emotions, and souebt to so~tbe Iinogene.&#xD;
She used every moral and material means within&#xD;
her reach, to compose her violently excited&#xD;
nervous system, and finally succeeded in getting&#xD;
her to bed av.d 'ullin~ hsr to sleep. There was&#xD;
&#xD;
).ND ALE.&#xD;
ono sleep, however, for Mrs. Summerfield. The&#xD;
lady paced slowly up and down t~e gorgeous but&#xD;
dimly lighted chamber of her daughter, think-&#xD;
ing, with deep anxiety, of all the cases of insa-&#xD;
nity she had heard of, arising from religious fa-&#xD;
naticism, where it conflicted violently with&#xD;
some natural law of our being. Then she passed&#xD;
in review the whole history of Imogene's life,&#xD;
since her return hoi~e, and all that she had re-&#xD;
vealed of her life at school. The visions of her&#xD;
illness, it is true, were probably merely the tem-&#xD;
porary effect of virulent fever; but the visions&#xD;
of her convalescence were a more alarming&#xD;
matter. And after her arrival at home, her&#xD;
profound melancholy even deepening to gloom;&#xD;
her days of depression, her nights of elevation;&#xD;
and what was still more dreadful, her violent,&#xD;
opposite and inconceivable alternations of mood,&#xD;
within the last few weeks; being at one hour so&#xD;
deeply despairing, at another exalted into such&#xD;
a beavei~ of rehgioos ec.sta~.y, and anon, so in-&#xD;
effably serene; all these things presented them-&#xD;
selves to the mother's mind in a new and terri-&#xD;
ble light.&#xD;
Yes, yes, wounded affections, violated natural&#xD;
laws, religious fanaticism, were taking a terrible&#xD;
vengeance upon their subject, in doing this work&#xD;
of mental destruction upon Imogene. Her over-&#xD;
burdened and over-wrought heart and brain were&#xD;
desperately struggling for existence amid the&#xD;
horrors of this furious moral typhoon, and her&#xD;
glorious intellect in imminent danger of ship-&#xD;
wreck amid the metaphysical breakers a' ound her.&#xD;
Now, perhaps, for the first time in Mrs. Sum-&#xD;
merfield's life, a doubt of the righteousness of&#xD;
that ecclesiastical doctrine by which her daugh-&#xD;
t~-r was made to suffer such extremity of an-&#xD;
guish, remorse and humiliation, which would&#xD;
eventuate assuredly in confl.rmed madness, arose&#xD;
in the mother's mind; but it was immediately&#xD;
suppressed as sinful.&#xD;
Not so easily, however, were her too well&#xD;
grounded fears for Imogene subdued. Nothing&#xD;
but the common life would restore Imogene to&#xD;
sound health of mi"d and body People were&#xD;
not created with five senses, and put 'pon ttiis&#xD;
solid earth, covered, as it is, with material beau-&#xD;
ties and pleasures, to lose their sense in spiritual&#xD;
abstraction, any more than to degrade them in&#xD;
excessive luxury. The medium! the medium!&#xD;
There was right-there was wisdom. IVI . Sims'.&#xD;
merfield nowfelt this, but, for her immo~tat soul's&#xD;
salvation, she dared not thin&amp;amp; it out! So she&#xD;
sighed and groaned, and paced up and down the&#xD;
gorgeous chamber, till at length she went and&#xD;
prostrated herself before the image of the Virgin,&#xD;
on the elegant little altar we have described be-&#xD;
fore. Here, in silent prayer and meditation, she&#xD;
spent the remaining hours of the night. Mean-&#xD;
while, from the united effects of mental and phy-&#xD;
sical exhaustion and of an opiate, Miss Summer.&#xD;

A servant entered, and placing a card in Miss&#xD;
Summerfield's hand, retired. She read it indo-&#xD;
lently, without at first taking in its meaning.&#xD;
She looked at it again, and grew pale as she read&#xD;
the namt~ engraved on it aloud-" MONS. Lz&#xD;

She looked up, and Claude Vellemonte stood be-&#xD;
fore her; or, was this indeed the young priest of&#xD;
St. Joseph's? No! for the priestly garb was&#xD;
gone-and this gentleman wore a quiet citizen's&#xD;

bent and pressed his lips to hers in the very&#xD;
first, virgin kiss he had ever given woman! or&#xD;
she had ever received from man I It was a life-&#xD;
giving kiss to both! and he gazed down in her&#xD;
radiant eyes with a smile of pure ecstatic joy,&#xD;
lighting another smile in her face, such as only&#xD;
children or angels wear!&#xD;
And she! Was she shocked, alarmed-was&#xD;
she even surprised at this sudden, this unprece-&#xD;
* dented joy? or, seas it unprecedented? No! for&#xD;
even thus they had often met in the spiritual land,&#xD;
in dreams, that seemed as real as this! No! It&#xD;
seemed so right, so natural, or rather, every&#xD;
thought and emotion was swallowed up in a feel-&#xD;
ing of measureless content, as she lay there in&#xD;
the pure .srms of her spotless, her almost divine&#xD;
lover-as she lay there, lost In a trance of joy.&#xD;
Nor one word of explanation had been spoken-&#xD;
yet* she was so naturally, so inexpressibly hap-&#xD;
py! While Claude dazed down upon her, his&#xD;
radiant eyes showering blessings, and more di-&#xD;
vinely blessed himself in the sense of giving,&#xD;
than of receiving happiness. At last he mur-&#xD;
mured lowly under his breath,&#xD;
"You beautiful and happy child! Oh, to hold&#xD;

where in dreams only it has ever laid! Ah, rest&#xD;

lips again, lighting softly on them.&#xD;

"Always! Always! Imogene, I was with&#xD;
you in niy dreams! By day, 1 would conscien-&#xD;
tious!y dismiss you-but 'sleep has its own&#xD;
world,' governed by its own laws-there 1 ever&#xD;
found you again."&#xD;
"You were ever with me in your dreams ?"&#xD;
"Ever-ever, Imogene I"&#xD;
"I knew and felt it! My days were wretch-&#xD;
ed; but my nights were unutterably happx !"&#xD;
"My beautiful embodied dream. Mv happy&#xD;
dream embodied, and in my arms! Why, Imo-&#xD;
gine, you are so real, I cannot realize you!&#xD;
Long glossy purple locks! majestic brow, and&#xD;
glorious eyes! and lips! Ah! my beautiful&#xD;
dream-bride! I shall never! never! never! wake&#xD;
up again and lose you;" and stooping, his lips&#xD;
grew fo hers again!&#xD;
"Mr. Vellemonte!!! Father Vellemonto ! !!!&#xD;
I am HONORED! ASTOUNDED I" exA~laimed the&#xD;
voice of Mrs Summerfield, who at this '~ritic.si&#xD;
moment appeared, and was struck still in the&#xD;
door, like a statue of horrified astonishment in its&#xD;
niche; "Mr. VellArionte Father V~-llemonte, I&#xD;
my! you horrify me beyond measure! In the&#xD;
Virgin's name, what dreadful sacrilege is this ?"&#xD;
They do not see or hear her-for&#xD;
"Heedless as ihe dead are they&#xD;
0; aught around. above, beneath,&#xD;
As if all else had passed away-&#xD;
They nn!y for each other breathe."&#xD;
"Mr Vellemo ate! FATHER VeUemorue! Do&#xD;
you Wish to i~ir..r. me, then 1"&#xD;
"Oh! my dream bride! my beautiful embo-&#xD;
died spirit bride !" murmured the entranced&#xD;
man, straining her again and again to his beom,&#xD;
and pressing fervent kisses on her brow and&#xD;
eyes and lips, in the very ecstacy of rapture!&#xD;
"My God! 1 shall presently madden! Imo-&#xD;
gene! my daughter! Mrss SUMMHRPTELD !~! ex-&#xD;
claimed the deeply scandalized lady, in the en-&#xD;
tremity of distress.&#xD;
"Ak, Claude! my archangel! when did I die?&#xD;
I do not remember-when came 1 to Heaven,&#xD;
Claude ?" sighed Imogene, quite lost in a trance&#xD;
of joy.&#xD;
"FATHER VHI.rziworsTn, release my daughter,&#xD;
this moment!" exclaimed the lady, flying to-&#xD;
wards them.&#xD;
Claud~e now looked up-did he drop Imogene?&#xD;
No, indeed! Had a thunderbolt fallen at his&#xD;
feet, he wouPi not have dropped h~r theii I Re&#xD;
took time to kiss her agman, and gather her&#xD;
&#xD;
S H AN NO NDnA LB.&#xD;
&#xD;
closer to his bosom, before he answered, entire-&#xD;
ly at random, an observation whose sound he&#xD;
had only beard.&#xD;
"Yes, madam, certainly!"&#xD;
"You shameless man!" cried the excited&#xD;
lady, in a choking voice. /&#xD;
A sense of the absurdity of the whole thing,&#xD;
now struck Claude, who, with the first inclina-&#xD;
tion for humor that had visited him for many a&#xD;
day, now arose, and setting Imogene upon her&#xD;
feet, presented her to her mother, and said,&#xD;
"Mrs. Summerfield, let me crave your con-&#xD;
gratulations fo-r my betrothed wife-Madame La&#xD;
Duchesse De Vellemonte !"&#xD;
Tue lady had been very red before, she now&#xD;
grew deadly white-a look of unutterable sor-&#xD;
row chased every expression of anger from her&#xD;
face, and gazing on them both wit~h profound&#xD;
pity, she said, in a voice full of grief-&#xD;
"Ah, my God! 1 see it all now! God knows&#xD;
that they have both gone mad!"&#xD;
Srn.itten~with compunction for the pain he had&#xD;
given her, Claude Vellenionte took her hand in&#xD;
the most respeetfnl manner, and said-&#xD;
"Mrs. - Summerfield 1-mother-my honored&#xD;
mother! I am neither mad nor guilty, iwr is&#xD;
yovr daughter, whose faith in me, was to her--&#xD;
~nowiedge. What I say to you, only requires&#xD;
your consent and blessing, to make it truth!&#xD;
You knew before that I was the son of the ban-&#xD;
ished Duke De Vellemonte, who, during the&#xD;
.Reignof Terror, became a refugee in this con;-&#xD;
try, an I died at St Joseph's; you know that I&#xD;
obeyed his dying will rather than followed my&#xD;
own vocation, in entering the priesthood; you&#xD;
know he chose this life for me because he thought&#xD;
the patrimonial title and estate forever gone;&#xD;
and because his last days were characterized by&#xD;
extreme religious dev&amp;amp;ion. Three years ago I&#xD;
fouWd that I loved Imogene too well to make a&#xD;
good priest. I struggled desperately with this&#xD;
feeling, until I discovered that Imo~eire loved&#xD;
me. I struggled with it then no longer, but, 83&#xD;
I was yet scarcely entered upon my clerical du-&#xD;
ties, I wrote to Rome a history of the whole&#xD;
matter, praying our Moft Holy Father a'dispensa-&#xD;
tion. from. my vows, but leaving my destiny en-&#xD;
tirely in his hands, expressing the fullest dis.&#xD;
position to resign myself to his wi!l. While&#xD;
I was making this appeal from America,. some&#xD;
of wy father's old friends, who had gained the&#xD;
high favor of the Emperor, remembered the&#xD;
exiled son of their banished friend, and exerted&#xD;
their interest for me. The end of both their ~n-&#xD;
tercession and my petition was, that six weeks&#xD;
ago two packets arrived for me, one from Paris,&#xD;
containingdispatchesthatre-investedmewith my&#xD;
late father's title and eStates, and recalledzne to&#xD;
Paris; and the other, comprising a dispensation&#xD;
from my priestly vows-that dispensation to&#xD;
take effect after vesper hour on Easter~Sunday&#xD;
evening."&#xD;
&#xD;
tgg&#xD;
&#xD;
Then, turning to Miss Summerfield, he said-&#xD;
"Imogene, my child: di'! I anticipate the date&#xD;
of this dispensation by~n hour?- did I not&#xD;
faithfully pay the uttermost farthing ot my duty,&#xD;
even in the trial of hearing thy enforced and ex-&#xD;
piatory confession? Did I ever, by word or&#xD;
look, offend thee? I heard thy confession, line-.&#xD;
gene, because, my child, my approaching dis-&#xD;
pensation did not wipe from thy soul the sin of&#xD;
sacrilege you committed in loving a priest-and&#xD;
because that penance was laid upon thee by thy&#xD;
Father Confessor, and obedience to thy spiritual&#xD;
guide, was necessary. When I absolved thee of&#xD;
thy sin, Imogene, I could not assure to thee a&#xD;
compensation for thy sufferings, for that would&#xD;
have then been a breach of the vows which&#xD;
bound me until evening. But when 1 saw thee&#xD;
so meekly resigned to give up all the pleasures&#xD;
of the earth, and in the seclusion of the convent&#xD;
expiate thy error by devoting thyself to God-&#xD;
I could and did say, in the words of Christ-&#xD;
'Verily I say unto thee that no man hath left&#xD;
house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mo-&#xD;
ther, or wife, or children, or lands for my sake,&#xD;
and the gospel's; but he shal! receive an hun-&#xD;
dred fold now in THIS TIME--houses, and bre.-&#xD;
thren, s.nd sisters, and mothers, and children,&#xD;
and lands with persecutions; and in the world&#xD;
to come, eternal life!' But oh! thou faithless&#xD;
and despairing child, thou did'st not bind it to&#xD;
thy bleeding heart. It was my faith, my Izn6-&#xD;
gene, that saved thee. Ah, Imogene's mot'ier!&#xD;
I have a vocation for the priesthood !- Heaven&#xD;
doth truly know that 1 have! But not for ice&#xD;
necessary celibacy-I have too large a human&#xD;
hear!; for that-and had this great tide of nato-&#xD;
ral affections been turned back upon my heart,&#xD;
it would have become a burning and cenautwug&#xD;
fire, that would have dried up all the' milk, of&#xD;
human kindness in my nature; all the blocd in&#xD;
my veins; all the flesh on my bones; and this&#xD;
fine, vital temperament of mine, thai. enables&#xD;
.me to do so much for others more feeble-would&#xD;
have changed. In body I should have grown&#xD;
bilious, sallow, thin, and leathery; and the ruin&#xD;
of mind and soul would have been still greater.&#xD;
I should have become bigoted, fanatical, asee.-&#xD;
tic, harsh, given to persecution. Those few&#xD;
cruel priests whom history records as standing&#xD;
reproaches to the holy mother church, were con-&#xD;
scientious men, of ardent temperaments, whose&#xD;
strong natural affections, turned back from theu~&#xD;
natural course upon the heart and brain, becatna&#xD;
furious fires, exciting them to deeds of cruelty;&#xD;
for such men must -~rv, must feel their i4ij~ if&#xD;
not in human loves, why then in human, Or&#xD;
thor, in fiendish hates, and in the excitet2i~&#xD;
that scenes of blood afford!. History has dealt&#xD;
severely with them, because philosol~hy ha not&#xD;
revealed them. No, Mrs. Summerfie!d, all mez~&#xD;
are not fit for the priesthood~ nor all women for&#xD;

The secular duties of~he priesthood, and of the "Hydropathy and Mesmerism-the two great&#xD;
Sisters of Mercy, are incumbent upon every son ministers of health, happiness and life-were&#xD;

these secular duties of the priesthood, while I&#xD;
live, will I perform in obedience to the text-&#xD;
'Freely have ye received-freely give."'&#xD;
CHAPTER XLV.&#xD;
WINNY.&#xD;
Courage !-you travel through a darkeome cave,&#xD;
But still as nearer to the light you draw,&#xD;
Fre4 galee will meet you from the upper air,&#xD;
Ai~d wholesome dews of heaven your forehead lave,&#xD;
And darkness lighten more, till full of awe,&#xD;
You stand in the open sunshine, unaware.&#xD;
R. C Frenck.&#xD;
Winny Ardenne I-have you lost sight of that&#xD;
gentle sufferer, reader ?-is she forgotten, be-&#xD;
cause, in the noise of violent and conflicting&#xD;
passions, and the shock of sudden and tragic&#xD;
events, the still music of her gentle life is tin-&#xD;
heard? She is not forgotten by any one near&#xD;
her. Mrs. Summerfield, amid her heavy domes-&#xD;
tic trials, and Imogene, in her suffering, had still&#xD;
fopo$ ioom in their hearts for Winny. The old&#xD;
lady, who, now that her affections were satisfied&#xD;
with the presence of her "baby," had fallen into&#xD;
that still, smiling, blissful dotage, beautifully&#xD;
termed "second childhood," that state which&#xD;
is neither quite of earth, nor quite of heaven, but&#xD;
seems a happy lingering of the soul between&#xD;
hotly --that loving, lovely close of a long and&#xD;
good earthly career, which is not death, but an&#xD;
easy, gentle~ translation of the soul to God-the&#xD;
old lady was Winny's constant companion.&#xD;
Those three children, 1 mean grandmother,&#xD;
Wiuny, and baby, occupied one room at Red-&#xD;
Stone, and Gelly waited on them. Claude Vel-&#xD;
lemonte often came to visit and cheer them. In&#xD;
Winny, indeed, he found a special object for his&#xD;
life giving mission, and he devoted himself to&#xD;
her with all his cheerful and hearty faith, hope,&#xD;
and charity. Perhaps no one in the world be-&#xD;
sides Claude Vellemonte, could have "minister-&#xD;
~ so successfully to this heart and "mind dim.&#xD;
eased." He had awakened Winny's dormant re-&#xD;
ligious affections, strengthened her faith, and re-&#xD;
vived her hopes; and with that great hygeiange-&#xD;
fame, whose possession had acquired for him,&#xD;
:~a~iong his more simple-minded parishioners, the&#xD;
&#xD;
his own fair creed."&#xD;
When Claude Velletuonte had succeeded in&#xD;
scattering that burning spot in Winny's breast,&#xD;
left by the old wound-when he had raised her&#xD;
spirits, and she was no longer suffering fron&#xD;
pain, or "numbed" by despair, he told her that&#xD;
she must return to her father's house, and take&#xD;
her station daily by his sick bed; and Winny,&#xD;
who ever obeyed his voice, as though her Ba.&#xD;
viour had spoken by his lips, got into a carriage&#xD;
with her grandmother and her baby, and made&#xD;
old Nerve "burst out a-crying" with joy, by&#xD;
getting out of it at the door of Oak Grove Hall.&#xD;
Claude Vellemonte had more than one good rea-&#xD;
son for directing this move, to explain which, I&#xD;
must go back a little.&#xD;
It had not been deemed safe by his physicians&#xD;
to inform Squire Darling of the fate of Sina for&#xD;
som: we4s, although for many reasons, known&#xD;
only to himself, he seemed darkly to suspect it.&#xD;
When at last the manner of her da~ath Was made&#xD;
known to him, he received the news very quiet-&#xD;
ly, merely saying, to himself-" Yee-yes-yes&#xD;
-yes-insanity was hereditary in one branch&#xD;
of her mother's family-her uncle died in the&#xD;
lunatic asylum, and one of her aunts died of a&#xD;
brain fever!" Then he turned his face to the&#xD;
wall, and spoke no more for hours. All that&#xD;
day and night he refused both food and drink,&#xD;
and from that time he sank into deep gloom.&#xD;
"Shall I never, never be happy again ?" said&#xD;
the miserable man, as he tossed and tumbled&#xD;
about, among the bed clothes and pillows.*&#xD;
Old Nerve, who was sitting c9mfortably in a&#xD;
large, soft arm-chair, before th&amp;amp; fire, in her ca-&#xD;
pacity o~ nurse, and occupying herself with&#xD;
toasting her fat feet, and looking atthe pictures&#xD;
in a splendidly bound Bible-a copy utterly for-&#xD;
bidden to vulgar fingers, on account of its splen-&#xD;
dor-now turned her head, and took u long, ex-&#xD;
ceedingly self-complacent look at her master.&#xD;
"Shall I never, never see another happy&#xD;
day ?" groaned the now feverish and excited&#xD;
man.&#xD;
"Never, sarI never! sartain as you're a libin'&#xD;
sinner, 'til you 'solves that farm, as I telled you&#xD;
'fore !-'til you 'solves that farm o' Debil Dar-&#xD;
lin' &amp;amp; Compiny. The 'Compiny' o' the farm is&#xD;
gone, praised be, my blessed 'Deerner I.-. and&#xD;
that ought for to be a~warnin' to you."&#xD;
"Who spoke to you, you in-" faltered the&#xD;
squire, checking, for the first time in hijlife, a&#xD;
profane-word upon his tongue.&#xD;
"Nobody didn't ear, chile, but the spent o'&#xD;
the Lord, an' 'Woe is me if I preaches i~ot the&#xD;
&#xD;
SIIAN NONDALE.&#xD;
&#xD;
gospel.' Can't help of it, master, chile, ef you&#xD;
does git mad-Can't, indeed, honoy-'caze I&#xD;
talks to you fur your own good, an' I tells you&#xD;
again, you won't never be happy on this blessed&#xD;
fruitful yeth 'til you breaks long o' Sam, an'&#xD;
sets out to sarve your 'Vine Marster an' Lord,&#xD;
as any ole gemluin as has come to your time o'&#xD;
life ought for to do l"&#xD;
"Oh, oh, oh!,' groaned the poor man, tossing&#xD;
about his arms.&#xD;
"Yes, honey!' I hopes you's groanin' for your&#xD;
sinr-'deed I does."&#xD;
"Oh! oh! oh!"&#xD;
"Yes, chile, that's right! I hopes you's 'eider-&#xD;
in' now how you's made other people groan-&#xD;
'deed I does, chile !"&#xD;
"You infernal-oh! oh!"&#xD;
C(Ah, Lord, see that, now! when i'm a-pro-&#xD;
phecying of the Bible to him for his own good,&#xD;
-but that's always the way Sam's children&#xD;
talks to the Lord's little ones !-ef he had the&#xD;
power this blessed minute, he'd heave sornethin'&#xD;
at my poor ole head, and split me down! but,&#xD;
praised be my blessed Marster, he ain't got the&#xD;
power; he done stretch out there, an' 'bilge&#xD;
for to hear the truffe now, ef he turned a def&#xD;
year to it all his life before. An' I gwine give&#xD;
it to him good !" said Nerve, in a tone of&#xD;
determination, being-in the full knowledge that&#xD;
her master was entirely in her power-wonder-&#xD;
fully strengthened to preach the Gospel. "Don't&#xD;
you know, you poor ole sinner, as he who 'fends&#xD;
one of the Lord's little ones, had better have a&#xD;
maelstrome strung around his neck, and be hang&#xD;
ed to the top o' the trees? an' ain't .1 one&#xD;
the Lord's little ones as you're fending ' of ?-..&#xD;
Ain't this here persecution ?"&#xD;
Here g pillow Was launched at her head from&#xD;
the hands of the enraged squir-e,.who instantly&#xD;
fell back, exhausted with the effort. Nerve&#xD;
tos-aod up the whites of her eyes, and, crossing&#xD;
herself devoutIy~ejaculated~&#xD;
"Oh, may the Lord 'give this poor ole forsok&#xD;
sinner, and lead him to ~pentance, and not cut&#xD;
hIm off hI his sins. I 'gives you, ole master,&#xD;
chl~e, 'deed 1 does; I 'gives you, an' I pixies of&#xD;
you; an' I heaps coals o' fire on your head I"&#xD;
Oh! oh! oh I"&#xD;
"-They bums, does they?"&#xD;
"You'll .fill me I"&#xD;
"No, I won't, honey; I pasties of you! 'deed I&#xD;
does, chile, an' I takes all your deblish ways in&#xD;
good part!"&#xD;
"Do, oh, do hush-oh! talking-"&#xD;
"I can't, chile; I can't, indeed, honey! I'm&#xD;
a talkiri' to you for your own good I 'deed, 'fore&#xD;
my 'Vine Marster I am, chile! i'm a setting' of&#xD;

may be the Las', so I gwine to 'prove it, an'&#xD;
give it to you good-.."deed I is, chile!"&#xD;
"I'll-oh! oh! i'll-" groaned the highly&#xD;
14&#xD;
&#xD;
181&#xD;
&#xD;
feverish man, tossing about wildly amdng the&#xD;
sheets, and grasping crazily at the pillows.&#xD;
"Well, do, honey! Yes, ole master, do heave&#xD;
the other pillow at my head; do, chile, of It&#xD;
eases of your poor ole conscience any; an' the&#xD;
bolsters, too, honey, an' the counterpane, an'&#xD;
the sheets, chile, of it makes you feel any bet-&#xD;
ter 'bout the heart; dough, ef it don't, 'hape&#xD;
you'd better not tire of yourself."&#xD;
"Oh! oh! I shall-i shall-go distracted!"&#xD;
cried the sick man, with the rising strength of&#xD;
fever&#xD;
"Yes, ole master, honey, you may kick and&#xD;
strain (plunge, struggle,) as much as you please,&#xD;
an' fling your arms an' legs about in that on.&#xD;
decent manner, as no gemman ought for to do&#xD;

do nobody no harm, praised be my blessed Lord,&#xD;

"My God! oh, who will deliver mc-"-&#xD;
"Yes, master, chile, groan, honey, it's good&#xD;

yelled old Nerve, in the strong grasp ot the&#xD;
fever-maddened man, who with the new and ter-&#xD;
rible strength of delirium, had suddenly sprung&#xD;
from his bed, dragging the sheets behind him,&#xD;
and seized his tormentor by the nape of her neck.&#xD;
"Ah-r.r-r-r-r-r-rf f!!'~ yelled Nerves once more&#xD;
extricating herself an instant from his strange.&#xD;
ling fingers. "Oh! praised be my 'Vine Mars-&#xD;
ter. Mr. Vellemonte! is you comed at last,"&#xD;
exclaimed phe, running for shelter into the arms&#xD;
of Claude Vellemonte, who had just then hurried&#xD;
into the room at the .sound of shrieks; "he's!&#xD;
he's got larum-terrors! (delirium-tremens;) he's&#xD;
got larum-terrors! he's got larum-terrors, as&#xD;
use for to follow of him when he was a drinking'&#xD;
man-as sure as he's a livin' sinner, he's got&#xD;
larum-terrors I"&#xD;
"Has he been taking any alcoholic spirits ?"&#xD;
asked Claude Vellemonte, when he had succeed-&#xD;
ed in getting him back to bed, and composing&#xD;
him.&#xD;
-" Sir?"&#xD;
"Has he been drinking?"&#xD;
* "Oh, Lor'! no sir; not a drap-no, sun On'y&#xD;
I was a setting' of his duty afore him, and he hey&#xD;
himself into a passion long o' me, an' fetch on&#xD;

~~What were you doing ?"&#xD;
"A-settin' of his sins afore him, an' a.prophe.&#xD;
cyin' o' the Bible to him-as a faithful sarvint&#xD;
aught for to do.1'&#xD;
"And you raised his fever and fre~zie4 him&#xD;
Nerve, do you want to kill your masteA?"&#xD;
"Me, kill him! Lor' forgive you, Mr. Velie-&#xD;

"Bat you will certainly kill him, if you worry&#xD;
hun so."&#xD;
"I was a preaching' of the gospel to him, surf"&#xD;
"But-as I have warned yost before.-you&#xD;
have no mission, no vocation, for that work."&#xD;
"Bsiz I"&#xD;
"No esacI, then."&#xD;
"Yes, sar-yes-suocation-yes, that's the&#xD;
most genteelest word; nack is rale, down low,&#xD;
poor, white pooplo~s talk; wo-what's it, mars-&#xD;

SIIANNO1~DALE.&#xD;
&#xD;
e~Vocation."&#xD;
"Wocation! yes-thanky, sir! yes-i'll re-&#xD;
memberize it!"&#xD;
"You must remember also, not rashly to han-&#xD;
die holy things, as you do. Nerve, you are a well-&#xD;
meaning woman, if we except a Blight vein of&#xD;
sly malice; and a sensible one, barring an over-&#xD;
weening self-esteem; but you have certainly,&#xD;
nearly killed your master to-day, by preaching&#xD;
out of time and place. 'There is a time for all&#xD;
things,' said the wise man; and the truth is to be&#xD;
spoken 'in love,' said the apostle."&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
"Now, if you will promise never more to&#xD;
speak until I give you leave, I will, on my side,&#xD;
promise, that before the year is out, you and&#xD;
Kill shall be free, with a little house, well fur-&#xD;
nished, and a little plot of ground, with a horse,&#xD;
a cow, pigs, and some poultry."&#xD;
The result of this affair, was, that Claude&#xD;
Vellemonte, on returning to Red-Stone Hall, had&#xD;
first sent Winny, now somewhat recovered, to&#xD;
Oak Grove; and then going to Sacred Heart, had&#xD;
dispatched Harriet Joy as general protector.&#xD;
But Claude Vellemonte had more than one mo-&#xD;
tive for sending Winny to her father, for though&#xD;
it was certain that the fecble-one could do no-&#xD;
thing in the way of nursing him or even sit by&#xD;
his bedside for any great length of time together,&#xD;
yet her attendance there was a duty, and her&#xD;
mere presence bad a salutary effect upon the&#xD;
health of the invalid, and exercised a softening&#xD;
and redeeming influence upon the heart of the&#xD;
father. We know that when he first saw Winny&#xD;
after her illness his heart had melted, and his&#xD;
tears had fallen at the sight of his suffering&#xD;
child; that he might then have been led to re-&#xD;
pent his harshness, had his thoughts not soon&#xD;
been monopolized by the corroding jealousies and&#xD;
anxieties of his absorbing passion for Sinai and&#xD;
his judgment been unduly influenced by that&#xD;
wily girl, who knew, even amid their fierce&#xD;
quarrels, how to turn his anger against Edgm~&#xD;
Ardenne, whom she ever artfully presented to&#xD;
him as a heartless adventurer, who had specula-&#xD;
ted upon his daughter's affections and his own&#xD;
wealth and influence. And ~our honest squire,&#xD;
who had less keenness of perception than via.&#xD;
len~e of temper and stubbornness of will, con-&#xD;
tinued to act upon that view~ of the case up to&#xD;
the time of the catastrophe. But now, under&#xD;
the influen~.e of the discipline of Sina Hinton's&#xD;
awful death, and his own prolonged illness, could&#xD;
he lay there on his bed of slow convalescence,&#xD;
and not be led to deen reflection on the past, or&#xD;
could he turn his eyes to where his daughter sat&#xD;
In her arm-~hair by his bedside and see his pale,&#xD;
suffering, but uncomplaining child, heart-broken&#xD;
by his own harshness, and not wish to bind up&#xD;
that broken heart, and, if possible, to give it&#xD;
happiness?&#xD;

How quiet it was in the sick room on Easter&#xD;
Tuesday morning. A small, bright fire was&#xD;
burning in the grate at the same time that-for&#xD;
the weather was dry, clear and pleasant-the&#xD;
windows were slightly raised and the blinds&#xD;
partly open to let in the fresh and "sunny air."&#xD;
They had done breakfast and the room was&#xD;
made very tidy and cheerful, and the now rapid&#xD;
ly recovering invalid, newly shaved and refiosh.&#xD;
ed, sat in bed propped up with pillows. The old&#xD;
lady placidly smiling to herself, reposed in an&#xD;
easy chair by the fire. While Winny sat by hex&#xD;
father's bedside with her baby sleeping on her&#xD;
lap, as though she had forgotten to lay it down;&#xD;
she was looking at her baby in a pensive, half-&#xD;
abstracted manner. ~he was silent, patient and&#xD;
serene as ever, she had fallen into one of her&#xD;
reveries, and did not know that her father's&#xD;
eyes, full of mournful affection, were gazing on&#xD;
her. Her thoughts were far away. He leaned&#xD;
over and supporting his head upon his hand,&#xD;
while he rested on his elbow, fttretchied his&#xD;
other hand out, and laying it affectionately on&#xD;
her pale, golden hair, said,&#xD;
"Winny, my child f"&#xD;
She looked up.&#xD;
"What are you thinking of, my dear child 1"&#xD;
She dropped her eyelids, and two large tears&#xD;
rolled slowly down her cheeks.&#xD;
"Winny, my child, have you ever heard from&#xD;
Edgar since he went away ?"&#xD;
Now the tears streamed.&#xD;
t~Say, Winny f-I have a reason for asking&#xD;
you, my love."&#xD;
A suffocating sob of-.--&#xD;
"No-never-never once," was the almost&#xD;
unintelligible answer.&#xD;
"Did you love him so dearly then, Winny ?"&#xD;
Her sobs grew now hysterical-she leaned her&#xD;
face down upon the side of the bed.&#xD;
"Don't cry, Winny, my dear, don't cry!"&#xD;
But Winny sobbed the more.&#xD;
"Don't cry, Winny, don't! Affairs are not so&#xD;
desperate as you think may-be, child! Don't&#xD;
cry so much 1"&#xD;
"Father I-let mo-it is thefirst time-I've&#xD;

sled ~ tear-since he went away! You calle&#xD;
him 'Edgar'-kindly-and that-that-touche&#xD;
my heart-and-and-let me cry!" sobbed Win&#xD;
ny, convulsivelywhile the poor father, who couli&#xD;
not guess the good this great thaw of congeale&#xD;
tears was doing her-fretted and fumed. As sooi&#xD;
as Winny could speak she commenced again, an&#xD;
bet~oeen broken sobs said,&#xD;
"Father! forgive-not Atm, for he was not t~&#xD;
blame, but-in., for It was my fault! 1 lovec&#xD;
him so much, so much, so much, father I-fa-&#xD;
ther, forgive me-bless and dismiss me, that&#xD;
may go and seek him!"&#xD;
"Seek him, poor child, do you know where he&#xD;
is 1"&#xD;
"No, father, but God will lead me to him!"&#xD;
")!ou! you, poor, thin, pale thing, that pani&#xD;
when you come up stairs."&#xD;
"God will strengthen me, father! Give me&#xD;
your blessing and let me go I"&#xD;
"Wouldn't it be better to bring Edgar back&#xD;
here ?"&#xD;
"AhI father, if you would-if you would-&#xD;
you would make me 50,50 happy! but, oh! fa-&#xD;
ther! how will you find out where he is ?"&#xD;
"1 know where he is !"&#xD;
"You, father! you know where he is I Oh!&#xD;
father, if you do indeed, for the blessed loving&#xD;
*    Saviour's sake, tell me! tell me!"&#xD;
"He is in the wilds of the North-West Terri-&#xD;
tory, living a hunter's life."&#xD;
"And you will bring him back? Oh, father,&#xD;
you will make your only child happy! you will&#xD;
bring him back!"&#xD;
"1 do not know, my child, just yet, I'll see !"&#xD;
replied the squire, who found magnanimity a&#xD;
new and exceedingly difficult lesson to practice.&#xD;
"Oh I father, you have my life and death in&#xD;
your hands-give me life I"&#xD;
"Winny, my child, hope ali things-this I&#xD;
will tel! you for your comfort. I t~ok you from&#xD;
Pine Cliffs and permitted Edgar Ardenne to leave&#xD;
the State, broken-hearted, because I was justly&#xD;
incensed against you both, and wished to punish&#xD;
you both, as well as to try kim-to test his fideli-&#xD;
ty and integrity. I wasn't sure he was alto-&#xD;
gether evil. Though I disliked him so much,&#xD;
that I cared not the toss up of a penny whether&#xD;
he stood the test or not, yet in the event of his&#xD;
standing it, I was full determined to bring him&#xD;
back to you. I was compelled to be silent as&#xD;
the grave about it, and even act a malignity 1&#xD;
did not always feel, in order to blind people to&#xD;
my thoughts, and give my test a fair chance to&#xD;
work. W ll, I never lost sight (morally speak-&#xD;
ing) of Edgar Ardenne for one hour after he left&#xD;
here, or for one hour since-you know who left&#xD;
in his company.&#xD;
"No, sir."&#xD;
"Willie Smiie, Hettie's cousin, and 1 wrote to&#xD;
him, and have been in secret correspondence&#xD;
with him ever since."&#xD;
&#xD;
O NDALE.&#xD;
f "Oh, father!' -&#xD;
"It is absolutely necessary, my dear! A pen.&#xD;
- niless man who carries off an heiress is an object&#xD;
I of suspicion, and must be submitted to a severe&#xD;
I test before confidence may be safely reposed in&#xD;
him. Well !~ 1 am happy for your sake, Winny,&#xD;
I to say that As has stood the teat-he has been&#xD;
true even to the severe condition that obliged&#xD;
him not to seek a re-union with you."&#xD;
"Father, father! ~,iou compelled him to make&#xD;
- that promise?"&#xD;
"Yes! and then 1 was in earnest-my mote&#xD;
merciful thought was an after thought. Well,&#xD;
Winny, he has stood the severe test, and so, as&#xD;
the devil himself can't unmake him your hus. -&#xD;
band, the father of my grandchild,, and my own&#xD;
son-in-law-perhaps-mind, I say perAGpa- I'll&#xD;
some day write for him to come home."&#xD;
"And 1, father, will never cease to pray you&#xD;
to do so until 1 see my prayers of no avail, and&#xD;
- then, with my baby in my arms, I will go and&#xD;
seek him."&#xD;
While tbis scene was taking place above stairs,&#xD;
another was transpiring below. "Monsieur Le&#xD;
Duc De Vellemonte" had ridden over to Oak&#xD;
Grove, and asked for Harriette Joy, who still&#xD;
remained there as a temporary acting mistress&#xD;
of the house. The news of his change of cir-&#xD;
cumstances had preceded him in a note carried&#xD;
by a messenger from Red-Stone, who, every&#xD;
morning, was dispatched to inquire after the&#xD;
squire's amendment.&#xD;
Claude De Vellemonte was closeted with Har-&#xD;
riette Joy, and his manner was very serious and&#xD;
her eyes were red with weeping. He had been&#xD;
confiding to her Sina's whole secret history.-&#xD;
When he had finished, he said,&#xD;
"And now, knowing that when we bad sup-&#xD;
posed him to be getting well, the news of Miss&#xD;
Hinton's fate threw him back so dangerously, I&#xD;
have been, up to this time, fearful of opening up&#xD;
the subject to Squire Darling again; fraught&#xD;
with so much pain as the story of her perfidy&#xD;
must be. Still, in justice and in mercy to Winny&#xD;
and Edgar Ardenne, he ought very quickly to&#xD;
know how those children were betrayed into&#xD;
marriage byanother~s artful misrepresentations."&#xD;
"You may tell him with safety now, I think;&#xD;
at least it is not right longer to delay," said&#xD;
Harriette, wiping her eyes, and resuming her&#xD;
cheerfulness. "I will go up~and inform him that&#xD;
you are here."&#xD;
And she went.&#xD;
"Yes," said Squire Darling, "let him come&#xD;
in!" and soon after, Claude entered the sick&#xD;
chamber.&#xD;
"I suppose 1 may be permitted to congratulate&#xD;
you upon the happy change in your circumstan-&#xD;
ces, Monsieur Le D;mc De Vellemonte," said the&#xD;
squire, gruffly iii tbA.tone 'f-"l s'pose you&#xD;
&#xD;
SHANNO;&#xD;
think yourself a very importantpersonage-who&#xD;
the d-l gave you leave to be any happier than&#xD;
any body else ?"&#xD;
"Thank you, squire. Wish me joy of a hap-&#xD;
pier coming event-my approaching union with&#xD;
your niece, Miss Su~nmerfield."&#xD;
"Ah, indeed! When is that to come off 1"&#xD;
"Our marriage is delayed by circumstances&#xD;
over which you yourself have the greatest con-&#xD;
trol. Your own restoration to health, and-par-&#xD;
don me-the re-union of Winny and Edgar Ar-&#xD;
"Father Vellemonte I-I beg your forgiveness,&#xD;
Monsieur Le Duc-I am not-because I happen&#xD;
to have been ill-grown feeble as a child, to be&#xD;
tutored by all around me I" said the squire, in&#xD;
an irritated tone; for like all other rather weak-&#xD;
minded persons, he was very much afraid of ha-&#xD;
ving it supposed that he could be influenced.&#xD;
"1 do not presume to wish to tutor you, my&#xD;
good sir; 1 have only certain revelations to make&#xD;
that will throw a new light upon that affair of&#xD;
the elopement."&#xD;
"Revelations! Humph!it seems to me that&#xD;
you have become a book of Revelations 1"&#xD;
"Are you strong enough to hear a somewhat&#xD;
tedious story V'&#xD;
"Don't know, indeed, Father Vellemonte-&#xD;
beg your pardon, Monsieur Le Duc 1"&#xD;
"I will make it short as possible, then," said&#xD;
Claude, with unruffled serenity, and forthwith&#xD;
commenced giving him the whole history of the&#xD;
runaway match.&#xD;
Squire Darling listened with unusual self-&#xD;
command, only ejaculating "Humph I" and&#xD;
"Ah I" at certain points. He showed not&#xD;
much pain at the discovery of Miss Hinton's&#xD;
perfidy; for, in reality, his quandom passion for&#xD;
Sina was of that nature which required the pre-&#xD;
tence of its object to -excite it; and now, be.&#xD;
tween the loss of her presence and his own ill-&#xD;
ness, it became to him only as the memory of a&#xD;
severe fever. He listened to this secret history&#xD;
with some degree of satisfaction. He began to&#xD;
feel a wish, and, indeed, a positive necessity of&#xD;
recalling Ardenne, and he wanted very much a&#xD;
plausible excuse for relenting. A feeling more&#xD;
lively than this mere satisfaction, an emotion of&#xD;
generous regret, and a wish to compensate the&#xD;
boy and girl he had so deeply injured, crossed&#xD;
his mind, and impelled him to exclaim,&#xD;
"By Heaven! there - are ~not reams of paper&#xD;
enough in all Jefferson county for me to write&#xD;
to Edgar on!" but instantly, angry with him-&#xD;
self for this escapade, he relapsed into more&#xD;
than usual sullenness of silence, and heard the&#xD;
story to an end with a solitary "Bumphl" at its&#xD;
conclusion- Then, when, after silently await-&#xD;
ing his comments for awhile, Claude ventured to&#xD;
inquire concerning his probable course of action,&#xD;
he said, importantly,&#xD;
"This matter requires mature deliberation,&#xD;
&#xD;
~DALE.                                165&#xD;
Father Vellemonte-I beg your pardon, Mon-~&#xD;
siour Le Duc I"&#xD;
1 am afraid, reader, you do not do half justice&#xD;
to the goodness that dwelt in Harriette Joy's&#xD;
merry heart. She was waiting on the steps for&#xD;
Claude when he came down.&#xD;
"And so you could get nothing out of him,"&#xD;
she said, when Claude had told her the resu1~V&#xD;
his visit.&#xD;
"He takes time for mature deliberation."&#xD;
"Yes~ A judge taking time for mature deli-&#xD;
beration as to whether he will pardon, or not,&#xD;
and when, and bow far, while the culprits are&#xD;
bound upon the rack. This must be put a stop&#xD;
tot I will go myself and talk to him I Be is&#xD;
fond of me. I-will go and coax him."&#xD;
"Do not go, my dear Harriette, to-day; he is&#xD;
too much excited, and I am afraid of a return of&#xD;
fever, therefore heft him so suddenly. Go to-&#xD;
morrow morning, my dear child," said Clabde&#xD;
Vellemonte, squeezing Harriette's hand, and&#xD;
leaving her.&#xD;
"I will go up and stay with your father,&#xD;
Winny, dear, while you and grandmother&#xD;
(Harry, since coming to the house, had always&#xD;
affectionately called the old lady grandmother,)&#xD;
eat breakfast," said Harriette, the next morn-&#xD;
ing, and accordingly she ran up stairs and enters-&#xD;
ed the squire's room. He was up now, and&#xD;
seated in a crimson damask arm-chair by the&#xD;
fire. He was dressed In a blue velvet dressing- ~&#xD;
gown, and a many-colored Chinese night-cap.&#xD;
And by his side stood a nice little mahogany&#xD;
stand covered with a white cloth, and an eb.gant&#xD;
litle breakfast service for one person. Nerve&#xD;
was standing waiting on him.&#xD;
"Will you take some breakfast, Miss Harry?"&#xD;
cheerfully inquired the squire.&#xD;
"Indeed, I'm afraid there's not enough for&#xD;
yourself," laughed Harriette.&#xD;
"I do not, in fact, know that there will be&#xD;
enough for teuo, since the second one is little&#xD;
Nimrod; indeed; I half repent my invitation-&#xD;
say 'no, thank you,' Miss Barry I"&#xD;
"No, thank you, sir; I came up only to wait&#xD;
on you. Nerve, go down and nurse the baby!"&#xD;
"Nuss the baby! I think its'bout time I'd&#xD;
done o' that there," said Nerve, grumbling, but&#xD;
obeying.&#xD;
Harriette had chosen her time well-when re-&#xD;
freshed by a good night's sleep, and by his bath1&#xD;
Squire Darling "newly shaved-fresh as a bride-&#xD;
groom," sat in his handsome dressing-gown and&#xD;
cap, in his large, easy chair, bythe genial, bright&#xD;
fire, enjoying all the creature comforts with the&#xD;
infinite, the Ineffable gusto of a conxslescent.&#xD;
Barry went at her innocent flattering with little&#xD;
tact. She buttered his buckwheats for him-&#xD;
kept alive the fire in the chafing-dish under ~ls:&#xD;
venison steak, and cut of the ebolde pis. ~&#xD;

laid on his plate. And finallyafter he had eaten&#xD;
and lingered long over a very hearty breakfast,&#xD;
she lighted his meerachaum and handed to him-&#xD;
rolling away the stand at the same time. But&#xD;
~Aeu Harry, the transparent little hypocrite, eat&#xD;
dew on a low stool close by his side, and lean-&#xD;
ing her elbows on the arm of his chair, rested&#xD;
nor chin upon the palms of both hands, and look-&#xD;
~ up in hi. face, very sweetly informed him&#xD;
she loved the fragrant smoke of the meer-&#xD;
schaum better than any perfume in the world!&#xD;
Ahi Miss Harry! this coaxing and flattering an&#xD;
old gentleman of Squire Darling's kith, is not the&#xD;
wisest thing in the world-as you will presently&#xD;
livid to your cost. She liked tobacco smoke bet-&#xD;
ter than anything in the world! The mendacious&#xD;
little sinner! Squire Darling, himself, was not&#xD;
to be gulled by that very flimsy piece of deceit!&#xD;
He took his pipe out of his mouth, and looking&#xD;
down at her with an affectionate archness, said,&#xD;
"God Almighty bless you, Harriette I you can&#xD;
~ more play a part than the simplest infant!"&#xD;
Harriette dropped her eyelids, blushed deeply,&#xD;
and looked intensely mortified at the idea of&#xD;
being thought incapable of deceit.&#xD;
"Well, what is it, Miss Harry? for, of course,&#xD;
all this wheedling means that you want some-&#xD;
thing of me!"&#xD;
"Yes, I do," said Harriette, in a low tone,&#xD;
"but it was not for'myself."&#xD;
"Of course it was not-who ever heard of&#xD;
you're ever saying, doing, or thinking anything&#xD;
~ fbr yourself. God bliss little Nirnrod! How&#xD;
refreshing a good girl is," said the squire, pat-&#xD;
ting her black, curly haired head approvingly,&#xD;
and stroking down her damask cheek. "Now&#xD;
what is it, Harriette, for, be sure, there is a&#xD;
good chance of your suit being gained-there are&#xD;
few things I could refuse little Nimrod."&#xD;
"Then I wish, if you please-I should be so&#xD;
thankful to you if you would-would----would not&#xD;
be so extremely hard-hearted and cruel to poor&#xD;
dear Edgar and Whiny!"&#xD;
"'Hard-hearted and cruel,' humpht Your&#xD;
manner of advocating a cause should immorta-&#xD;
lize you as a diplomatist, Miss Harry!" dryly&#xD;
commented the squire. "Well, I spose that's&#xD;
wholesome truth, and no flattery," he added,&#xD;
mentally-then speaking aloud to Harriette, he&#xD;
said, "Well, what am I to do."&#xD;
"Deal justly by them, sir !"&#xD;
"Humph! there it is again! no appeal to-&#xD;
well! it's well i'm inclined to favor her peti-&#xD;
tion," thought the squire, and then he said,&#xD;
"And if I do, Miss Harry, what then ?"&#xD;
"Oh, sir! they will be so very happy ?"&#xD;
"And I?"&#xD;
"Oh, sir! never mind about you&#xD;
"The d-l."&#xD;
"1 mean, sir, that there is nothing to disturb&#xD;
your, happiness, and that we are not anxious on&#xD;

&#xD;
"Humphi but I should be alone."&#xD;
"You would have the company of your daugh-&#xD;
ter and son-in-law, and their child, or children,&#xD;
sir!"&#xD;
"Oh! my daughter and son-in-law-they will&#xD;
be absorbed in each other--and as for their&#xD;
child, or children-ain't you ashamed, Miss&#xD;
Harry, by the way, to be speculating upon conse-&#xD;
quences 1 1 am not fond of babies."&#xD;
"Well, sir, at least you will have-"&#xD;
"I will have nothing!" said the squire, "and&#xD;
the fact is, that~I am not going to sacrifice my-&#xD;
self for undutiful children."&#xD;
"Oh, sir! you-"&#xD;
"1 WON'T! D- if I do!" exclaimed the&#xD;
squire, who was in one of his wilful moods, and&#xD;
wished to torment Harriette-whose want of&#xD;
diplomacy had certainly contributed to raise the&#xD;
present perverse spirit.&#xD;
"No, d- it I do!" repeated the squire.&#xD;
Harriette coaxed, entreated, wrung her hands,&#xD;
wept.&#xD;
"No, d- if I do !" was all the satisfaction&#xD;
she got.&#xD;
Harry renewed her coaxing, entreating, and&#xD;
weeping. In vain.&#xD;
"No, d- if 1 do !" was the finale.&#xD;
"Oh, mercy!" said Harriette, "I tbo'ight you&#xD;
had repented; I thought you were going to re-&#xD;
form! and here you are, as wicked as ever, and&#xD;
swearing as hard as ever!"&#xD;
"When the devil got sick, the devil a saint would be;&#xD;
When the devil got well, the devil a saint was he!"&#xD;
"Oh, indeed it is too shocking to hear you-&#xD;
and I am going away, Squire Darling," said&#xD;
Harry, "more in sorrow than in £nger," rising&#xD;
to depart.&#xD;
"Come back,~ little Nimrod-' thou almost&#xD;
persuades me to be a Christian.' Come back,&#xD;
little girl."&#xD;
"No, Squire Darling, I will not come back-&#xD;
you distress me too much!" said Harry, deeply&#xD;
wounded to see one who should be a father in&#xD;
Israel, acting and talking with so much irreve-&#xD;
rence and profanity.&#xD;
"Come back, little Nimrod; I have somewhat&#xD;
to say to thee concerning Edgar a~d Winny !"&#xD;
"Well, sir!" said Harriette, returning.&#xD;
"It seems to me, you have abandoned their&#xD;
cause very rashly," said the squire, who, after&#xD;
all, liked well to be coaxed by her.&#xD;
At it Harriette went again with all her might&#xD;
and main.&#xD;
"You say you love Winny, sir! Ah! you&#xD;
cannot I If you did, you would sacrificeany selfish&#xD;
feeling for hersake."&#xD;
"Do you love Winny, little Nimrod ?"&#xD;
"Ak, ask Winny if I do not, sir !"&#xD;
"Then you would be willing to do a great&#xD;
deal for her sake!"&#xD;
"Tryine, sir!"&#xD;
&#xD;
"It is in your power to make her happy!"&#xD;
"How, sir I"&#xD;
"By re-uniting her snd her husband."&#xD;
"1 guessed that much, sir, fot that only woulc&#xD;
make her happy-nothing else certainly would&#xD;
I mean how is it in my power?"&#xD;
"You can purchase their pardon."&#xD;
"How, sir? I say again."&#xD;
"Will you promise to do anything I wish you&#xD;
to do-if I promise to pardon them, and recall&#xD;
Edgar?"&#xD;
"Yes, the Lord hears me! I will, sir!" said&#xD;
the rash and unsuspicious girl.&#xD;
"Anything!"&#xD;
"Any thing on earth, sir, in the range of my&#xD;
power."&#xD;
"Hem!" Come closer to me, Harr~ot. You&#xD;
are a dear, honest, large-hearted child! Ho~v&#xD;
nice it would be to have you always here, and&#xD;
be sure that I should not have some fine fellow&#xD;
walking around, and carrying you off some day I&#xD;
as was the case with Winny. Harriette, my&#xD;
dear," he said, stealing his arm around hex&#xD;
waist, and drawing her up to his side-" are you&#xD;
engaged ?"&#xD;
"Encaged, how sir ?"&#xD;
"To be married, I mean!"&#xD;
"No, sir."&#xD;
"Well, then, Harriette, it most assuredly is&#xD;
in your puwer to effect a reconciliation between&#xD;
me and Edgar Ardenne I" said he, giving her a&#xD;
squeeze&#xD;
"I do not comprehend you, sir," observed&#xD;
Harriette, in a low voice, with a rising color.&#xD;
"You do! you little rogue I" giving her ano-&#xD;
ther squeeze.&#xD;
"I want to go to breakfast, Squire Darling!"&#xD;
sai4 Harriette, flushing with embarrassment be-&#xD;
tween her disagreeable position and her dislike&#xD;
of hurting his feelings.&#xD;
"So you shall, in a moment; butyon promised&#xD;
to be mediator between me and Edgar."&#xD;
"Yes-well! if you want me to give you a&#xD;
ki~s-why as it is you-I'll give you two, if&#xD;
you'll oriiy let me go now and carry some com-&#xD;
fort to Winny."&#xD;
"Ah! Harriette, I want to marry you."&#xD;
"You are making fun of me, Squire Darling,"&#xD;
said Harriette, growing pale.&#xD;
"I have too earnest and sincere an esteem for&#xD;
you, Rarriette, to 'make fun' of you. I want&#xD;
youto promise yourself to me, on condition of&#xD;
my xnaking Edgar and Winny, whom you love,&#xD;
happy I"&#xD;
Harriette was silent~&#xD;
"Come, what do you say?"&#xD;
" say you are not in earnest, Squire Darling;&#xD;
ani that the conversation distresses me-ez-&#xD;
trestely "&#xD;
"Before Heaven, I am in earnest in what I am&#xD;
about to declare to you-namely, that~ou shall&#xD;
never draw fro~.n me apardovz for these ilj~rn,&#xD;
&#xD;
until you promise to give me your hand in mar-&#xD;
riage-and that as soon as you will give me that&#xD;
promise, I will dictate a letter that you shall&#xD;
I write to Edgar Ardenne, recalling him to Oak&#xD;
I Grove! Come, will you be generous-will you&#xD;
be magnanimous-will you be self-sacrificing l~,&#xD;
"To your own children, you will certainly be&#xD;
magnanimous, sir!"&#xD;
"Will I? Humph I I never professed to une~&#xD;
1 derstand that branch of Ethics-and I swear to&#xD;
you, that 1 will never grant your petition for&#xD;
I their pardon, until you grant my petition for&#xD;
your hand."&#xD;
A profound sigh from Harriette, who dropped&#xD;
her head upon her bosom, was the only answer.&#xD;
"And I say that the very hour you promise&#xD;
me your hand, I will write to Edgar. Comet&#xD;
what do you say to that ?"&#xD;
"I say, sir, that I cannot see any good reason&#xD;
why their happiness should depend upon your&#xD;
possessing my hand," said Harry, looking down&#xD;
piteously at the threatened digits.&#xD;
"What! see no reason? I'll tell you then!&#xD;
If Winny and Edgar are re-united, I shall be&#xD;
very lonesome, and need a companion; and I&#xD;
want you.~~&#xD;
A deeper sigh from Harriette followed.&#xD;
All this time, with his arm around her waist&#xD;
he held her close to his side.&#xD;
"Come, Harriette, have you never heard the&#xD;
old ladies say, 'lt's better to be an old man's&#xD;
darling than a young man's slave?"'&#xD;
"No, sir! I never heard any body but old&#xD;
gentleman say that!&#xD;
"But you can't deny that it is better to be en&#xD;
old man's darling than a young man's slave."&#xD;
"Yes, I can and do, Squire Darling, for in the&#xD;
latter case, at least, one might be able to love&#xD;
their master, which would make the slavery&#xD;
sweet, you know; and then, sir, there is such a&#xD;
thing as being a young man's darling, and an old&#xD;
man's slave, which is not only very much more&#xD;
horrible, but very much more likely to be the&#xD;
case I"&#xD;
"That is very severe! Pray, what is your&#xD;
reason for thinking so ?"&#xD;
"That as a general thing there is too much&#xD;
sympathy between the young to permit them to&#xD;
tyrannize over each other much."&#xD;
"You think, then, it is impossible for a young&#xD;
woman really to love an elderly man well enough&#xD;
to marry him?"&#xD;
"Nay! I do not sayso; lonlysayitisim..&#xD;
possible for me. Let us drop the conversation,&#xD;
Squire Darling."&#xD;
"By no means, till you decide, for happine.&#xD;
or misery, the fate of Winny and Edgar, whom&#xD;
you profess to love so well 1"&#xD;
"Oh! sir, you will not affliet~me with this&#xD;

and generous impulses, she bounced back into her to her own beating heart, and breathlessly&#xD;

there is no constancy in any of them, till they&#xD;

"Constancy," Harriette smiled to herself. One month after this event, Claude Vellemonte&#xD;

&#xD;
after witnessing the marriage, she found a letter&#xD;
waiting br her. It was post-marked "Win&#xD;
I chester," and directed in a familiar hand. Ear-&#xD;
riette's head swam, and her ey~ s filmed over an&#xD;
instant, as she took it and sank into a chair to&#xD;
read it. When she had finished, the letter drop-&#xD;
ped from her hands, her face fell upon her palms,&#xD;
and quick tears trickled through her fingers&#xD;
Squire Darling was watching her. Now he' laid&#xD;
aside his paper, took up the letter, and asked,&#xD;
"Harriette, what's the matter-may I read&#xD;
this 'U,&#xD;
"Yes, sir, and answer it, please," and she&#xD;
wiped her eyes and smiled.&#xD;
Squire Darling turned the letter to read it. It&#xD;
was a long, long epistle, full of history, meta-&#xD;
physics, inner lifefascination, moral light, expla-&#xD;
nations, protestations. etc.,for four closely written&#xD;
and crossed'foolscap pages; the object of it being&#xD;
to persuade Harriette Joy that Henry Lee Dan-&#xD;
gerlield, amid all the vacillations of his heart,&#xD;
turned at last to her, "true as the needle to the&#xD;
pole," and ending with an offer of his hand and&#xD;
heart, imploring a speedy answer. Squire Dar-&#xD;
ling, with his spectacles on his nose, and one~&#xD;
short, fat leg crossed over the other, leaned back&#xD;
in 'his chair and read this lengthy piece of&#xD;
logic, passion and metaphysics, with many a&#xD;
"Humph!"* and "Ha!" and "Fudge!" and&#xD;
"Trumpery!" Then he folded up the letter and&#xD;
deposited it in his coat pocket, uncrossed his&#xD;
knees, took oil his specs, and looking at Earn-&#xD;
ette, said,&#xD;
"Now, do you know what the vernacular of&#xD;
this grandiloquence is? Just this, Harry, my&#xD;
dear! As he can't get Imogene, or-hem I-&#xD;
he'll take you! don't you see it?"&#xD;
"No, sir, I don't! I think in his heart he liked&#xD;
me better than either of the other two I"&#xD;

to be fooled!"&#xD;
"Well! any how, it does not signify now~ sir;&#xD;

"But I am to answer this letter ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir, if you please."&#xD;
"What must I say ?"&#xD;

you please."&#xD;
"That's a wide margin-I will."&#xD;

Two weeks passed agreeably'enough to all the&#xD;
dwellers at Red-Stone Hall and Oak Grove.&#xD;
&#xD;
169&#xD;
&#xD;
Monsieur and Madame do Vellemcinte were yet&#xD;
at Red-Stone. Harriette Joy still at Oak Grove.&#xD;
Squire Darling, who never did anything by&#xD;
halves, either in the way of falling out or of ma-&#xD;
king up with a friend, had availed himself of his&#xD;
first strength In this fine 3une weather, to go on&#xD;
a journey to meet Edgar Ardenne, who was on his&#xD;
.way returning from the West Sammie Smnilie was&#xD;
staying at Oak Grove, during the absence of the&#xD;
proprietor, as a sort of general supervisor of the&#xD;
premises, and protectorofthewomen. Rettie Smi-&#xD;
lie, the faithful companion of Winny in joy as in&#xD;
sorrow, was there also, up to her eyes in confec-&#xD;
tionary and pastry cooking. Hettie had her&#xD;
own little private joys, hopes and expectati.ns-&#xD;
had not her father sworn off from drinking?-&#xD;
was not Willie Smille-Cousin Willie, coming&#xD;
home with Edgar Ardenne? and when he came,&#xD;
was not somebody to be married and go to house-&#xD;
keeping at that dear old Pine Cliffs, which was&#xD;
newly repaired and neatly furnished by Squirts&#xD;
Darling? AhI Hettie tripped about, thinki4-&#xD;
this a very bright world after all is said! Harri-&#xD;
ette Joy was to be married when they returned,&#xD;
but no preparations for that event especially&#xD;
were on foot. It seemed to have been tacitly&#xD;
arranged that her wedding should come off&#xD;
quietly, and her position in the household be&#xD;
that of an upper housekeeper. And Harriette,&#xD;
who had no time to think about it, and no talent&#xD;
for making herself an object of compassion, never&#xD;
said a word; but ran about very busy and merry,&#xD;
exhorting, commanding, entreating the servants,&#xD;
and superintending a general cleaning, polishing,&#xD;
and embellishing the house, against Edgar came.&#xD;
The bloom of hope had returned to Winny's&#xD;
heart, and the rose of health to her cheek; and&#xD;
ig ever Harriette betrayed any emotion, it was&#xD;
one of pleasure, as she would stop in her flitting&#xD;
hither and thither, and catching Winny to her&#xD;
bosom, kiss her blushing cheek. She was so&#xD;
happy in Winny! One injunction she had laid&#xD;
on Squire Darling with the force of a command&#xD;
-that he should keep them advised of his pro-&#xD;
gress towards home, and send a messenger a few&#xD;
hours in advance, so that Winny's fragile nerves&#xD;
might be shaken as little as possible. The squire&#xD;
had promised this.&#xD;
At length, early one morning, as the old lady,&#xD;
Winny, Harriette and Hettie were sitting at&#xD;
breakfast together, a horseman rode up to the&#xD;
house, and dismounting, entered the hall, and&#xD;
handed a letter to Harriette. It was from Squire&#xD;
Darling, and ran thus-&#xD;

Works by Alexander Dumas.&#xD;
ROSA WOODVILLE; OR, THE J&amp;amp;ILOR'S DAUGHTER.&#xD;
TRANSLATED BY FAYETT~ ROBINSON, ESQ.&#xD;
Price 60 Cents,&#xD;
A brilliant Rom~uce, and one which will fascinate the reader equally with" ~onto Cristo" and "The Three&#xD;
Guard~men." Our skillful author here presents the public with a tale whose s~xtraosdTnary iotere4 will take&#xD;
it by surprise. The narrative is a perfect running fige of incidents, wrought out with an energy, piquancy and&#xD;
power which keep the readerAa a constant whirl of breathless excitement from the first page to t~e last.&#xD;
Love, mystery, Intrigue and adventure are mingled with an intricacy which, in the opinion of the 'bader,&#xD;
must puzzle even the s.~izard pen of Dumas himself to unravel. Nevertheless it is unraveled, and thah~with&#xD;
a delicacy and naturalness which smite the reader with the most profound, and at the same time th&amp;amp;aooat&#xD;
agreeable, astonishment. It is utterly impossible to commence the perusal of this work and lay it aside&#xD;
without finishing it.&#xD;
THE YOUNG CHEVALIER OR, THE DISPUTED INHERITANCE.&#xD;
TRANSLATED BY THOS. WILLIAMS, EBQ.&#xD;
Price 60 cents.&#xD;
Park Benjamin, in speaking of this celebrated author, says:&#xD;
DusW has all th~prigbtlineasof Paul De Igock, without his vulgarity; all the fervor of Sue, without&#xD;
his boast; all the picturesque powerof Ilaizac, without his obseu~ity. His invention Is never-failing; his&#xD;
wit is ~er fertile and ready. You read and marvel at his facility and copiousness; at his fancy, humor,&#xD;
strength~ : you are always diverted; you never yawn; you never say, 'Confound the fellow, why does he prose&#xD;
after this fashion?' He never roses; he Is like an accepted lover, always agreeable.&#xD;

Eugene Sue's Gei&amp;amp;brated Novels.&#xD;
THE FRENCH FORTUNE TELLER; OB.~ THE KY~TERIOU8 STRANGER.&#xD;
Price 60 cents.&#xD;
This is one of those lively and spirited Romances of PirenchIlfe and Intrigue which Sue l~ so famous for&#xD;
portraying. His "Mysteries of Paris' has immortalized him, and this story is quite as good. The characters&#xD;
are vividly drawn, and sustained throughout with striking fidelity. The portrait of ANATALD, a cold, specious,&#xD;
ambitious intriguer, for example, is rendered with an impressive faithfelness, which, once read, can never be&#xD;
obliterated from the memory. The character of the beautiful DuNn Is a brilliant yet melancholy likeness&#xD;
of the easy virtue wl~ich marked the female representatives of the proud, wealthy aii~ corrupt upper classes&#xD;
of her day. The touching history of poor MARIA FavzAu-a type of the fairer portion pf the Bes*rgeoise-wlll&#xD;
be read with mournful interest, affording as it does a vivid contrast between the nm~oralA of the upper and&#xD;
middling ranks, end the utter want of protection which virtue, when allied to beauty, has in the Trench metro-&#xD;
polls, against the lechery of aristocratic libertines.&#xD;
THE WIDOW'S WAL1~; OR THE MYSTERY OF CR1~E.&#xD;
WITH NUMliItOUS ILLUSTRATIONS.&#xD;
Price 26 cents.&#xD;
This Is one of hi. Sue's ingenious tales of the mysteries of everyday life in a great city. The scene is 0!&#xD;
course laid in Paris, and tIme story will give the reader an insight into the private life of the honored and&#xD;
distinguished, the wealthy and pious. and also the horrible rascals of that vast metropolis. tn the course of&#xD;
this great romance, Sue, (while lie adds much to the interest of the plot,) exposes the causes which drive so&#xD;
many thousands of the men of Paris to gambling, robberyand the galleys, and womra to prostitution and the&#xD;
Morgue. While It is entirely free from any offensive thoughts or language, it unveils the terrible social&#xD;
evils that exist in French society.&#xD;
THE MYSTERIES OF THE PEOPLE.&#xD;
IIY ZUGIINE SUE.&#xD;
Author of "The Mysteries of Paris," etc. 1 vol., paper, containing 194 pages closely printed.&#xD;
1'rlce 60 cents.&#xD;
So admirably written in this Incomparable book, that all th&amp;amp;vigilitnce of the French spIes and police hav*&#xD;
been unable to prevent the circulation of i~milIions of copies in every department of France.&#xD;
Sue has given us, in the above powerful romance, another vivid and startling picture of the sufferings and&#xD;
struggles which aristocracies entail upon the peopLe. The work abounds in incident, and is rc.iplete with inter-&#xD;
est from the opening chapter to the close. The oliaracters are dl~amvu and sustaimied throughout with spirit&#xD;
and fidelity. The action is rapid, and the story absorbingly intense. Rarely have we perused a volume which&#xD;
had for us so deep an interest. It fascinates the senses, like a beautiful woman, and gives the reader no rest&#xD;
till he has completed the story.&#xD;

This work is the life of a poor rope-maker and his daughter, struding against poverty and misfortune.&#xD;
The daughter is beautiful, modest; and captivating. Sir Edward Lee, the great man of the book, notwithstand-&#xD;
ing wife and daughters~ falls in love with ~lien Gile~, and concocts a plan to carry the unwilling maid away&#xD;
To do this he employs a villain, with whose real character lie is unhappily unacquainted, and who wishes&#xD;

counterplots, in which the rope-maker and unsuspecting daughter are the victims. The delineations of char-&#xD;
acter arc excellent; Ben Burst, Mine host of Fallow Deer Ins, ~he Gipsy encampment, and Jeal, the Gipsy's&#xD;
