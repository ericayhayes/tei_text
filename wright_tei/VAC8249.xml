on foot, on horseback, in wagons, and, still more incre-.&#xD;
dible, in wheelbarrows. Now, to, go to California is an&#xD;
every-day affair, too tame even to produce excitement.&#xD;
Ho! then, for the rock-bound shores of Patagonia ; the&#xD;
diamond beds and gold placers of the old Incas lie in&#xD;
your way.&#xD;
But the Far West, at that period of which we are now&#xD;
writing, was the beautiful cane land discovered by Ken-&#xD;
ton and Boone; the loved hunting-ground of the north-&#xD;
ern and southern Indians, the dark and bloody territory,&#xD;
the far-famed Kentucky.&#xD;
Those were stirring times in the history of our old&#xD;
Commonwealth, the last years of the 18th century ; and&#xD;
were noted in legend and story, for thrilling and daring&#xD;
adventures, and bloody border strife. It was "the battle-&#xD;
field of barbarism and civilization.&#xD;
Brave men were our sires; and noble and well did.&#xD;
they sustain our time-honored Saxon name; and proudly&#xD;
and sternly did those old pioneers meet the fierce beasts&#xD;
of the forest, and the still more savage and determined&#xD;
Indian..&#xD;
But Boone and Kenton had. wandered over the rich&#xD;
pastures of the West; had met the bear in his lonely den;&#xD;
had' stricken doWn the mighty buffalo upon the fkowery&#xD;
savanna; had stalked the wild -deer and elk through&#xD;
the waving: forest, and,1eturning home, had painted with&#xD;
tarmned eloquence, the lovely luxuriance of the "dis-&#xD;
puted grounds;" and this was enough, moe'than enough,&#xD;
to: hurry farther and still farther westward, the adventu-&#xD;
rous borderers of Virginia and Carolina.&#xD;
Their faces once turned towards the setting .sun, our&#xD;
fatheneve looked back. Treading the trackless forest,&#xD;
they bredted the floods; inset with brave hets the ele-&#xD;
ments, the seasons, The wily savage, and trying priva-&#xD;
tions of a frontier life, bidding defiance to every danger&#xD;
and -difficulty,' ind at last, in spite of, all opposition, were&#xD;
conquerors.&#xD;
Yetgin this mighty and eventful strugglQ for empire,&#xD;
the eorly pioneer suffered not a little. Many of them fell&#xD;

&#xD;
beneath the destroying hand of disease, and not a few by&#xD;
the bullet and steel of their determined foe.&#xD;
Go ask yon smiling valley,&#xD;
Whose harvest blooms so fair-&#xD;
'Twill tellthee a sad story&#xD;
Of the brave who slumber there.&#xD;
Go ask yon mountain, rearing&#xD;
Its forest crest s0 high-&#xD;
Each tree upon its summit&#xD;
Has seen a warrior die.&#xD;
But in every controversy between barbarism and civil-&#xD;
ization, wherever civilized man once plants his foot, the&#xD;
power of the savage is gone. forever.&#xD;
So it was' in the settlement of Kentucky; and though&#xD;
a 'hundred well-fought fields told the fierce determination&#xD;
of the Indians to defend to the last their loved-hunting-&#xD;
ground from the inroads of the Long-knife, still, Adieb were&#xD;
compelled, in the .end, to lower the tomahawk, a  ield&#xD;
to the hardihood and indomitable energy of their 'ally&#xD;
brave, and more skilful Saxon foe.&#xD;
Eut it ,was- a gallant contest-that long- and blood&#xD;
struggle of the Shawanee, Delaware, and' Wyandot, it&#xD;
our fathei§, for the "disputed territory."  We can but&#xD;
admire -thigir -chivalrous daring and bravery, though,&#xD;
whilst adiring, we have to mourn the loss of many of&#xD;
our race, ftd1h under the gleaming axe and knife.&#xD;
Kentucky as strange as it may appear, although a vast&#xD;
and fertile, r1on, abounding with every species of game,&#xD;
was never sted by any of the Indian tribes, but -as&#xD;
held in e  nion, as a mighty huntring-ground, by the&#xD;
Cherokeesp reeks, and Catawbas of the South, and the&#xD;
Shawanees Delawares, and Wyandots of the North.&#xD;
It was  famed land to them al, the daputed terri-&#xD;
tory;" a 'kind of Castle Dangerous, where'the young&#xD;
braves-went forth to kill the deer and the buffalo; and,&#xD;
like the tilting border knights of Enghd and Scotland,&#xD;
met each' other in bloody conflict. Hence, it becae  as&#xD;
dear to them, and as famous, in their war asogs and d dances,&#xD;

&#xD;
they loved it well, for it was enriched by their blood,&#xD;
and was the common and' honored grave of their bravest&#xD;
warriors.&#xD;
The braves, both of the North and South, considered&#xD;
4the luxuriant, flower-bedecked, and game-covered plains&#xD;
of Kentucky, as their common hunting-ground and battle=&#xD;
field; and here were they accustomed, not only to gather&#xD;
food for their lodges, but t6 seize with bold hand the&#xD;
reeking scalp-lock, and .bear it away, the bloody, but&#xD;
triumphant memento cf their prowess.&#xD;
But when the adventurous whites,incited by the glow-.&#xD;
ing descriptions of Boone and his contemporaries, wan-&#xD;
dered over the Blue Ridge, or dropped down the lucid&#xD;
waters of the Belle River, building their camp fires upon&#xD;
this hitherto unsettled land, and driving, with reckless&#xD;
indifference, their axes into the unscarred giants of the&#xD;
forest; the savage of the Miami; and the Creeks 'and,&#xD;
Cherokees of the South, aike forgot their 'ent enmity,&#xD;
and turned, with bloodth sty zeal and un rgfyig ha-&#xD;
tred, against their common foe.&#xD;
The Moslem-defeated, and the royal banner of Richard,&#xD;
the lion-hearted, waved Against the lily of France and&#xD;
double-headed eagle of Austria; but let the descent ap-&#xD;
pear-on the distant horizon, and they wer' all brothers,&#xD;
again, and soldiers of the cross. So it wad with the In-&#xD;
dian  Before the pale-faced hunter pursued the red deer&#xD;
along the shady paths of their common htting-ground,&#xD;
they.fought with each other; but when th destroyer of&#xD;
their race came, they buried the tomahawk, 'au&amp;amp;turned all&#xD;
their energies to the destruction of the Longknife.&#xD;
And thatlast stand of the~ retreating sa  e, against&#xD;
the enproa1gi tread of civilization, although  hopeless,&#xD;
was a   imtn6rable one. Like the brave warriors of the&#xD;
Natchez, when contending with the steel elad flowers of&#xD;
De Soto, and' aftewards with the French, they were only,&#xD;
conquered when no more were left to fight.&#xD;
But our fathers were at length, after years offanxious&#xD;
watchfuiess and strife, victorious; and the Indian tribes,.&#xD;
almostnnihilated, sullenly retreating, left their "hunting&#xD;
&#xD;
ground," the reward of victory, in the quiet possession of&#xD;
the conquerors.&#xD;
We are now the happy owners of this rich inheritance;&#xD;
and when we remember the dangers and privations under-&#xD;
gone by our immediate ancestors :in securing it, how&#xD;
sacred, in our estimation, should be the heritage:-&#xD;
"The dust&#xD;
Of heroes in the cause of glory fallen,&#xD;
Hath mingled with the soil and hallowed it."&#xD;
But, at the period of our story, this rich gift had not&#xD;
been wrested entirely from the hand of the stubborn&#xD;
savage. Barbarism had not .yet retreated before civiliza-&#xD;
tion; the tomahawk had not yet been lowered to the Long-&#xD;
knife, and society in Kentucky was only in a semi-civilized&#xD;
condition. Thenorthern portion of the State, dotted with&#xD;
forts and stations, and clustering neighborhoods,' had,&#xD;
for a year or more, been free from any marauding expe-&#xD;
dition of the savage. But, loth to give up their favorite&#xD;
hunting-ground, they were still troublesome in, the more&#xD;
sparsely settled districts of the south, and  along the 'v&amp;amp;al-&#xD;
leys of Green River; and the hardy settlers of this regime,&#xD;
although not confined to stations or block-houses, were&#xD;
still anxiously vigilant, keeping regular spies, old Indian&#xD;
fighters, patrolling the country in every direction, to give&#xD;
immediate alarm upon, any threatening appearance.&#xD;
It is to this section'of Kentucky we would now lead.a&#xD;
you, and at a very early period ; only three years after&#xD;
the scenes rebated in our last chapter.&#xD;
The immdiate locale was a. pioneer settlement in the&#xD;
then extensive country of N-, in the neighborhood&#xD;
(as it was atthat time called, though indeed some twenty&#xD;
miles distant) of the stations of "1. and  i . It was&#xD;
the fall of the year, some time in October, af1r the fiosts,&#xD;
with fairy skill and rapidity, had been painting the'heavy&#xD;
green garb of the forest to a more fanciful one of red and&#xD;
gold, when we approach a rough log cabin; in  eun-&#xD;
try, the ever, sure forerunner of farm-houses, to&#xD;
palacess.   e, all the houses of that day, it was&#xD;

with an open passage between, covered with clipboards,&#xD;
With rough dirt chimneys at each end, without windows&#xD;
to either room, and only lighted by doors; with heraand&#xD;
there a loophole, which answered the double purpose of&#xD;
affording aii and light; and a secure place of reconnoi-&#xD;
tringor opposing-an enemy. The doors were constructed&#xD;
ofheavy solid oak puncheons, by no means tasty orypau..&#xD;
tiful, made more for defence than ornament, and ehibit-&#xD;
ing very little of ;artistic skill.  The inclosure- imme-&#xD;
diately around the cabin was seemingly made with the&#xD;
same eye to. defence and security, for it was composed of&#xD;
stout stakes driven firmly into the ground and slightly&#xD;
sharpened- at the top, with, only One entrance, and that&#xD;
safely securediby a heavy gate made' of puncheons, very&#xD;
nimnilar to those used in the construction of the doors of&#xD;
the habitation. -This would have -beegya poordefence&#xD;
against the iron hail of civilized warfare;but slight and&#xD;
useless as it appeared to be, defended as it was by the&#xD;
strong arms, brave hearts, and deadly- rifles of Bryan&#xD;
Head, Duffe, Kenton, and -Titus, it was impregnable to&#xD;
the hurried onsets of the marauding savage;- and tfie hardy&#xD;
btrderer slept as quietly and securely in theirprimitive&#xD;
f.tortess, AS if girdled round' with stone walls, and protected&#xD;
byditch, bastion, and cannon.&#xD;
During the first year of their sojourn in the West,&#xD;
Bryanatnd his companions had halted in he older settle-&#xD;
4 ments,orth of the Kentucky River; but that portion of&#xD;
thecoirtry becoming too densely popul  = to suit the&#xD;

disposition,=and  ithal much given to Inan fighting,&#xD;

Altho h the region of country surrounding this sta-&#xD;

R i  'ry inroads of the savage, and was  pidly filling&#xD;

of the inhabitants, kept alive by-every now and then hear&#xD;
ing of the massacre of some family or distant station,&#xD;
made them still vigilant, and caused them to continue the&#xD;
employment of skilful hunters and spies to traverse the&#xD;
district, and give alarm upon the first appearance  f a&#xD;
moccason within the borders. Kenton, as a   ltri&#xD;
and daring scout, was one of the most trusted an vah&#xD;
of these adventurous characters, and, armed with hiso&#xD;
rifle, and followed- by the- trusty Bang,. he spent the&#xD;
greater portion of his time in -the woods, frequently&#xD;
making journeys of many days, and even weeks, scouting&#xD;
the borders, sometimes. going far beyond the extreme&#xD;
skirts of the white settlements. When his service was&#xD;
not required at the station, Kenton had more than once&#xD;
taken Titus as a companion in his solitary rambles; and&#xD;
the black, under the tuition of so expert a backwoods-&#xD;
man, had become quite a famous and skilful hunter, and&#xD;
withal,-as Simon used.laughingly to- say, "a great brave,"&#xD;
fog ke had taken. a scalp, and wore it triumphantly iast&#xD;
ened to his pouch, after the manner of his tutor.&#xD;
As to .Bryan and the Sergeant, when not engaged in&#xD;
resisting the occasional attacks of their savage foe, or in&#xD;
making;retaliatory excursions into the Indian territory,&#xD;
they were generally occupied in adding improvements to&#xD;
their settlement, in tilling the ground, in hunting-to lay&#xD;
up a winter's supply of meats, or-in exploring the country,&#xD;
and visiting the neighboring stations; and with these vai&#xD;
rious employments, were kept pretty busy, at least during&#xD;
the spring simmerr months.&#xD;
Kenton    dthe black had just returned from one of&#xD;
their expeditins into the Indian country. Wearied with&#xD;

the use of the Sergeant and his wife, and had been giving&#xD;
an account of his last expedition, good-humoredly paint-&#xD;
ing the terror of Titus, when they had stolen a couple-of&#xD;
fine horses from an Indian encampment, lest they should&#xD;
be overtaken andscalped..&#xD;
Bryan iras a shade stouter and more athletic than when&#xD;
we last saw him, and his complexion, from the exposure&#xD;
of a frontier life, a degree darker, but, in the estimation&#xD;
of his fair wife, he was none the worse-looking for that;&#xD;
and, indeed, with his smiling, open, and bronzed features,&#xD;
he looked all the more noble ; and for manly beauty, his&#xD;
superior it would be difficult to find, either in city or ham-&#xD;
let.- He no longer -wore the dress common in the older&#xD;
States, but his garb now was very similar to that'worn by&#xD;
Kenton, when first introduced to the reader, only his&#xD;
leather hunting-shirt and moccasons bore evident marks&#xD;
of the 'refined taste and superior care and attention of&#xD;
his wife, and were well calculated (for no Indian maign&#xD;
ever ornamented more beautifully, with quill and bead,&#xD;
than Coma) to set off and adorn his lithe and graceful&#xD;
person.&#xD;
Coma, too, had lost none of her ancient bloom or.love-&#xD;
liness by her sudden removal from the refined lu uries&#xD;
of fortune and exalted station to the scanty comforts ,of a&#xD;
perilous and half savage life. She had suffered many pri-&#xD;
irations, and the toil and fatigue of a frontier life had&#xD;
often been very trying to her delicate frame; but she met&#xD;
tjgi with a smile, and never grumbled; foishe knew it.&#xD;
ai been the labor not only of her devotedd husband, but&#xD;
of Duffe and his wife, and even of fenton; to make her&#xD;
as happy and contented as possible, and to save her, as far&#xD;
as in their power, from allhe ftigues necessarily attend-&#xD;
ant upan a home intheWilderness. Nor had they, as we&#xD;
have already intimated,been disappointed in their kindly&#xD;
endeavors, for Coma's smile  was ever the same sunny,&#xD;
content&amp;amp; one, and she had lost none of her brightness or&#xD;
buoyaiy since she left the proud mansionmof the- De&#xD;
Lacy   and no murmur of regrets for past comforts had&#xD;
eve j assed her lips,to chill the hearts of hex' loving and,&#xD;

&#xD;
delighted friends. The wild roses. of the forest might&#xD;
haveborrowed fresh - bloom  from her cheeks; and the&#xD;
brilliant eye of. the fawn was not more -sparkling than&#xD;
hers, as she toyed now with the curls of her sleeping boy,&#xD;
and smiled a proud mother's smile at his broad forehead&#xD;
and dimpled chin, The proudest dame of all j:land&#xD;
might have envied her her beauty and happiness, as s&#xD;
sat there, in her lowly cabin in the backwoods, made gla&#xD;
by the love of her husband and child.&#xD;
The Sergeant was unchanged, save in his apparel, for&#xD;
his old regimentals had long since bid him an eternal&#xD;
adieu; and, like Kenton and , Bryan, he had.-donned the&#xD;
borderer's light and graceful habit. And although ithad&#xD;
not added much grace or ease to the soldier's prim per-&#xD;
son, still, he had become so much attached to his fron-&#xD;
tier dress, that we doubt whether he would have ex-&#xD;
changed it even for a fresh, new uniform of the old con-&#xD;
tinentals. As to Duffe's wife, she was the same silent&#xD;
but cheerful, contented, simple-hearted, and industrious&#xD;
dame of other days ; and a most valuable auxiliary had sh~e&#xD;
been to the new settlement; for to her exertions did they&#xD;
owe the most of their household -comforts, and the very&#xD;
dresses worn by herself and Coma were the result ,of her&#xD;
labor and skill. She was never idle (remember, ladies),&#xD;
and even now, when we are describing her, was bowing&#xD;
with hand Vand foot, Itwirling her buzzing reel.&#xD;
.And what shall we say of old Titus? Not that he is&#xD;
honest, and-faithful, and brave, for he was ever that. Not&#xD;
that he has b ,come a whit darker, for he was always as.&#xD;
black as the arch-fiend himself. Not that he has got&#xD;
more comely, for now, as-"ever, he is as' ugly as Calian;&#xD;
nor has he in any way lost his appetite; for even::now"&#xD;
although but a moment ago having finished his supper,&#xD;
he is gazing with watery mouth a0, me fat bacon hang-&#xD;
ing over his head, at one side, or raer 'ithin theapa&#xD;

&#xD;
and sound enough, to make hypochondriacs of all the&#xD;
tooth doctors of this very tooth-doctoring age.&#xD;
To the Scout's bantering description of his terror, lest&#xD;
the Indians should overtake them with the stolen horses,&#xD;
Titus would have made a stout 'denial, had he not been&#xD;
for , 'd by Bryan remarking:--&#xD;
' ia   not so well satisfied, Simon, of the propriety or&#xD;
policy-to say nothing about the honesty-of these horse-&#xD;
stealing excursions into the territory of the savage. They&#xD;
have made no attack- upon us for some time back, and&#xD;
these losses may incite them to make reprisals."&#xD;
" As to the honesty of the "thing, Mr. Bryan,".replied&#xD;
Kenton, with a shrug of the shoulders,. "'we'll jist say&#xD;
nothin' 'bout it ; for it's been settled long ago, that the In-&#xD;
gens are our nateral-born inemies,- and are nateral-born&#xD;
thieves, to a sartainty. If they hain't--and we don't&#xD;
know t'hat-been out on any of thar scalping 'scursions&#xD;

they've got honest, but jist because it wer a losin' bisness&#xD;
to them, and' they are afeared of thar darned-.topknots.&#xD;
They won't do to count on, Mr. Bryan ; and if they hadn't&#xD;
stole any horses from us, they've made it up in stealin',&#xD;
from our neighbors on the border, and the critters we&#xD;
take from them they stole from the whites. I guess -it&#xD;
ar' all fair game, all round, and calculate the. red deils'&#xD;
don't think half as much 'bout the honesty of theithing&#xD;

"Bat the policy,'' said Bryan.&#xD;
"TIreckon thar's somethin' in that ar' obje&amp;amp;don of yourn,&#xD;

OR, VOW FULFILLED.              13&#xD;
,grinning Titus, as if he thought the negative came from&#xD;
him, and there lay the bone of contention.&#xD;
"-Don't talk of bringing back those dreadful Indians,&#xD;
Simon," exclaimed Coma, looking anxiously at her sleep-&#xD;
ing child.. "We have had quite enough of them, and&#xD;
have been long enough by ourselves to rejoice at the ap-&#xD;
proach of neighbors."&#xD;
- "Don't be afeared, Miss Coma," said the Scout, looking&#xD;
with kindly interest at her and her child, " for the Ingens&#xD;
were never more quiet ; and you know Sharp-Eye&#xD;
wouldn't let a moccason trail pass in twenty miles of the&#xD;
settlement without giving the alarm."&#xD;
."Thank you for the assurance," replied Coma, glancing&#xD;
with tearful interest at her sleeping infant ; "for since I&#xD;
have had this darling-one to love and watch over, I'm not&#xD;
as brave as I used to be, and tremble, sometimes, lest he&#xD;
should fall into the hands of the cruel savage."&#xD;
."Fall into the hands of the devil !" exclaimed Simon&#xD;
with some heat, at the very thought; "how' can he, with~&#xD;
Mister Bryan, the Sargeant, and Titus and me--to say&#xD;
nothing of Bang and -Sally-to guard him, and look after&#xD;
the redskins? Never fear, Miss Coma; it ar' an impossi-&#xD;
bility; and. drat me, if I won't be willin' to straddle a&#xD;
greased streak of lightnin', and be knocked into week&#xD;
after next, if I let a moccason trail come in twenty miles&#xD;

The father looked well pleased at this positive assur-&#xD;
ance of the bold borderer. Titus grinned his delight at&#xD;
the electrica~ teed imvoked by, the Scout, and the Ser-&#xD;
geant, with a laugh, remarked that "Simon had better&#xD;
keep a sharp lookout, if he didn't want to have a raster&#xD;
ride than he ever made upon the back of a stolen horseY"&#xD;
But Coma, smiling contentedly, and well satisfied, for she&#xD;

candle made from the comb of the wild bee, led the way&#xD;
across the open passage dividing the two apartments, and&#xD;
was quickly followed by Coma, bearing in her arms her&#xD;
sleeping child,.the giant form of the Scout bringing up&#xD;
the rear. The next moment they stood within Coma's&#xD;
winter lodge.&#xD;
Moving hastily forward to a square little box, filled&#xD;
with soft and pliant skins, and which she had dignified&#xD;
with the title of cradle, Coma placed her child gently in&#xD;
it, at the same time throwing over him a rich and warm&#xD;
covering of dark, furs, but so as to leave his head and,&#xD;
face fully- exposed, and in beautiful, relief against the&#xD;
sable garniture of his primitive bed.&#xD;
"Is he not beautiful!". she exclaimed, stopping a mo-&#xD;
ment to gaze with a mother's pride at her lovely boy-&#xD;
"d see what a nice bed he's got 1 it is soft and rich&#xD;
enough for a prince!'&#xD;
Beautiful!" murmured Bryan.&#xD;
"Glorious!" exclaimed Kenton, with sparkling eye.&#xD;
"But the bed?" said Coma.&#xD;
"'Taint to be beat I" replied Simon; emphatically, "by&#xD;
any of the 'hogany contraptions of the old States. The&#xD;
grand ladies might turn up their noses, Miss Coma, at&#xD;
young Mister ,Bryan's crib; but I guess, though they do&#xD;
pay a power of money for their baby toggery, this here&#xD;
consarn, if them ar' furs were taken over the Ridge, would&#xD;
buy a dozen of thar 'hogany fixens I"&#xD;
"And look at the room, Simon, how nice and warm it&#xD;
is,"-said Coma, as she stirred up the fire; and with smil-&#xD;
ing face, pointed to the floor and walls.&#xD;
"Just as nice as if I had done.it myself," replied the&#xD;
Scout approvingly; "and I wish that tarnal rascally&#xD;
cousin of, yourn wer' here, to see how well we can do up&#xD;
things in the backbds."&#xD;
9A. slight s hovered a moment over the face of&#xD;
Coma, at tb&amp;amp;ihtntion of Captain Jean; but not wishing&#xD;
to distl b- the very evident satisfaction of Simon, by&#xD;
showing any: sign of uneasiness, she mastered her emo-&#xD;
tion,gsaying, with laughing glee--&#xD;
.sow isn't that an elegant carpet and rich hearth-rug&#xD;
&#xD;
and look at the walls, how beautifully they are papered;&#xD;
and just sit, down a moment in that .big arm-chair, and&#xD;
see how warm and comfortable it is; and if you want to&#xD;
see something very rich and warm, take a look atthat&#xD;
counterpane on the bed."&#xD;
"Elegant," said Kenton, throwing himself into the&#xD;
chair, and glancing quickly around at each article of&#xD;
furniture, named by Coma, "and fit for a queen! Cuss&#xD;
me if they ain't splendiferous, and no mistake."&#xD;
And:that little room, only some, eighteen feet square,&#xD;
ornamented and furnished as it was, presented a rare&#xD;
combination of savage luxury and civilized taste, and&#xD;
was well worthy of the unqualified admiration of the&#xD;
Scout.&#xD;
The apartment itself, and the furniture .of the apart-&#xD;
ment, was of the roughest and most primitive mould, but&#xD;
we doubt much whether the most splendidly furnished&#xD;
parlors of the most refined and luxurious of the present&#xD;
day, could boast of more comfort, or indeed of more&#xD;
wealth. The loose puncheon floor was entirely concealed&#xD;
and covered with a carpet of buffalo robes, soft, yielding,&#xD;
and springy, even more so than the most costly and ex-&#xD;
pensive Brussels; and two choice, long-haired black bear&#xD;
skins made a striking and unique, but at the same time&#xD;
very handsome. and sleep-inviting hearth-rug.  The&#xD;
walls of the room were covered, or papered, as Coma&#xD;
laughingly called it, with the dressed skins of the deer&#xD;
and elk, with the hair exposed, and the hides all neatly&#xD;
and evenly pinned down, -so as to conceal the unbarked&#xD;
logs and mud chinking of -the cabin. The bed, to which&#xD;
Coma had pointed with so much pride, would have been&#xD;
a chef-d'ouvre, or rich ornament, to the most princely&#xD;
chamber; for though it was sheeted and pillowed as is&#xD;
" usual with beds, and had a few blankets thrown over it,&#xD;
it was also curtailed around with they"f. liant, spotted&#xD;
skin of the fawn, and had thrown over :etand blanket&#xD;
a .counterpane more costly than the, richest silk, for it&#xD;
was made entirely and completely of the very rarest furs,&#xD;
richly and beautifully diversified with the purest white,&#xD;
and most glossy black. The arm-chair in which inoi&#xD;

was setting, was a huge.concern, almost large enough for&#xD;
a bed, and if stripped of its covering, would have been a&#xD;
very ungainly piece of furniture,.for it was made entirely&#xD;
with the knife and-tomahawk; but.all these imperfections&#xD;
were hid by soft cushions of bear and buffalo hides, and-&#xD;
the whole concealed and ornamented by aflowing canopy&#xD;
of panther skins. The stools and chairs of the apartment&#xD;
were likewise fancifully covered with various kinds of&#xD;
furs and skins; and two immense antlers of the elk, stand-&#xD;
ing out over the fireplace (for there was no mantle), held&#xD;
the trusty rifle of Bryan, and completed the decoration of&#xD;
their backwoods boudoir. It was a strange and motley&#xD;
ornamented room, that "winter lodge" of Coma's; pre-&#xD;
senting a grotesque combination of savage wealth and&#xD;
wildness, refined and made comfortable and tasteful by&#xD;
the plastic touch of education; and, as the graceful and&#xD;
delicate figure of the young wife glided from point to&#xD;
point, marking out its rare beauties, reminded one of the&#xD;
fabled stories of the Indies, and of the fairies and genii,&#xD;
and the palaces constructed by them, so wonderful to the&#xD;
youthful imagination.&#xD;
This singular adornment of Coma's room was the re-&#xD;
suit of a hint given by Kenton, by whom most of the&#xD;
skins and furs had been presented ; but the execution&#xD;
was far. beyond his expectation or conception, for his&#xD;
views only extended to comfort ; and now, when he&#xD;
looked around upon everything so comfortable, and at'&#xD;
the same time so tasteful and beautiful, he could not re-&#xD;
strain the loud expression of his delight and satisfaction.&#xD;
"Yes, it is beautiful !" said ~Ooma, delighted with the&#xD;
pleasure of the honest Scout, "and no one would expect&#xD;
to see such a rich and cozy chamber in a rough log cabin,&#xD;
out in the backwoods. I wouldn't be ashamed of my&#xD;
lodge in the old States"&#xD;
"Darn me! ifi  in't jest a little superior to anything&#xD;
I ever saw I" replied Simon, with truthful simplicity and&#xD;
warmth; "and I reckon, Mister Bryan, them ar' palaces,&#xD;
the Britishers used to tell us 'bout, wern't nigh equal to&#xD;
this!"&#xD;
"Not for comfCort-or love-or happiness," replied&#xD;
&#xD;
Bryan, glancing with beaming eye at the beautiful coun-&#xD;
tenance of his devoted wife; "nor will we ever want a&#xD;
prouder or nobler home than this, or dearer and more&#xD;
loving friends, than we now have around us !"&#xD;
"Only keep away those horrible Indians, Simon," said&#xD;
Coma with a laugh,. which had a faint note of terror&#xD;
mingled with- it, "and I will be inexpressibly happy."&#xD;
"Never fear the red devils, Miss Coma," replied Ken-&#xD;
ton; "I guess they're 'bout to 'give up thar hunting-&#xD;
grounds, and will trouble us no more. But I won't trust&#xD;
them for a spell yet, and will keep up my scouten, though&#xD;
I don't much 'pect ever to come 'cross an Indian trail in'&#xD;
these parts agin. Good-night," he added, rising to his&#xD;
feet, "I'll go and fasten the gate, give Bang his. orders,&#xD;
and then to sleep."&#xD;
"Good-night!'" replied Bryan, "but I see. no use of&#xD;
troubling yourself about the gate, Simon, for there is no&#xD;
danger."&#xD;
"Thar's no tellin'," m ttered the cautious spy, "and we&#xD;
had better keep things secure, at any rate. Thar never&#xD;
wer' a scalp lost yet by too much care."&#xD;
"You are right, Simon," murmured Coma," but, good.&#xD;
night-and don't forget to-keep a strict lookout for In-&#xD;
dians."&#xD;
Kenton, after returning her look of mingled merriment&#xD;
and seriousness with a kind smile of assurance, turned&#xD;
upon his heel, end was gone:&#xD;
And now, the young father and mother left alone,&#xD;
stood lovingly beside the cradle of their sleeping infant-&#xD;
their hearts filled with happiness and content, and dream-&#xD;

CHAPTER       II.&#xD;
AN old man lay on his death-bed. The furniture of&#xD;
the sick room,. and the soft couch, upon which the dying&#xD;
man was confined, betokened not only wealth, but even&#xD;
luxury. But little did that old man now care for the&#xD;
-riches with which he was surrounded; for his hand was&#xD;
feeble, scarce able to push back the soft coverlet that op-&#xD;
pressed, with even its light weight, his panting chest-&#xD;
and his eye was dim, very dim, and clouds were= gather-&#xD;
ing fast over it. He could neither enjoy nor behold the&#xD;
-luxuries around him; all to him was now vanity, and&#xD;
worse than vanity. But although there was a cloud fast&#xD;
gathering over the old man's eyes,-and his sight was mo-&#xD;
mentarily becoming dimmer and dimmer, there was also&#xD;
a cloud upon his heart ; and onie darker and even more&#xD;
oppressive than that upon his vision. It was not a cloud&#xD;
of sorrow, caused by pain or sickness, or approaching&#xD;
death, for he was old and feeble, and could scarce hope&#xD;
for longer life; but it was the darkest of all clouds, even&#xD;
darker than the valley and shadow of death-a cloud of&#xD;
remorse upon the soul! He was dying now,-and dying&#xD;
without having had an opportunity to forgive, or be for-&#xD;
given,. by his only child. The last sun of his existence&#xD;
had arisen, and was fast sinking in the west, and there&#xD;
was no kind hand present to smooth his dying pillow, or&#xD;
loving heart to drop a tear over his departure. -&#xD;
It was an awful death to die; and no wonder there&#xD;
was a cloud upon that old man's heart, and weary heavi-&#xD;
ness about his soul.,&#xD;
'Tis a dreadful tate to have no one to love, or to be&#xD;
loved by ! and we could wish no greater curse to our&#xD;
most hated enemy, if we had one, than that he might&#xD;
outlive his friends.&#xD;
Theworld may seek after glory, and long to be feared,&#xD;
&#xD;
wondered at, or admired, but give us your love, and we&#xD;
are satisfied. For ourselves, we would rather have the&#xD;
love of wife, children,-and friends, than to be the emperor&#xD;
of allthe Russias, and have millions to tremble with&#xD;
terror at our nod; and we would rather be remembered,&#xD;
when in our grave, with kindly affection by our acquaint-&#xD;
ances, than to fill a page in history, and be pointed out&#xD;
by the applauding multitude as a great conqueror or&#xD;
statesman.&#xD;
Yet that old man, friendless and deserted in his death&#xD;
agony (if we take the common impression of the world)&#xD;
had been a greatly blessed and .happy man-for he had&#xD;
wealth, and had been honored; and must have been-so&#xD;
think poor foolish men (but, -oh! how falsely)-happy.&#xD;
He had been one of the honored of earth; butwhat to&#xD;
him -were his honors now-and what his wealth? and&#xD;
where the great troop of friends made during a long and&#xD;
prosperous life'? The first were rapidly sliding from his&#xD;
nerveless grasp, and, of the latter, he had none. His&#xD;
pride of wealth and family had chilled and driven from&#xD;
him every heart, and there was no one left to love that&#xD;
old man now. The only one that he might have looked&#xD;
to with certainty, for sympathy and affection, he had&#xD;
driven forth with curses; and she was now far away, and&#xD;
knew not that the cold damp of the nearing tomb had'&#xD;
softened his heart, and destroyed (as it always does) the&#xD;
stubborn pride of his'soul.&#xD;
. Death. is a great leveller; and the grinning skeleton;&#xD;
with his bloody scythe, soon drives from the heart of poor&#xD;
mortal man his longings after honors, and his desire for&#xD;
or gratification in. wealth. 'Tis a chilling thought to&#xD;
know that, of all the goods and luxuries he has gathered&#xD;
together, by a life of danger and toil, he can take nothing&#xD;
with him; and though he be the most honored of earth,&#xD;
if he has not done his duty to God and man, that he can-&#xD;
not be even the least in heaven. But it i, doubly chilling&#xD;
to the man who has made money his godkand considered&#xD;
wealth the acme of happiness, to die, and without a loving&#xD;
heart near him, and without one loved child or friend&#xD;
to whom he may leave his vast possessions.&#xD;

20            THE WINTER LODGE;&#xD;
&#xD;
Some such thoughts as these had embittered, the last&#xD;
illness of De Lacy-for he was the dying man-and were&#xD;
busy now gnawing at his heart; but. remorse came too&#xD;
late.&#xD;
"Wild with despair&#xD;
He poured his prayer,&#xD;
Whirled in the giddy tempest round;&#xD;
His blasted pride&#xD;
The gods deride,&#xD;
And all his daring hopes confound."&#xD;
But he would not -die without one more struggle to&#xD;
make at least :a partial atonement for- past cruelty and&#xD;
neglect ; and the love for his only child, long. smothered&#xD;
by fierce pride, came welling tip from the secret little&#xD;
fountain of his heart, now that he- was about to pass&#xD;
away; and the old man, struggling in the grasp of death,&#xD;
faintly whispered: "Jean! Jean!"&#xD;
"What' would you have ?" said Montlack, rising from&#xD;
his comfortable seat by the fire, and approaching the&#xD;
couch of the dying man.&#xD;
"A pen and paper," gasped De Lacy.&#xD;
"Wihat would you with pen and paper now ?" said&#xD;
Montlack, quickly, with a suspicious glance at the agi-&#xD;
tated countenance of the old man. .-&#xD;
"A  pen and paper quickly, Jean, or I ring for a&#xD;
servantI" exclaimed De Lacy,- struggling to, a sitting&#xD;
posture, and laying his long, attenuated fingers upon the&#xD;
handle of a small bell.&#xD;
"You are too feeble to~ exert yourself, uncle," said&#xD;
Montlack, with well-assumed care for his dying relative,&#xD;
"and must not fatigue yourself by over-eertion."&#xD;
"Will you go ?" said the old maI,  sternly.&#xD;
"Ay, if it be your will," replied Montlack, moving&#xD;
slowly (for he wished time for thought) to bring the re.&#xD;
quired articles.&#xD;
"Too ]ate, too late!" murmured De Lacy; and, as if&#xD;
struck with the°tiecessity of haste, he called out in an&#xD;
eager and trembling voice: "Where have you gone,&#xD;
Jean ? mal haste, or I shall die, and.without -giving her&#xD;
my fiiyness."&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, VOW FULFILLED.             21&#xD;
"HaP' exclaimed Montlack to himself, as he caught&#xD;
the sound of the old man's eage-r voice, "I would that I&#xD;
knew his design? If I were only certain that my fears&#xD;
were not groundless, he might die, but he should never&#xD;
have pen and paper again."~&#xD;
" Jean I Jean I" groaned the old man, "will you never&#xD;
come?"&#xD;
-"I am here, uncle 1" said Montlack, with affected sor-&#xD;
row, at the same time placing the articles demanded by&#xD;
De Lacy, upon a. table, by the side of his couch; "and&#xD;
now, what would you do ?"&#xD;
"This! this !" exclaimed De Lacy, with trembling eager-&#xD;
ness, as, rallying his exhausted powers, he began hurriedly&#xD;
to write.&#xD;
or a few moments the old man wrote on, in silence;&#xD;
Montlack the while, standing with lowering brow, watch-&#xD;
ing the rapid movements of his pen, but not daring to&#xD;
interrupt him.&#xD;
" Some brandy, Jean! I grow weak !", gasped IDe Lacy.&#xD;
Montlack, in silence, handed him a goblet, and after&#xD;
swallowing a mouthful of the sparkling liquid-as if re-&#xD;
vived and strengthened by the drink, the dying man once&#xD;
more seized his pen, and continued to write.&#xD;
"Would that you had become weak enough to die, be-&#xD;
fore this mad freak entered your crazy brain !" thought&#xD;
the selfish and trembling Jean; but he made no remark,&#xD;
and only followed with his eyes the rapid movement':of&#xD;
his dying relative's pen.&#xD;
"Thank God! 'tis finished! 'tis finished!" murmured&#xD;
De Lacy, the pen dropping from his fingers, as he sank&#xD;
back exhausted'upon his pillow.&#xD;
"What is finished?" -said Montlack eagerly, in his&#xD;
anxiety drawing a step hearer to the table, and dying&#xD;
man.&#xD;
''My will, Jean."&#xD;
"HaI!" ejaculated Montlack, starting back with surprise,&#xD;
while a heavy frown gathered upon his brow. "You&#xD;
would change your will, wottld you ?"&#xD;
"I have done it ! there it is, Jean, on the table I" said&#xD;

&#xD;
De Lacy, ,with a faint effort, at a smile, "but I have not&#xD;
forgotten you, as you will see!"&#xD;
"But why change it at all?" asked Montlack.&#xD;
"You used to tell me, Jean, when the pdor girl first&#xD;
went away, to forgive .her, but my heart was hard and&#xD;
cold then, and I would not ; 'tis soft now, and I would&#xD;
fain let dear Coma know my forgiveness."&#xD;
Montlack muttered a curse-for the hypocrite, in. at-&#xD;
tempting to prove to his uncle that he had no selfish mo-&#xD;
tive, had overreached himself; but now, that he might&#xD;
know the worst, he stretched out his hand as if to take&#xD;
up the new will, saying-&#xD;
"Shall I read it ?"&#xD;
"Not now, Jean! I have. not many moments to live,.&#xD;
and would devote them to other matters! You will'see&#xD;
it soon enough, for I have made you my executor."&#xD;
"A great honor, for which you will receive my thanks,"&#xD;
said Montlack, with an ill concealed eneer, and in a tone&#xD;
which would have been'remarked by the dying man, had&#xD;
he been blessed, with his usual clearness of intellect.&#xD;
" Who else-could, or would be more faithful than you,&#xD;
Jean ?" replied De Lacy, confidently ; for he scarce noticed&#xD;
what his nephew said-and had no thought of his man-&#xD;
ner.&#xD;
"Ay, who else!l" said Montlack, with a meaning smile.&#xD;
"You are my nearest relative, Jean, except poor Coma,&#xD;
and I knew you would feel more interest in her fate&#xD;
than a stranger, and would gladly' bear her the pardon&#xD;
and blessing of a dying father."&#xD;
"I have only been waiting your death to hunt her&#xD;
up," thought Montlack, "but not to- be the messenger of&#xD;
gladness to her, or of wealth to her hated husband."&#xD;
"I fear we have been too harsh with the poor child,"&#xD;
continued the old man, without noticing the silence of his&#xD;
nephew ; "and may-be, after all, her husband was innocent&#xD;
-=and like his father (I have discovered we were wrong&#xD;
there, Jean), was the victim of some designing enemy."&#xD;
"You areby no means flattering to him you have&#xD;
chosen as your executor !" said Mont ack firmly, and with&#xD;
the look and tone of an injured man,1 "and did I consider&#xD;
&#xD;
you i1 your proper mind, I would not remain to be thus&#xD;
insulted. If you will but remember, I was the prosecu-&#xD;
tor of this son-in-law of yours, at this late hour acknow-&#xD;
ledged, and, if he be innocent, then-I am guilty !"&#xD;
De Lacy looked sharply, and even suspiciously into the&#xD;
face of his companion; but his eye, dim with age and&#xD;
approaching death, could trace nothing but honest indigna-&#xD;
tion in the countenance of Captain Jean.&#xD;
'"My proper mind'?" he at length muttered, as if com-&#xD;
muning with his own heart. "My God! I have never&#xD;
been in my proper mind until now! -Pride has been my&#xD;
curse through life, and has ever hung like a dark curtain&#xD;
before my vision, shutting out all, but self! Pride! pride t&#xD;
ay, it has been the ruin of my happiness, for it drove&#xD;
from me the only one to whom I could look for love."&#xD;
"Your late repentance," said Montlack, "has made you&#xD;
strangely forgetful, and ungenerous-and, I might add,&#xD;
unjust. I have never deserted you; and of all the friends&#xD;
of your wealth and power, I alone remain to soothe your&#xD;
last moments ; and yet, you seem to look upon me with&#xD;
suspicion-and have not hesitated .to insult me, by insinu-&#xD;
ating ingratitude and, want of affection ; have I deserved&#xD;
this of you?"&#xD;
"Pardon me, Jean, if I have said or done anything to&#xD;
wound your feelings," replied the old man, pressing with&#xD;
feeble hand his pale forehead, "for my mind wanders so,&#xD;
I scarce know  hat I do, or say! !You are a De Lacy,&#xD;
and have stood nobly by the last of the name, and may&#xD;
God reward you, boy!"&#xD;
" I had expected to be rewarded by another !" thought&#xD;
Montlack, but he did not give utterance to his selfish&#xD;
thoughts, only muttering in his disappointment, and scarce&#xD;
knowing what he said.&#xD;
"But your will?"&#xD;
" My will! what of it, Jean, what of it! is it not there ?&#xD;
and will you not execute my wishes ?" gasped the dying&#xD;
man eagerly.&#xD;
"Ay! I will execute the will.of your proper and sane&#xD;
mind, but not this last, unless it be vastly different from&#xD;
what I expect," thought Montlack. But wishingto know&#xD;

the worst, and whether the former will, which he knew&#xD;
his uncle had made in a moment of anger, just after the&#xD;
marriage of his daughter, and which left him as the sole&#xD;
heir to the De Lacy estate, was still in existence, he only&#xD;
said, "but your former will, what of it ?"&#xD;
"God.bless you Jean, for reminding me of it. I had&#xD;
forgotten it; bring it here, quick ! quick !" exclaimed the&#xD;
old man, struggling up in his bed and pointing to an&#xD;
escritoire, i"it is there! there! -and I would not have&#xD;
my curses on the poor child remain when I am dead.&#xD;
Bless you! bless you, boy! it would have broken poor&#xD;
Coma's heaxtgto have eid those bitter anathemas of her&#xD;
father."&#xD;
"Rather curse me," muttered Montlack to himself, "for&#xD;
being such a' miserable idiot ! But he shall not destroy'&#xD;
it,"thought the baffled hypocrite, moving off slowly to&#xD;
obey the request of his dying relative; "for if he should&#xD;
cancel this first testament making me his heir, then Coma&#xD;
would be the representative, let what will become of this&#xD;
last!"&#xD;
"Have you found it, Jean ?" asked De Lacy, impa-&#xD;
tiently.&#xD;
"Not yet," said Montlack, carelessly tossing about the&#xD;
loose- papers found in the escritoire ; "but it is of little&#xD;
consequence, uncle, whether I find it or -iot, or whether&#xD;
I find it now or not!."&#xD;
The old man made an impatient gesture, but said no-'&#xD;
ting.&#xD;
"Let it go," continued Montlack, "this last will cancels&#xD;
the first, and I, as your executor, will have it destroyedI"&#xD;
"No, no! it must be burned nom; and in my sight !"&#xD;
said De Lacy, quickly; "I cannot die in peace with those&#xD;
bitter,;curses of mine still in existence. 'Tis there, Jean,&#xD;
in the drawerto the right, you cannot mistake it!"&#xD;
" Ay, here it is!" said Montlack, having no longer an&#xD;
excuse for delay'&#xD;
"Burn it, burn it'" eagerly gasped the dying man ; "let&#xD;
me see it ima blaze, and look at it crumble to ashes, and&#xD;
I will die satisfied ; my child shall be my heir 1"&#xD;
" Ha !'R hought Montlack, "'tis as I expected, but all&#xD;
is not yet lost; I have it in my possession, the paper&#xD;
&#xD;
securing me wealth and power, and I will not willingly&#xD;
destroy it."&#xD;
"Haste! haste, Jean ! to the fire with it, or it will be&#xD;
too late! Burn it ! burn it! let me see my curses wither&#xD;
into ashes, and I will die content, pouring blessings upon&#xD;
your head; but hesitate, and I curse you !"&#xD;
Montlack still stood by the escritoire with the .will in&#xD;
his hand, but made no motion towards the fire.&#xD;
"Not yet, Jean ?" said the old man, impatiently; add-&#xD;
ing, as a suspicion of his nephew's design flashed across&#xD;
his mind, " will you fulfil my wishes, or must I ring for&#xD;
the housekeeper, to have my commands executed ?"&#xD;
The threat of the housekeeper brought the Captain to&#xD;
his senses, for he wanted no witnesses to that last inter-&#xD;
view ; and,.grinding his teeth with rage, he muttered:-&#xD;
" It will be time enough to ring for a servant when I&#xD;
refuse !"&#xD;
"Then burn it, burn it at once, or I ring !" said De Lacy,&#xD;
laying his hand upon the bell.&#xD;
"I will, I will!" exclaimed Montlack, quickly and eag-&#xD;
erly; a sudden thought of villany coming to his rescue&#xD;
at this sore strait. "Here, see it burn, uncle !" he added,-&#xD;
stepping to the fire and kindling into a blaze a paper, at&#xD;
that distance very similar in appearance.to the will, which&#xD;
he had cunningly dropped back into the drawer.&#xD;
"I can't see it, Jean!" said the old iman sadly, and in a&#xD;
faint voice; "a' mist is gathering over my sight, and all&#xD;
to me is night!"&#xD;
"Now look; incle, and you'll see the blaze, and, if that&#xD;
will satisfy, may die satisfied !" exclaimed Mbntlack, boldly&#xD;
walking to' the side' of the bed, and holdingu in hi&#xD;
hand the half-consumed paper.&#xD;
With, a desperate efirE tie old man rallied his sinking&#xD;
powers, and drove back fo a moment the heavy mist from&#xD;
his fast fading vision; and as' he caught sight of the&#xD;
bright blaze of the burning paper in the hand of his&#xD;
treacherous nephew, with a smile of triumph sunk back&#xD;
upon his pillow. Rejoicing in the success of his dee&#xD;

" Thank God, there is no curse of mine resting upon my&#xD;
child now ! Bless you, Coma! bless you! bless you 1",&#xD;
The silver cord was loosed, the golden bowl was broken,&#xD;
and, after life's fitful dream, the old man slept in peace.&#xD;
He was dead.&#xD;
"Thank God !" muttered the dark hypocrite with a sigh&#xD;
of relief, as he beheld the marble seal of eternity settle&#xD;
down upon the shrunken brow and cheek of his deeeved&#xD;
relative; "the battle is over at last, and I have woni"?&#xD;
Her father was dead,his last thoughts had been of her,&#xD;
and his last words were a blessing; but she was far away,.&#xD;
and knew it not; and poor Coina, will she ever know that&#xD;
she has been forgiven ?&#xD;
"Never !" shouted Montlack, striking his hand heavily&#xD;
upon the table. He had no fear now of arousing the old&#xD;
man, for, without stopping even to close his eyes, the eager&#xD;
villain had grasped. hislast will, and had been rapidly&#xD;
poring over it.  "Never! never" he -again exclaimed,&#xD;
when he had fully learned its contents; ".never shall she&#xD;
know that he has forgiven her, or that she is the only&#xD;
heir and representative of De lacy !"&#xD;
As if satisfied with this positive declaration of his&#xD;
intentions toward his cousin, Montlack sat a moment in&#xD;
thoughtful silence, with his eyes fastened upon the floor,&#xD;
and a cunning, disagreeable smile playing around his&#xD;
mouth; then, folding up the last will of his uncle he con-&#xD;
cealed it in his bosom; and then; as if he had nothing&#xD;
else to do, for the first time raised his head and permitted&#xD;
his wandering vision to rest upon the pale countenance&#xD;
of the dead man.&#xD;
For a moment, the heartless villain shuddered and&#xD;
trembled in his seat, as he caught sight of the cold, stony&#xD;
eyes of the corpse, glaring, -as he imagined, full and&#xD;
threateningly upon hum; but it was only for a moment; for&#xD;
an instant thought told him those leaden eyes were now&#xD;
sightless, and that his treachery and villany, both to the&#xD;
dead and the living, were alike unknown and unseen by&#xD;
mortal eye.&#xD;
"Ha! ha!" he laughed, attempting to drive away his&#xD;
uneasy thoughts by forced merriment; "I thought the&#xD;
&#xD;
old fellow had come to life again, and, sacre ! felt : any-&#xD;
thing but easy. But he's safe enough now; and his&#xD;
fortune is safe enough. I have not lived a sycophant,&#xD;
and liar, and villain so long for nothing. The De Lacy&#xD;
estate is worthy of the struggle, and it will take more&#xD;
than the glare of a'pair of sightless eyes to turn me back,&#xD;
now that I have wealth and power within my grasp. The&#xD;
hour I have long hoped for has come at last ; and fool,&#xD;
worse than fool, was the old idiot, to think that I would&#xD;
now, not only strip myself of riches, but be the messen-&#xD;
ger of his forgiveness to this scornful cousin of mine, and&#xD;
her upstart husband. Ha! ha! this would be taking a&#xD;
Christian revenge with a vengeance; but it .don't suit me;&#xD;
and I'll have other, and to me, more agreeable satisfac-&#xD;
tion. They think I have forgotten them," added Mont-&#xD;
lack, a dark scowl of hatred disfiguring his face; "but&#xD;
they will yet awake with a howl of sorrow from their&#xD;
pleasant dream. Vengeance delayed is not vengeance&#xD;
satisfied, and let them beware; for my hour, the hour lng&#xD;
hoped and prayed for, has come, and with it my desire&#xD;
for revenge. Jean Montlack has neveryet forgotten an&#xD;
injury, or forgiven an enemy; nor has he often permitted&#xD;
a threat to go unfulfilled.&#xD;
"Your long-delayed blessing, old man, contained in&#xD;
this paper," he continued, striking his hand upon his&#xD;
bosom, "she shall never know or heir from me. But your&#xD;
curses, ha! ha! she shall know them all; they shall burn&#xD;
into her soul, and she shall yet feel the power of her&#xD;
scorned lover .Ha! ha! glare away with your sightless&#xD;
eyes; I fear them not. ~ Your hand is chilled now and&#xD;
stiff, and can never more wield a pen; and your tongue&#xD;
is silent enough; it' can neither curse nor bless now; and,&#xD;
what is still better for me, can tell nothing of my villany.&#xD;
Ha! ha! Monsieur Jean, you are a precious hypocrite and&#xD;
villain; but what matter now, you have won; no longer&#xD;
Montlack, but De Lacy; and, with a princely estate in pos-&#xD;
session, the world will not pry very closely into my char-&#xD;
acter. Wealth is power; and wealth will cover a multi.&#xD;
tude of sins."&#xD;

sarcasm, Montlack turned to the table, and taking up the&#xD;
bell, upon which the icy fingers of De Lacy still rested,&#xD;
summoned the housekeeper. On the approach of Mrs.&#xD;
Martin, who filled this important station in the household&#xD;
of De Lacy, Montlack, assuming a look and tone of the&#xD;
deepest sorrow, made known the death of his uncle; and&#xD;
then,'after giving some necessary orders to the weeping&#xD;
old woman, quickly left the chamber of death and retired&#xD;
to his own room.&#xD;
"Poor- fellow!" muttered the good dame, as the door&#xD;
closed behind him, "he takes it mighty hard, the death of&#xD;
his uncle. I wonder who's the.heir ?"&#xD;
The. query of the housekeeper was a very natural one;&#xD;
and a thought of the bright face of Coma flitted across&#xD;
her memory as she made it, but she was too wise a woman&#xD;
to give utterance to that forbidden name in the presence&#xD;
of the dead body of her master, more especially as she&#xD;
was .pretty well satisfied that Mister Jean filled that (in&#xD;
her estimation) most important of all stations.&#xD;
I&amp;amp;or was she mistaken ; for although, in truth and jus-&#xD;
tice, he was.still nothing more than plain Jean Montlack,&#xD;
and without fortune, yet by the only will of his uncle&#xD;
ever exhibited to the world, he became and assumed (and&#xD;
unquestioned by any one) the ancient name of De Lacy,'&#xD;
and along with it the vast-estate'of his deceased relative.&#xD;
Poor Coma! she knew not of her father's death, nor&#xD;
had she ever coveted his wealth. She was happy in her&#xD;
winter lodge upon the distant frontier; more happy, per-&#xD;
haps, than if she had been the mistress of the proud man-&#xD;
sion of her father. She was as rich as her heart desired,&#xD;
for she was loved by her husband- and child, and had&#xD;
them to love. Those gathered in the halls of her ancient&#xD;
home, to attend the stately funeral of the last of. the De&#xD;
Lacy's, may have thought of the bright face seen there in&#xD;
other days'; but for her, their tongues expressed no sym-&#xD;
pathy; and in her right, had she appeared to claim her&#xD;
own, no one would have raised a hand against the smiling,&#xD;
plausible, and now popular Captain Jean Montlack.&#xD;
Wealth ispower! and riches cover a multitude of sins;&#xD;
and, no one was more aware of this fact than the new&#xD;
owner of the Do Lacy estate.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER       III.&#xD;
ABoUT three weeks after the events narrated in our last&#xD;
chapter, a solitary horseman picked his way carefully&#xD;
along a first trail or path, winding among the rugged&#xD;
hills, lying off in a southeast direction from the station&#xD;
of Head and Duffe-distant some five-and-twenty miles,&#xD;
and 'somewhere near the present boundary line of the&#xD;
counties of Logan and Muhlenberg.&#xD;
It was a wild and desolate scene, a picturesque min-&#xD;
gling together of abrupt hills, deep valleys, and moss-&#xD;
covered limestone rocks; the whole made dark, and&#xD;
shadowy, and gloomy and cheerless enough, by a thick&#xD;
matted undergrowth of hazle-nut, pea, and grape-vine,&#xD;
overshadowed and sombre, from the huge wide-spreading&#xD;
boughs of the overtopping forest. The rider seemed to&#xD;
be in doubt as to his road;'for he travelled very slowly,&#xD;
frequently stopping on the points of the hills to make&#xD;
observations; and more than once, when the' path became&#xD;
very much confused, dismounting from his horse to make&#xD;
a closer examination of the trace he had been pursuing;&#xD;
every now and then, as the trail became more faint' and&#xD;
indistinct, and he himself seemed perplexed by the rug.&#xD;
gedness of the route, and its tortuous windings along&#xD;
the hills and hollows, having  recourse to a small&#xD;
pocket-compass, which always appeared to satisfy him&#xD;
and dispel his hesitation; for, after each examination,&#xD;
he pressed forward with renewed .zeal and energy--not,&#xD;
however, without casting many anxious glances around&#xD;
him, as if fearful of or expecting some lurking: enemy.&#xD;
He had not the appearance of a borderer or backwoods:.&#xD;
man, nor indeed of one accustomed to the hardships of a&#xD;
frontier life ; and was dressed with far more care and&#xD;
luxury,:and we might add taste, than was, usually met&#xD;
with at that early period in Kentucky. Although he&#xD;
knew the use of a compass, and seemed to derive some&#xD;

&#xD;
benefit from his knowledge, he could not be a surveyor,.&#xD;
intent upon locating wild lands, for his face and person&#xD;
were too slight and delicate, and, his carefully gloved&#xD;
handtoo small and white to be one of that hardy and&#xD;
adventurous class;-and then, if that had been his busi-&#xD;
ness, he certainly would have chosen more fertile and&#xD;
cultivable lands than those over which he was now pick-&#xD;
ing his toilsome way. The reader may suppose that the&#xD;
very manner in which he was travelling, alone and on&#xD;
-horseback, and without chain or chain carrier, would&#xD;
prove at once that he was not a surveyor, nor engaged in&#xD;
locating lands; but this does not follow at. all, or as a&#xD;
necessary consequence; for many of the old surveys in&#xD;
Kentucky, made when wild lands were of very little&#xD;
value, were located just in this reckless and unsatisfactory&#xD;
manner; the locator starting at a given point, and fol-&#xD;
lowing a certain course to another given point; blazing&#xD;
his way, counting it as so many'acres, more or less; and&#xD;
thus entering his'survey, to be at some future day a&#xD;
source of almost endless trouble and litigation. But the.&#xD;
horseman was not a surveyor, nor was he engaged in&#xD;
locating lands, and his compass was referred to merely to,&#xD;
satisfy himself as to the course of the trace, when it be-.&#xD;
came too indistinct for his unpractised eye; nor could he&#xD;
be from  the older settlements of Kentucky, for he had&#xD;
not the bold, determined, self-reliant look of one accus-&#xD;
tomed to the woods, and to the danger of a frontier-life.&#xD;
His dress .declared him a gentleman, or at. least (which&#xD;
does not always constitute agentleman) one unaccustomed,&#xD;
to labor, and familiar with the luxuries- and refinements&#xD;
of wealth and civilization; his hesitation and bewilder-&#xD;
ment. showed him to be unskilled in woodcraft; his&#xD;
swarthy complexion spoke the foreigner ; his quick, anx-&#xD;
ious glances and sudden starts exhibited the coward; and&#xD;
his own tongue made him known as an old acquaintance&#xD;
of the reader, and not at all improved in heart since last&#xD;
we saw him.&#xD;
"Sacre 1" he grumblingly exclaimed, as,  suddenly de-&#xD;
scending a steep hill, he fou4d himself in a dark, vine-&#xD;
covered dell: "Did any one ever see such a cursed&#xD;
&#xD;
country as this? Had I known the half I would undergo&#xD;
in making this trip, nothing could have induced me to&#xD;
undertake it; not even, he added, as a heavy scowl of&#xD;
hatred clouded his .sallow countenance, "the hope of re-&#xD;
venge, or the certainty of securing to myself a princely&#xD;
fortune. May the devil take me," again muttered the&#xD;
rider, as he peered down into the matted grass and wild&#xD;
vine in search of the lost trail, "if .this is what they call&#xD;
a plain bridle-path, they must have eyes sharper than&#xD;
mine, and the scent of a dog, ever to follow it up. I&#xD;
have a strong notion to turn back," he added, in a de-&#xD;
sponding tone, once more resorting to his-compass.&#xD;
"But no," he continued in a more cheerful tone, and&#xD;
with a better-satisfied look, after examining his compass,&#xD;
and discovering that he was still pursuing the direct&#xD;
route; "as I have come this far, and am now so near the&#xD;
end of my journey, I'll even press on and execute my&#xD;
little plans; for it won't do to be faint-hearted now, after&#xD;
risking so many dangers, and undergoing so many pri-&#xD;
vations in this infernal country."&#xD;
Sharply touching the flank of his  weary horse with&#xD;
the spur, the rider rode forward, at a more rapid pace;&#xD;
and the path again becoming visible, his spirits became&#xD;
more buoyant, and, once more giving vent to his secret&#xD;
thoughts, he exclaimed, but now in an elated voice-&#xD;
"I have found them at last! It was a weary hunt, but&#xD;
they can't escape me now ! The old General, curse his'&#xD;
hypocrisy, is dead at last! and he thought to swindle me&#xD;
by making a will in favor of my cousin, did.he? but he,&#xD;
forgot that'I would be the first to handle his paper, and&#xD;
so I have just suppressed that cursed maudlin, nonsen-&#xD;
sical will of his, in favor of Coma, and taken possession&#xD;
myself of the whole estateunder the old will, and as the&#xD;
rarest living relation. Ha! ha 1", laughed the, rider,-with,&#xD;
devilish glee, "wasn't it a bright idea to report this dear&#xD;
cousin of mine and her noble'husband dead-massacred by&#xD;
the Indians; and didn't I mourn her unhappy fate, and&#xD;
curse the bloody savages, and hoodwink the deer neighbors&#xD;
until they considered me the most loving and generous of&#xD;
relations? Sacre! I wishi it had been true, that:some of&#xD;

those jolly redskins had thus freed me from my enemies!&#xD;
It would have saved me a sight of trouble and money.&#xD;
But never mind, I have found them at last; they have&#xD;
no thought of what has happened, and, even if they knew,&#xD;
they would never dream that the old General had re-&#xD;
pented. I took particular. pains that he should receive&#xD;
her first letter, and that he should answer it when in a&#xD;
furious passion; cursing and disowning her forever-and&#xD;
that she should receive it. Since that time, to save his&#xD;
feelings, ha! ha!I yes, to save his feelings, I have never&#xD;
delivered any of her loving epistles, but have returned&#xD;
them unread, at least by the father; and he has never&#xD;
had an opportunity, even if he had desired it, of letting&#xD;
her know his repentance and forgiveness. Ha ! ha!"&#xD;
again laughed. the horseman, as if vastly tickled at the&#xD;
remembrance; didn't I, whenever he would talk of Coma,&#xD;
nicely lug in that fellow Head, and his father, and the&#xD;
forgery, and throw him into such a furious passion, that&#xD;
he would forget all about his love and remorse, and such&#xD;
silly stuff, and swear as if all the devils were urging him on ?&#xD;
But the old hypocrite tried to make all things right on&#xD;
his death-bed," sneered the Captain ; for the-rider, as the&#xD;
reader has already discovered, was no other than our old&#xD;
acquaintance, Ctain Jean; "and would have left me with&#xD;
a mere pittance, if I had only been ftool enough to receive&#xD;
it, and had made known his last will. But I didn't; and&#xD;
that little piece of treachery," exclaimed Montlack bit-&#xD;
terly, as if he had been really injured and' treated un-&#xD;
justly by the wish of the father to provide for his child,&#xD;
"will bring no little trouble and sorrow to this cousin of&#xD;
- mine, ori am vastly mistaken."&#xD;
Halting a moment, as if to assure himself of the path,&#xD;
which was winding along down into a deep valley, the&#xD;
horseman again  applied his spur, and pressed onwar&#xD;
exclaiming, as he4itd' so, and this time in a fierce and&#xD;
angry tone--&#xD;
"Yes! I w'in now; and it will be strange, indeed, if&#xD;
I can't mane in some way, in this wild country, where&#xD;
there are many reckless and lawlessamen (and when I&#xD;
have money plenty at control), to get clear of all my ene-&#xD;
&#xD;
mies at once, and in such a way as to secure not only re-&#xD;
venge, but my possessions."&#xD;
But scarcely had Montlack, or rather De Lacy (for he&#xD;
had along with the estate assumed the name of his uncle),&#xD;
given this confident expression respecting his villanous&#xD;
designs, when his ears were greeted bya deafening-yell,&#xD;
and six hideously painted savages, springing from their&#xD;
place of concealment, surrounded his horse, brandishing&#xD;
with threatening violence their gleaming tomahawks.&#xD;
Never the most brave,,the horrified Captain now shook&#xD;
with terror, and ere he could gather his wandering&#xD;
thoughts sufficiently, either to make an attemptat de-&#xD;
fence-or flight, was roughly dragged from his horse and&#xD;
made a prisoner. 1A moment later, and while the Captain&#xD;
still lay upon the ground panting with fright, surrounded&#xD;
by his exulting captors, a seventh savage, or rather, a&#xD;
white man in the garb of an Indian, made his appearance;&#xD;
and to the inexpressible relief of the prisoner, and' the'&#xD;
no little surprise of both parties, the companions in&#xD;
guilt, the educated and refined scoundrel and the rough,&#xD;
brutal villain, Montlack and Simon Girty were once&#xD;
more in company.&#xD;
"What in the devil's name ever brought you to this&#xD;
country !" exclaimed Girty, thus roughly giving expres-&#xD;
sion to his astonishment ; while at the same time, he con-&#xD;
templated with a smile of derision and. contempt, the ter-&#xD;
ror-stricken countenance of his olds comjanion in crime.&#xD;
"It is a long story, Girty," groane  Captain, writh-&#xD;
ing with pain, caused by the tihtlf+  :thongs with&#xD;
which his arms were bound, "and I ean'tll it now; but&#xD;
if you will only free me from these cursed bonds, I'l&#xD;
make a clean breast of it, and, what is more, tell you some-&#xD;
thing greatly to your interest."&#xD;
"Humph," muttered the renegade,with a glance at the&#xD;
Indians, "you are not my prisoner."&#xD;
"But you have influence with your  a   lylge allies !" ex-&#xD;
claimed Montlack, quickly, growing uneasyat the hesita-&#xD;

avaricious. He saw at once that his ancient employer&#xD;
was now completely inr his power, and forthwith deter-&#xD;
mined to replenish his purse by playing upon the fears&#xD;
of his prisoner. With this secret determination, to the&#xD;
suggestion of Montlack respecting his influence' with the&#xD;
savages, he only replied by shaking his head despond.&#xD;
ingly, and muttering, with a gloomy look-&#xD;
"It's a bad business, Captain; if you were my prisoner,&#xD;
I'd cut your bonds at once, but the savages have been oft&#xD;
several days in search of some one to put to the torture,&#xD;
and:you are the only captive they have made. It will be&#xD;
blasted hard to make them give you up."&#xD;
"Oh !" moaned Montlack, "I wish I had never thought&#xD;
of visiting this infernal country !"&#xD;
"It would have been better for you," said Girty,&#xD;
bluntly ,&#xD;
"Come, Simon," continued Montlack, attempting to&#xD;
shake off his fears, "don't be at any of your damned non-&#xD;
sense, but do what you can for an old friend. I was think-&#xD;
ing of you not an hour ago, and would have given five&#xD;
hundred dollars to have met you; and now, if you will&#xD;
only stand by me, and procure my freedom, I will make&#xD;
it a thousand dollars, and, moreover, aid you'in taking&#xD;
revenge upon an old enemy."&#xD;
If Girty knew what cord to touch to gain his end,&#xD;
Montlack was not ignorant or unfamiliar with the leading&#xD;
trait of the renegade's character; and at the mention of a&#xD;
reward for his services, the smile of pleasure that stole&#xD;
over the harsh features of the outlaw, told, even before he&#xD;
had spoken, the influence of gold upon his movements.&#xD;
"At some.of your old tricks, Captain, eh ?" said Girty,&#xD;
interrogatively, and in .a more pleasant voice-for with&#xD;
him, as with the molt of men, the hope of gain, and the&#xD;
tinkle of gold, w4 a great inducement to suavity.  But&#xD;
upon what pa ;icular enemy of mine would you aid me in&#xD;
taking venge ce ? I know of none, since we roped up&#xD;
the young gentleman at the haunted house on the Yad.&#xD;
kin."&#xD;
"It is of him I speak," said Montlack.&#xD;

OR, VOW FULFILLED.           85&#xD;

"The devil !" exclaimed the renegade, becoming more&#xD;
'nterested, "I thought we had fixed him for at least ten&#xD;
.ears' sojourn in the penitentiary."&#xD;
" And so we did," replied Montlack, bitterly exhibiting,&#xD;
notwithstanding his own painful and perilous situation,&#xD;
marked evidence of his anger and rage at-the memory of&#xD;
his. ancient discomfiture, "but he escaped."&#xD;
"Ha!I"&#xD;
"And more than that, married my cousin."&#xD;
"The devil!"&#xD;
"And eloped to this country; may the fiends confound&#xD;
it and him !"&#xD;
"tAmen 1"&#xD;
"And is now living in this very neighborhood."&#xD;
And you were on his trail, to take revenge, when my&#xD;
red friends put a stop to your movements ?" said Girty,&#xD;
interrogatively.&#xD;
"I was," replied Montlack, with emphasis; "and, what&#xD;
is still better for you, Simon, am ready, and able, and.&#xD;
willing, to pay handsomely to be rid of him  and his&#xD;
friends."&#xD;
"How would it answer to put him in your place, with&#xD;
these impatient allies of mine ?" said Girty, with cold-&#xD;
blooded earnestness, pointing to the savages, who seemed,&#xD;
from their lowering looks, somewhat displeased at the&#xD;
length of the conversation between the outlaw and their&#xD;
prisoner.&#xD;
"Nothing better !" exclaimed Montlack, eagerly; "and&#xD;
if you will manage to rid me of him and his wife, and his&#xD;
fast friends, Duffe and KentQn, I will be liberal with you,&#xD;
and add another thousand to my offer. But, remember," I&#xD;
continued the Captain, with sullen emphasis, "he, and this&#xD;
fellow, Kenton, must die at the stake, and I must see&#xD;
see them tortured."&#xD;
"But his wife ?' said Girty.&#xD;
"As to my cousin," replied Montla   after a moment&#xD;
of silent thought, and with a significant lock at the rene-&#xD;
gade, "if I do not conclude to take her myself, you may&#xD;
make her the squaw of one of your savages."&#xD;

Girty, with a cunning smile," to make you so anxious for&#xD;
their removal; but that is no business of mine, Captain:&#xD;
and, as you pay well, I won't pry into your affairs, but&#xD;
will seewhat can be done; for,'in revenging you, I avenge&#xD;
myself."&#xD;
"True 1" exclaimed Montlack, "and as to any motive I&#xD;
may have, Simon, that is neither here nor there, and with&#xD;
an old friend like you, and at a proper time, I would not&#xD;
hesitate to declare it; but at present;it is enough for you&#xD;
to know that I hate them all, and have cause for hatred&#xD;
and vengeance against them all, not forgetting this fel-&#xD;
low, Kenton. Their death alone will satisfy me, and for&#xD;
this satisfaction I am ready to pay well."&#xD;
"Had I known that you were so anxious for the death&#xD;
of Sharp-Iye, or Kenton," said Girty, "I could have grati-&#xD;
fied'you long ago.".&#xD;
" How?"&#xD;
"Since we met in Carolina, he was taken prisoner by&#xD;
the Indians, and condemned to the stake'; but on account&#xD;
of our old acquaintance, or for some cause I know not&#xD;
what, my heart softened towards him, and I released and&#xD;
furnished him' with means of escape I".&#xD;
" Would that you had allowed 'the savages to' roast him&#xD;
alive!" hissed Montlack, through his compressed teeth.&#xD;
He had never forgiven the Scout his forced appearance&#xD;
at the marriage of Coma, and hated him with a cordiality&#xD;
not at all inferior tothe hatred he bore Bryan.&#xD;
"Well, never mind, Captain!" laughed Girty, "he&#xD;
shan't escape next'time, for my love for him is not equal,&#xD;
by a' long way, to my love for money. The devil only&#xD;
knoWs what induced me to stand his friend then, but I&#xD;
did so; but if you know theii- whereabouts it matters but&#xD;
little, for we'll soon have them all' in our power again !"&#xD;

removed, once m   feelingg the pain of his bonds; "cut&#xD;

"Easiersi ha done !" muttered Girty; "but give me&#xD;
your promdie that you will make no attempt at escape,&#xD;
and i'll see what can be' done."&#xD;
"You hav it, of course11" said Montlack, adding, with&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, VOW FULFILLED.              37&#xD;
some appearance of alarm, as he glanced at the sullen&#xD;
countenances of his' captors; "but do you think, Girty,&#xD;
there is any doubt about my being released ?"&#xD;
"You can't count for certain on a savage in anything,&#xD;
but his taking a scalp whenever he can get it I" said Girty,&#xD;
with a dogged determination against giving any consola-&#xD;
tion to his old employer.                          *&#xD;
"But you know," said Montlack, with a quick glance&#xD;
at the sullen countenance of the outlaw, to see the effect&#xD;
of his remark ; "if I remain a captive, then you lose the&#xD;
promised reward !"&#xD;
Girty turned off without making any reply; for although&#xD;
he could but smile at the Captain's evident alarm, yet he&#xD;
was fully impressed with the force of the Captain's last&#xD;
argument ; and though he made no answer, for he wished&#xD;
to leave him in as much doubt as possible, and thereby&#xD;
render his' own services and protection the more import-&#xD;
ant, still, he saw the necessity of doing something imme-&#xD;
diately ; and with this purpose, when he had turned off&#xD;
from Montlack, approached his savage allies.&#xD;
The renegade addressed the Indians in their own tongue,&#xD;
and though Montlack, strained his ears with suspicious&#xD;
eagerness to hear what he said, he could only catch the&#xD;
deep guttural tones of his. voice, and. could make out no-&#xD;
thing.from what he heard. Girty was well aware of the&#xD;
difficulty attending his present design, and had more&#xD;
doubts than he chose-to express -of his influence with his&#xD;
savage friends ; but by skilfully praising them (a sove-&#xD;
reign lever with all classes and races of men) for their&#xD;
prowess, and py declaring the prisoner an old friend and'&#xD;
a Frenchman, which he proved to them by pointing to&#xD;
his dark skin, and by assuring them that he was an enemy&#xD;
to the white man, and ready to lead them where they&#xD;
could take many scalps and captives, and much booty,&#xD;
he at length bent them to his purposes and prevailed on&#xD;
them to relieve the Captain from his pleasant captivity.&#xD;
Once more upon his feet and unbound, Montlack reco-&#xD;
vered his spirits immediately, and would fain have had&#xD;
some farther conversation with Girty; but' the renegade&#xD;
bidding him to mount, one of the savages at his command&#xD;

38            THE WINTER LODGE; \&#xD;
&#xD;
having led forward the horse, would not listen; and with&#xD;
a significant motion of the hand stalked away, closely fol-&#xD;
lowed by three of the Indians; the four pursuing a path&#xD;
leading off in an exactly opposite direction to that which&#xD;
would have taken them to the settlements.&#xD;
Although not'a little surprised at the silence of Girty,&#xD;
and at the route he was pursuing, Montlack had no help&#xD;
for it, but to mount and follow, which he did with the&#xD;
best grace possible; the three remaining savages following&#xD;
closely behind him, carefully removing, as they went along,&#xD;
all traces of their trail.&#xD;
Scarcely had Montlack and his captors passed beyond&#xD;
the little dell where this scene had occurred, when' the&#xD;
tall person of Kenton arose from behind the trunk of an&#xD;
uprooted tree some three hundred paces distant, and the&#xD;
Scout; with a gesture of' surprise, exclaimed:-&#xD;
" Well, darn me, if them wern't Shawanees I  never&#xD;
saw an Ingen; but how the cursed devils got on this 'ere&#xD;
side of the settlement 'without leavin' any trail behind&#xD;
rather beats me!"  -&#xD;
Hardly a week had elapsed after the return of Simon&#xD;
and Titus from their long and thorough scouting expedi-&#xD;
tion, before Kenton was again on the scout. With un-&#xD;
tiring industry and perseverance they had trailed down&#xD;
the Ohio River on the north, and circled around to the&#xD;
south in their zeal, pushing boldly into the very territory&#xD;
of the Indians; 'but without seeing any hostile signs either&#xD;
of the Wyandott or Shawanee, the Creek or. the Cherokee.&#xD;
Yet for the last two weeks Sharp-Eye had again been on&#xD;
'hi lonely wanderings, and as usual had ,wept around&#xD;
north of the settlement, and 'was now nearly in a south-&#xD;
eastern direction, and on the eve of completing his circle&#xD;
before returning to the station. No wonder, then, that&#xD;
he expressed surprise at" meeting a band of Shawanees,&#xD;
apparently having ome from the south, and returning&#xD;
now, along with their captive, in the same direction. Had&#xD;
the maraudersbeen Creeks or Cherokees, or from any of&#xD;
the tribes scattered over the present State of Tennessee,&#xD;
the old Scout would have been in no way astonished; but,&#xD;
as it was,'he was completely puzzled, and sitting dow1n&#xD;
&#xD;
upon the trunk of the tree, behind which he had been&#xD;
concealed, gave expression to his troubled thoughts by&#xD;
exclaiming:--&#xD;
"Well, Bang, this 'ere sarcumstance rather heads me;&#xD;
for if them wern't Shawanees from north of the river,&#xD;
and led on too by that tarnal thief Girty, then thar's no&#xD;
use in calling' me Sharp-Eye,- and I'm no judge of yells&#xD;
and paint, and Ingen toggery. Cuss, me, old boy," con-&#xD;
tined the borderer, looking kindly into the intelligent&#xD;
'face of his dog, "if we didn't jist come in a grazer of&#xD;
gettin' ourselves into a snap by followin' after that ar'&#xD;
feller on the horse. We wern't a- minute too soon in&#xD;
droppin' behind this 'ere tree, Bang; but howsumever, we&#xD;
did it, and saved our bacon-and now we must jist try our&#xD;
hands to unravel this dratted sarcumstance."&#xD;
For ten minutes or more, Kenton silently racked his&#xD;
puzzled brain, in vain attempting to account in some rea-&#xD;
sonable way for the appearance of a band of Shawanees&#xD;
south of the settlements; but at last, giving up the attempt&#xD;
as hopeless, he sprang to his feet, exclaiming--&#xD;
"I can't do it, Bang," and thar's no use tryin'. This&#xD;
'ere business is a. puzzle to me all round ; for if it wern't&#xD;
again the, nater of things in general,. I'd swear this 'ere&#xD;
feller they've carried off wer' that rotted yeller French-&#xD;
man we left tied, some threeyears ago, in the Sargeant's&#xD;
cabin out in the Carolina. But come, old boy," he added,&#xD;
his doubting look giving place to one of intelligence&#xD;
and determination, "'twon't do for us to be fooled by a chap&#xD;
that ain't neither Ingen nor -white man, nothin' but a&#xD;
blasted renegade, as Mister Bryan calls him. Thar's only&#xD;
one way, Bang, to unravel this 'ere matter, and that's to&#xD;
take. the trail while it ar' yet warm, and jist follow the&#xD;
bloody thieves to the end of thar journey."&#xD;
Bang whined his assent to this proposition of his mas-&#xD;
ter, and the Scout, as if fully satisfied with its feasibility,&#xD;
without one thought of the danger or toil attending such&#xD;
an undertaking, proceeded at once to take the trail of the&#xD;
savages. Led by the never-failing nose of his dog, the&#xD;
borderer hurried rapidly along, at no time doubting or&#xD;
hesitating as to the trace, though the cunning Indians&#xD;

40            THE WINTER LODGE;&#xD;
&#xD;
had used every precaution to cover up and conceal all&#xD;
iark of their rapid retreat.&#xD;
For two days, to the continued and increased surprise&#xD;
of Kenton, Girty and his band of Shawanees proceeded&#xD;
to move due south, as if only anxious to escape the&#xD;
country, and with no idea-or intention of turning north.&#xD;
But the suspicious Scout was by no means satisfied with&#xD;
their apparent retreat, nor was he.lulled into the belief&#xD;
that all danger was passing away from the settlement by.&#xD;
this retrograde -move of the enemy. On the contrary,&#xD;
his doubts and fears: of some sinister intent on the part of&#xD;
the savages, were increased by this strange and unac-&#xD;
countable move of theirs; and sofar from its lulling him&#xD;
into inactivity, and putting an end to farther pursuit, it&#xD;
only strengthened his determination -to follow, and re-&#xD;
doubled his energy and perseverance. On the first night&#xD;
after the retreat of Girty, and pursuit by Kenton, the&#xD;
latter, with bold indifference to all danger, crept near&#xD;
enough to the camp fires of the enemy to assure himself&#xD;
that he was not deceived as to their being Shawanees, or&#xD;
as to the renegade being their leader; and that the cap-&#xD;
tive, who seemed on very friendly terms with his captors,,&#xD;
was in truth none other than his old foe, the Frenchman.&#xD;
Aroused to increased vigilance by this discovery, the&#xD;
iron-hearted and iron-nerved pioneer withdrew to a safe&#xD;
and convenient- distance, where, after slaking. his thirst&#xD;
from a running branch, and satisfying his hunger with a&#xD;
'handful of parched corn and jerked venison, he lay&#xD;
down and-slept, and as quietly, with no other guard but&#xD;
his faithful dog, as if surrounded by friends in a fortified&#xD;
camp, or in a peaceful home in the old States. With the&#xD;
first dawn of the succeeding day, he was up again on the&#xD;
alert, and pursuing with the faithfulness and untiring de-&#xD;
termination of a bloodhound, the fresh trace of the still&#xD;
retreating foe. On the morning of the third day, Girty&#xD;
and his party had reached that broken, hilly, and cavern-&#xD;
ous section of country, now embraced in the county of&#xD;
Edmonson; and Kenton, following closely upon their&#xD;
footsteps, suddenly, upon descending into a wild gloomy&#xD;
gorge, found himself standing at the mouth of an im-&#xD;
&#xD;
mense cavern, with the trail of the enemy,, both man and&#xD;
horse, leading directly into ,it. Not daring to enter the&#xD;
cavern, which was none otherthan the present justly cele-&#xD;
brated Mammoth Cave, the Scout, with a full sense of his&#xD;
perilous situation, but with a settled determination to un-&#xD;
ravel, if possible, the plans of the foe, busied' himself.in&#xD;
hunting. out some farther trace of the enemy. No trail&#xD;
of man or beast ever escaped his sharp vision, and whilst&#xD;
standing at the mouth of the cavern, the Scout's eagle&#xD;
eye quickly caught a faint path leading out therefrom,&#xD;
and running off in a different direction to that made by&#xD;
Girty and his band when entering. Pursuing this trail,&#xD;
it led him at once to the bank of Green River, where,&#xD;
to his inexpressible delight and satisfaction, which he&#xD;
could not help declaring both by look and voice, he dis-&#xD;
covered, safely moored in a little cove, a dozen or more&#xD;
large Indian canoes.&#xD;
" Well, blast me!" exclaimed the Scout, with a loud&#xD;
whistle of surprise, on catching sight of the savage flo-&#xD;
tilla, "if them ar' Shawanees ain't born devils for cunning,&#xD;
then I don't khow nothin'. .Who'd have thought of them&#xD;
tarnal redskins taking so much trouble to throw the&#xD;
blame of their rascality upon. the heads of the Creeks&#xD;
and Cherokees. -Drat my buttons, Bang, if I don't see&#xD;
through 'em now-and it's all as plain as the nose on my&#xD;
face. This 'ere Mister Girty, a cunning devil that he is,&#xD;
has just brought up his scalping crew from the mouth of&#xD;
the river, so as to leave no trail behind (but how he&#xD;
passed the station at Vienna, cuss me if I know), and he i&#xD;
intends, no doubt, to forage on the settlements from this&#xD;
'ere side, till he is satisfied, drop down to the Ohio,' and&#xD;
leave the Tennessee Ingens to bear the brunt of our ven-&#xD;
geance; don't you see it, Bang ?"&#xD;
Bang, like most counsellors of royalty, assented at&#xD;
once to the superior wisdom of his master; and being&#xD;
withal a dog, and not able, even if he had so desired, to&#xD;
give advice. or make suggestions, quietly submitted the&#xD;

Leaning his head upon the barrel of his long rifle,&#xD;
Kenton, with a thoughtful brow, ran over in his busy&#xD;
brain the probable designs of the enemy, and the best&#xD;
and most certain plan to defeat them.    At length,&#xD;
his eye kindling, and with a joyous laugh, as if some&#xD;
brilliant thought had just flashed upon him, the bor-&#xD;
derer shouldered his rifle, and, tightening his- belt, ex;&#xD;
claimed in merry voice, as he struck off through the&#xD;
woods-.&#xD;
"Come, Bang, my old boy, we must be 'off. I've got&#xD;

redskins; and, darn me, if I don't teach 'em a lesson&#xD;

ClHlPAPTEIR IV.-&#xD;
TREACHEROUS and deceitful himself, Montlack had very&#xD;
little confidence -in the faith of Girty; and during the first&#xD;
day of his captivity and rapid march, was made doubly&#xD;
uneasy by, the continued silence of the renegade and ttn-&#xD;
ceasing watchfulness of his savage captors.. More than&#xD;
once he had flitting thoughts of flight; but when he&#xD;
looked round upon the dense, dark forest, and caught the&#xD;
quick and suspicious glances of the Indians fastened upon&#xD;
him, his dreams of escape were gone almost as soon as&#xD;
created.&#xD;
But his heart was put at rest at their first halting-&#xD;
place ; for Qirty, relieved from, his duty as pilot and&#xD;
leader, saw proper, after his .savage friends had; fallen&#xD;
asleep, to unbosorn himself to his old employer, and fully&#xD;
&#xD;
explain his future plans, both for executing the wishes of&#xD;
Montlack, satisfying his own cravings for revenge,,and&#xD;
fulfilling at the same time the designs of his Indian&#xD;
allies.&#xD;
Content with the renegade's skilful and cunning scheme,&#xD;
which jumped with his own wicked-desires, the Captain&#xD;
rested easy and well satisfied, and made the following&#xD;
day's march in much better spirits than he had done the&#xD;
day previous. He journeyed with a light heart, almost ob-&#xD;
livious of his own situation, so confident was he now of a&#xD;
successful termination -to his-malignant plottings.&#xD;
On reaching the mouth of the cave, great as was the&#xD;
astonishment of Montlack to see Girty and his comrades&#xD;
enter without hesitation that yawning gulf, his wonder&#xD;
was increased tenfold when his captors motioned him to&#xD;
follow, and without dismounting from his horse.. Enter.&#xD;
ing some five hundred_ paces, one of the Indians leading&#xD;

hitherto surrounded him was suddenly dispelled, first by&#xD;
a few bright sparks, dropping from the steel and-flint of&#xD;
Girty, and then by a broad and cheering blaze., No&#xD;
sooner had the tall flame, springing up from a pile of dry&#xD;
fuel, interspersed with strips of resinous pine, lighted up&#xD;
the darkness, and exhibiting the- grand magnificence of&#xD;
the mighty cavern, than, far away in the distance, was&#xD;
seen another flame, as if an answering signal, and which&#xD;
was immediately greeted by loud yells from Girty and&#xD;
the savages.  Montlack started with terror; looking&#xD;
around quickly, and with an uneasy expressions for the&#xD;
yells of the agese, reverberating from point to point in&#xD;
the silence and gloom of that wonderful cave, came echo-&#xD;

but the word of the, faithless renegade, Montlack foget&#xD;
every cause of uneasiness, so totally was he .overcome by&#xD;

blaze of the flaming beacon-fire. Around him, as far as&#xD;
eye could reach,-was an impenetrable wall of heavy dark-&#xD;
ness; while, hundreds of.feet above his head, reflecting&#xD;
back the light of the fire, faint and shadowy was the&#xD;
dark gray ceiling of rugged limestone, sweeping boldly&#xD;
and magnificently away, asif mocking the vain endeavor&#xD;
of his straining vision to measure their gigantic dimen'&#xD;
sins. Profound silence reigned around hir, .unbroken&#xD;
by the sighing of the wind, or the low note of bird or&#xD;
insect; and so deep and still, was it,'that he could even&#xD;
hear, not only the.painful throbbing of his own rapidly&#xD;
pulsating heart, but of his spectre-like companions. The&#xD;
Indians, wishing to -impress the mind of their prisoner&#xD;
with the vastness, and solitude, and grandeur of their&#xD;
wonderful subterranean fastness, stood about him like&#xD;
toes, silent and immovable; watching, with&#xD;
bi      bs, ii  ,   the wild emotion painted upon his, awe-&#xD;
struck countenance, and disclosed to their eager gaze,&#xD;
by every wayward flash of their now rapidly mouldering&#xD;
beacon. But another yell from-the distant fire broke the&#xD;
mystic spell, and his captors, bidding him dismpunt,:after&#xD;
securing his horse to a broken column, once more pro-&#xD;
ce4donward, deeper and deeper into- that seemingly&#xD;
. l5ti dless and illimitable cavern. Moving steadily and&#xD;
rapidly forward,down a grand and lofty gallery, which to&#xD;
the ,re of Montlack appeared illimitable, both in height&#xD;
and width, they soon arrived at the second fire, and were&#xD;
quickly surrounded by another small party of swarthy&#xD;
and eagerly curious savages. But Girty made no delay&#xD;
at this point, and seizing a flaming torch; t egIndians all&#xD;
following his example, pressed. quikly onward, waving.&#xD;
high over his head the burning flambeaux. They were&#xD;
moving, now, along a broad and lofty avenue, and Mont-&#xD;
lack, gazing about hm with. eager curiosity, could dis-&#xD;
tinctly see the rough, dark-walls on either side, and the&#xD;
magnificent overhanging arch, sweeping grandly and&#xD;
obly in the shadowy distance above him.&#xD;
ow immense stalagmitic columns, incrusted with glit-&#xD;
tering points, would flash back the bright beams of the&#xD;
waving torches, relieving, for the moment, the sombre&#xD;
&#xD;
dreariness of those cheerless dark walls; then .came a&#xD;
sweet, low, gurgling steam of pure limpid water, flash-&#xD;
ing across his path, and remiuig him of sunshine and&#xD;
green woods, and blessed childhood ;'and then again, in&#xD;
quick succession, would roll up on either side, immense&#xD;
rugged cliffs, filling his soul, with awe at they stately&#xD;
grandeur; and once more would stretch, far away/in the&#xD;
distance, dark, gloomy passages, leading, offfrom the main&#xD;
avenue, and made only the more dreary and terrific by the&#xD;
faint and shadowy light of the passing flambeaux. Pro-&#xD;
ceeding in this manner for perhaps a mile, through every&#xD;
species of varied scenery, embracing the wild, the majes-&#xD;
tics the grand, the ,rugged, t beautiful, the cheerful, and&#xD;
the dreary, they all at once, afetitan abrupt descent of some&#xD;
twenty feet from the level passage they had hitherto been&#xD;
pursuing, entered a spacious circular room, now ealled&#xD;
the church, but at that time brilliantly lighted up by an&#xD;
immense fire placed directly in its centre, and occupied&#xD;
by a large band of Indians, the main party of Girty's&#xD;
marauding allies.&#xD;
It was a wildly picturesque scene, that spacious cham-&#xD;
ber of nature, fashioned by the will of Him who spanned&#xD;
the heavens with his omnipotent hand ; and as it spread&#xD;
out in all its grand propotions, more than a hundred&#xD;
feet in diameter, with it arci{d stone- ceiling springing&#xD;
up to the height of seventy feet, the eye of the arntazed&#xD;
beholder scanned with curious rapidity its majestic di-&#xD;
mensions, and his heart was filled with silent awe.&#xD;
Nor did the wild groupings of the savages, sleeping,&#xD;
standing, a  eclining with graceful naturalness around&#xD;
the flaming fire, detract anything from the grandeur or&#xD;
strange picturesqueness of that mysterious subterranean&#xD;
palace. Their athletic' and 'half-garbed persons, grim and&#xD;
unearthly with paint and barbarous ornament, and re-&#xD;
flected dim and shadowy, and often gigantic, against the&#xD;
surrounding wall, rather added to, than detracted&#xD;
the romantic wildness of that imposing scene.&#xD;
At the appearance of Girty and his band, along&#xD;
their pale-faced prisoner, the Indians within the chamb "&#xD;

loud yells of welcome and savage exultation.. The chief~&#xD;
tain, however, maintained his seat by the fire, exhibiting no&#xD;
emotion either of pleasure.or exultation ; but, recliing&#xD;
with easy grace and dignity upon his buffalo-robe, await-&#xD;
ed, with all the indifference and kingly nonchalance of his&#xD;
stoic race, the approach and report of his returning war-&#xD;
riors.&#xD;
He could not have, been more than fiveand-thirty years&#xD;
of age, that haughty, unexcited, and determined-looking&#xD;
savage ; and, as he lay there upon his barbarous couch,&#xD;
in his grand subterranean palace, surrounded by his wild&#xD;
warriors, presented a picture of strength and grace, and&#xD;
of manly and uncultivated beauty, but rarely equalled,&#xD;
and seldom if ever excelled.&#xD;
.The proud Shawanee chieftain, in his grandly propor-&#xD;
tioned but gloomy abode, surrounded by the athletic&#xD;
figures of his dusky and half nude followers, made out a&#xD;
scene very similar to Milton's splendid description of&#xD;
Satan, when hurled from heaven, and sitting in Pande-&#xD;
mQnium, attended by his infernal peers; and Girty, as he&#xD;
now approached to make his report and speech in behalf&#xD;
of Montlack, was a fit personification of the dark browed,&#xD;
down-looking, and avaricious Mammon:-&#xD;
" Mammon, the least erected spirit that fell&#xD;
From heaven;-for even in heaven his looks and thoughts&#xD;
Were always downward bent ; admiring more&#xD;
The riches of heaven's pavement,,trodden gold,&#xD;
Than aught divine, or holy else enjoyed&#xD;
In visionbeatific.'&#xD;
Anxious to fulfil the wishes of Montlaclkand thereby&#xD;
satisfy his own malevolent feelings toward&amp;amp;6our hero, and&#xD;
at the same time (which was of far greater weight with&#xD;
him, than, either love or hate) gain the large reward&#xD;
offered by his employer, the renegade approached the&#xD;
Indian chieftain with many fears, for he was by no means&#xD;
Satisfied that he could bend him to his plan, or even save&#xD;
life of the trusting Captain. He knew that the sa-&#xD;
were determined upon sacrificing some pale-faced&#xD;
ner to the spirits of their departed friends, before&#xD;
making their contemplated attack upon the settlements,&#xD;
&#xD;
and that the greatcave, which was a holy and sacred place&#xD;
in their estimation, was to be the scene of the .bloody&#xD;
offering. Indeed, he had been sent out to seize the vic-&#xD;
tim; and now only returned, was ignorant that his savage&#xD;
allies had, during his absence, taken a prisoner, and were&#xD;
now waiting his presence, and the corning of the young&#xD;
warriors, to offer him up as a propitiatory sacrifice to the&#xD;
Great Spirit. Ignorant of this fact, which would have&#xD;
greatly relieved his fears, had he only known it, Girty,&#xD;
with many doubts as to the success of his schemes, drew&#xD;
near, and stood without speaking in the presence of the&#xD;
Indian chieftain.&#xD;
"My white brother will speak ?" said the Shawanee,&#xD;
waving his hand to Girty.&#xD;
"The Great Chief sent his white brother with the young&#xD;
warriors, to spy out the lodges of the pale face. Seven&#xD;
suns have come and gone since we sought the trail of the&#xD;
Long-knife. The young warriors have kept the path, and&#xD;
not slept."&#xD;
"The ear of the Great Chief is open, he hears the voice&#xD;
of his white brother," muttered the Shawanee.&#xD;
"The young warriors of the Great Chief." continued&#xD;
Girty, "have seen the wigwams of the pale face. They&#xD;
are scattered thick over the hunting-grounds of my red&#xD;
brother, like the lodges of the Long-knife where the sun&#xD;
rises, beyond the great mountains."&#xD;
"Tis well, Sai the Shawanee, with an impatient ges-&#xD;
ture; " the Great Chief and his warriors will take many&#xD;
scalps. My white brother has not lost his tongue.&#xD;
"The young warriors, said the renegade with some&#xD;
hesitation, "have not taken any scalps. They were not&#xD;
upon the war-path; but they have followed the dark trail,&#xD;
and can guide the great brave of the Shawanees. to the&#xD;
lodges of the sleeping pale face."&#xD;
"My children are not fools,"'said the chieftain, with.:&#xD;
glance at the party of Girty; "they know when to&#xD;
the tomahawk like warriors, and when to lie like a&#xD;
in the tall grass; they have obeyed the comma&#xD;
their father, and done well. The Shawanee warrior&#xD;

braves."r~ bohr&#xD;
"My red brothers did not shut their eyes while on the&#xD;
frailf the pale face,"- continued Girty, with an uneasy&#xD;
glaIe at Montlack. "They have brought a prisoner to&#xD;
the Great Chief; but the Great Chief will give his hand to&#xD;
the captive, and call him brother, when he hears the words&#xD;
of hlis white brave."&#xD;
A murmur of dissatisfaction greeted this speech of the&#xD;
renegade; but the Indian chief,looking gravely around,&#xD;
replied-&#xD;
"My white brother whispers a strange story into the&#xD;
ear of the Great Chief of the Shawanee braves; but let&#xD;
him speak, for the Great Chief will Trot shut his ear to&#xD;
the words of his white warrior. His ear is still open,&#xD;
and he will listen to what his white brother has to say ;&#xD;
for he knows he-will speak the words of wisdom, and not&#xD;
with' a forked tongue."&#xD;
"The prisoner of the young braves is the friend of the&#xD;
Great Chief's white brother," continued Girty, "and his&#xD;
heart is open to the wrongs of the red man. He hates&#xD;
the Long-knife, and is a friend to the Shawanee."&#xD;
"The Great Chief is not blind," replied the Shawanee,&#xD;
looking sharply into the face of Girty, "and his white&#xD;
brother must not-speak with a lying tongue. The young&#xD;
braves have taken the pale face upon their war-path into&#xD;
the country of the Long-knife, and their white brother&#xD;
will not speak with a double tongue, to turn aside the&#xD;
tomahawk of the red warrior."-&#xD;
"The Great Chief of the Shawanees," replied Girty,&#xD;
leading Montlack into the full light of the blazing fire,&#xD;
is not blind; he has the, eye of the soaring eagle, and.&#xD;
knows a pale face whenever he sees him. He will look&#xD;
the prisoneriand say whether his white warrior&#xD;
oken witly a dying tongue. The friend of his white&#xD;
is a Frenchman, and the brother of the red man.&#xD;

w  iors where they may take many scalps. My&#xD;
o    cannot be deceived; let him look upon the&#xD;
&#xD;
prisoner and tell his young warriors if their white brother&#xD;
is a fool."&#xD;
Rolling his burning orbs over the face of Montlack,&#xD;
who, at a hint from Girty, struggled to bear the scrutiny&#xD;
with an air of quiet fearlessness, the Shawanee, at&#xD;
length, as if satisfied, exclaimed with deep and guttural&#xD;
emphasis-&#xD;
"My white brother has not spoken with - forked&#xD;
tongue!  His words are the words-of wisdom!- The&#xD;
prisoner is not one of our pale-faced enemies, but a fol-&#xD;
lower of our: good father over the great waters. He is&#xD;
welcome ; the Great Chief of the Shawanees will give&#xD;
his hand to his new brother."&#xD;
Girty interpretiig the wish of the chief, fpr the conver-&#xD;
sation had been carried on in the Shawanee tongue, Mont-&#xD;
lack gladly grasped tihe proffered hand of his new friend;&#xD;
all parties, or at least the renegade and Captain, being&#xD;
highly delighted that the interview had, terminated - so&#xD;
pleasantly.&#xD;
The savages, who had hitherto been standing around&#xD;
in groups, gravely listening to the talk of Girty and their&#xD;
chieftain, no sooner saw Montlack received as a friend by&#xD;
the latter, than with one accord, they began to prove-their&#xD;
love for the smirking Frenchman, by giving him many&#xD;
warm and very feeling fraternal hugs. His reception&#xD;
could not have been more affectionate, and the Captain,&#xD;
with the politeness of his nation, strove to receive their&#xD;
savage demonstrations of love in good part; but in&#xD;
spite of all his efforts, much to the amusement of Girty,&#xD;
and also to:the seeing delight of the Shawanee leader,.&#xD;
gave many shrugs, and no few groans of pain, under the&#xD;
crushing embraces of his brawny red brothers. -But at&#xD;
length, having received-the welcome, and returned the&#xD;
"how de do, broder," of eyery'sayage present, the Captain,&#xD;
with a heated brow, and countenance almost as red as t&#xD;
vermilion-colored faces of his new friends, was left&#xD;

terpreter, "is glad to see his French brother in the mighty&#xD;
lodge of the Great Prophetess of the  ed man."&#xD;
"'is a grand wigwam," replied Montlack, naturally&#xD;
falling into the style of the : Shawanee, and throwing out&#xD;
his hands to express a sense of the vastney of the cavern;&#xD;
"a fit lodge for my red brother, the Great Chief of the&#xD;
Shawanees."&#xD;
"My French brother has seen nothing," replied the&#xD;
chief. "It would take many moons to travel over the&#xD;
Big Lodge of the Great Spirit, and see its many wonders."&#xD;
"Are the rooms and paths of this mighty lodge all&#xD;
known to my red brother?" inquired Montlack.&#xD;
"Not all," replied the Shawanee; "they were all&#xD;
known to the father of'the Great Chief; but since. the&#xD;
coming of the pale face, and departure of the mighty&#xD;
Prophetess of the red man, many of the paths of the.&#xD;
Great Lodge have been lost to the Shawanee brave."&#xD;
"Did the Great Prophetess of my brother," said Mont..&#xD;
lack, becoming interested in the wild legend of the savage,&#xD;
"live in this mighty lodge now occupied by the Shawanee&#xD;
Chief and his warriors ?"&#xD;
"Many moons ago,"-replied the savage, "when the&#xD;
father of the Great Chief led the warriors of the Shawanee&#xD;
to battle; before the hunting-grounds of the red man were&#xD;
trailed by the pale-faced hunter, the Great' Prophetess held&#xD;
her council-fire in this mighty lodge, and all the tribes of&#xD;
the North.and South came-every twelve moons to learn&#xD;
wisdom, and hear from their departed friends in the 'happy&#xD;

and burial-place of the mighty braves, was only a short&#xD;

received the spirits of dead warriors, and led them along&#xD;
secret paths to join their departed friends across the 'dark&#xD;
waters;' and here she talked words of wisdom to the liv-&#xD;
ing braves, and bore their messages to the warriors gone&#xD;
on their long journey to the spirit-land!"&#xD;
"And did the Great Prophetess of the red 'man die ?"&#xD;
asked Montlack, becoming, more and more interested in&#xD;
the wild tradition of-the Shawanee; the vehenience of the&#xD;
swarthy warrior, and the gloomy and .unearthly scene&#xD;
around him, giving a force and air of truthfulness to the&#xD;
chief's legend, and lending an interest that would not&#xD;
otherwise have been connected with so strange a story.&#xD;
"My French brother speaks with the tongue of a silly&#xD;
squaw !" said the Shawanee, scornfully ; "the  Prophetess&#xD;
of the red man wa placed in this. great lodge by the&#xD;
Manitou of the Indian, and could not die. She forbade my&#xD;
father, and the tribes of the North, and the red warriors&#xD;
from the South, from building their lodges in this land of&#xD;
the buffalo and elk ; and it was kept as a common hunt-&#xD;
ing-ground for all the nations, from the big lakes in the&#xD;
North to the salt waters in the South. The Great Spirit&#xD;
never permitted the game to grow scarce, and. at times&#xD;
the dead warriors were brought back from the spirit-land&#xD;
to. follow the chase for a season in their old hunting.&#xD;
grounds!"&#xD;
* Will the Great Chief tell 'his white brother why the&#xD;
Prophetess of the red man departed from the Big Lodge,&#xD;

"When the pale face came from towards the rising&#xD;

had ever been permitted to stand; and when she beheld&#xD;

to the spirit-land,, her heart" grew 'faint and sad, and she&#xD;
departed to another great lodge, somewhere near the set-&#xD;
ting sun, across the great father of waters. But she did&#xD;
not entirely desert her children !" continued the Shawa-&#xD;
neea gleam of joy spreading over his sad face and driving&#xD;
away its gloom; "for she left her sacred body behind, to&#xD;
guard this last trail of the red man from the keen eye of&#xD;
the pale-faced destroyers of her race, and to warn back the&#xD;
warriors of the.spirit-land, when they should again come&#xD;
forth to seek their old hunting-grounds ."&#xD;
"And does she never return to meet the Shawanee&#xD;
brave, and 'guide him along the dark paths of her old&#xD;
lodge ?" said Montlack.&#xD;
"The Great Prophetess will not forget her children&#xD;
among the Shawanees !" replied the chief, looking proudly&#xD;
around upon his silent warriors; "'she knows they have&#xD;
not yet buried the tomahawk, and are still battling with the&#xD;

the spirits of fallen braves and guide them safely to the&#xD;
blessed abodes of the dead, beyond the dark waters !"&#xD;
"Has my red brother ever looked upon the body of'&#xD;
the Great Prophetess ?" said Montlack, doubtingly.&#xD;
" The Great Chief never speaks with a lying tongue 1,&#xD;
replied-the Shawabee, his swarthy face flushing up at the&#xD;
doubt implied by Montlack's question.&#xD;
"Will my red brother permit his'white brother to be-&#xD;
hold this wonderful sight?" said Montlack, still doubting,&#xD;
although somewhat staggered by the strange legend, sup-&#xD;
ported as it was by the positive affirmation of the grave.&#xD;
my French brother may no longer think the&#xD;
ee brave to speak with the lying tongue of the&#xD;
ce, the Great Chief will but speak with his warriors&#xD;
en lead hiin to behold the wonders of the Big Lodge,&#xD;
&#xD;
and to look, if he wills it, upon the holy body of the Great&#xD;
Prophetess !"&#xD;
" His white brother," replied Montlack, "will not for-&#xD;
get the kindness of the Great Chief and will tell his father&#xD;
across the salt waters all the wonders he has seen in the&#xD;
big wigwam of the. red man i".'_&#xD;
"Tis well !" said the Shawanee; "my white brother&#xD;
speaks with the soft tongue of the singing-bird, and his&#xD;
words, like the voice of the young squaw, are very plea-&#xD;
sant to his red brother. But the ear of the Great Chief&#xD;
is now closed ; he would talk with his warriors."&#xD;
The chief having thus signified his intention to hold a&#xD;
council of his braves, at a sign from Girty, Montlack&#xD;
arose from his seat by, the fire, and followed him to a dis-&#xD;
tant part of the cavern.&#xD;
Left to themselves, the Shawanee chieftain and his war-&#xD;
riors drew nearer together, and were soon  engaged in&#xD;
grave deliberation. The result of their council will be&#xD;
made known in our next chapter.&#xD;

and his warriors, for, the word Qf the former having been&#xD;

&#xD;
council, without delay or ceremony, was broken up, each&#xD;
warrior hurrying away to prepare, either 'to follow the&#xD;
chieftain in his pilgrimage to the body of the Prophetess,&#xD;
or to get ready the necessary materials for consummating&#xD;
the horrid ceremonial to be performed upon his return.&#xD;
At a word from his leader, a dark-browed,.sullenwarrior&#xD;
picked out some twenty young braves, and with thep&#xD;
proceeded at once towards the mouth of the cavern,&#xD;
whilst the remainder of the savages-some thirty in num-&#xD;
ber-their chieftain setting them the example, busied&#xD;
themselves in getting ready.for the contemplated visit to&#xD;
the tomb of the Great Prophetess. Viewing it in the&#xD;
light of a religious ceremony, and one of no little im-&#xD;
portance, in their estimation, the Indians, with supersti-&#xD;
tious reverence, bent every effort to put themselves in a&#xD;
suitable trim for this solemn expedition. With as much&#xD;
zeal and care as ever a beauty did in her secret boudoir,&#xD;
each warrior added a fresh coat of paint to his already&#xD;
disfigured countenance ; and this done to his satisfaction,&#xD;
next sought.out some little barbaric ornament to carry&#xD;
with him, and leave with idolatrous devotion at the shrine&#xD;
of the Prophetess. The, chief having painted himself&#xD;
with great care, to perfect his toilet, clasped around his&#xD;
neck-and with as proud a smile as ever a queen did&#xD;
when clasping a circlet of diamonds-a necklace of bloody&#xD;
scalp-locks; and then, girding his' blanket tightly and&#xD;
gracefully around his athletic person with a brilliant belt&#xD;
of wampum, so as to leave his right arm naked, and un-&#xD;
impeded by his dress, he took from the hand of the nearest&#xD;
warrior a flaming torch of resinous pine, and, with a&#xD;
haughty gesture to his followers, stepping a pace towards&#xD;

"The Great Chief and his braves are ready to look&#xD;
upon the face of their' sleeping mother. My white bro-'&#xD;

ithout-waiting the reply or assent of Montlack, the&#xD;
4w'Twaie placed himself at the head of his warriors, and.&#xD;
pasing fom the circular room they had hitherto been&#xD;
&#xD;
occupying, entered at an easy and regular ascent a broad&#xD;
and lofty avenue. Following this avenue, and moving&#xD;
along in silence, they had gone, perhaps, the third of a&#xD;
mile, and may-be more, when, the chief halted .suddenly,&#xD;
and pointing upwards with his torch to a narrow gallery&#xD;
sweeping. across the maincave, remarked-&#xD;
." My white brother would see the body of the red&#xD;
man's mother; the big tomb is up there! will he go ?"&#xD;
Montlack expressed his willingness.&#xD;
"The Great Chief of the Shawanees," continued the&#xD;
savage, " has promised his pale-faced brother to lead him&#xD;
along the winding paths of the Big Lodge to the body of&#xD;
the Prophetess. . He has not a forked tongue, to promise&#xD;
one thing and do another. My white brother is no&#xD;
squaw, and the Great Chief does rgot follow an unknown&#xD;
trail."&#xD;
Moving onward, the chief ascended by a narrow flight&#xD;
of rough steps to the gallery he had pointed out, and,&#xD;
when once there, turning off short to the right, entered&#xD;
a magnificent apartment more than two. miles in length,&#xD;
forty feet high, and twenty wide. It was a scene of fairy&#xD;
beauty, and, of surpassing magnificence-that long and&#xD;
broad avenue-with its pillars:of white and translucent&#xD;
stalagmites, its floor of crystallized salts, and ceiling white&#xD;
and smooth as if made by the cunning hand of the skilful&#xD;
plasterer.-.&#xD;
" My white brother sees the tomb of the Great Pro-&#xD;
phetess," said the chief, solemnly. "The Good Spirit has&#xD;
made it grand and beautiful, that the braves of her race&#xD;
may not be ashamed of the grave of their mother. The&#xD;
Shawanee warriors will looks again upon the face of their&#xD;
Prophetess, and my white brother need. not shut his&#xD;
eyes.&#xD;
The Indians, proceeding for a short space along this&#xD;
broad avenue, their steps gradually becoming slower and&#xD;
slower, and their faces expressing increased reverence&#xD;
and awe as they approached nearer and nearer th F&#xD;
of their superstitious veneration, the chief again ma&#xD;

to:the inexpressible wonder of Montlack,. it gave forth a&#xD;
smothered solemn sound, like the deep-toned bell of a&#xD;
cathedral; the rocks, and corners, and arches of the old.&#xD;
cave echoing back its swellig notes, as if theanswering&#xD;

"The Great Chief has sent his mother warning    he&#xD;

astonishment of Montlack and of some of ,the youger&#xD;
trriors; "he must- not stealrlike a prowling wolf into&#xD;
the sacred presence of the Prophetess.&#xD;
in a deep guttural voice, the chief now,,commenced a&#xD;
wild chant, which was immediately taken up aid repeated&#xD;
by his ,warriors, and in this manner they continued their&#xD;
solemn march, no longer holimg aloft their torches but&#xD;
pointing them sadly to the earth, in the fashion of soldiers&#xD;
when paying-the ,last rites to a dead comrade. Chanting&#xD;
this barbaric dirge, the savages, with their half nude&#xD;
persons, flaming torches, and grotesquely-painted faces,&#xD;
presented an unearthly, wizard-like assemblage,. not&#xD;
unworthy of the gloomy grandeur of that wonderful&#xD;
subterranean chamber. They had progressed in this. man-&#xD;
ner some distance beyond the mysterious bell, when sud-&#xD;
denly, at a wave from their chieftain's torch, they savages,&#xD;
kneeling, formed, a crescent of flaming fire around a small&#xD;
recess or antechamber, which was now distinctly visible,&#xD;
although elevated some feet above the level of thefloor.&#xD;
Within this small chamber, now brilliantly lighted up,&#xD;
by the combined flame of thirty torches, itcrystallized&#xD;
formations, and translucent stalactites reectang back the&#xD;
light with dazzling lustre, Montlack, with a thrill of&#xD;
superstitious awe, beheld the stark ,bodies of two grim&#xD;
warriors, in a sitting posture, l .  gast the extreme&#xD;
wall of the recess and to aU ap nee as perfect as if&#xD;

&#xD;
hands folded across his breast, as if in deep sorrow, then&#xD;
drawing his gleaming tomahawk, he went through ith&#xD;
some mystic legendary ritual, after which he brandished' it&#xD;
fiercely around his head, and grasping with his left hand&#xD;
the imaginary scalp-lock of some enemy, broke the deep&#xD;
silence of the cavern with a terrific yell. This done, as&#xD;
the wild echo of his voice died away in the distance, with&#xD;
gloomy brow, he chanted:&#xD;
"The Great Chief would awaken his red brothers from&#xD;
their long sleep;&#xD;
"But their ears are closed, and they hear him not.&#xD;
"The Prophetess of the red man has passed to the,&#xD;
spirit-land;-&#xD;
"And along with her the spirits of the slumbering&#xD;

They sit now, lonely and silent, by the body of their&#xD;

their ears.&#xD;
" Their eyes are closed and heavy.  The gleaming&#xD;

"They. await the coming of their dead mother to guide&#xD;

"The Shawanee braves but wait the coming of the Gret&#xD;

"tetnmy mother hear and be glad.".&#xD;
This wild. chant or monody of the chief finished, he&#xD;
beckoned one of his warriors, and approaching the recess,&#xD;
entered the little antecham ber. The.two living savages&#xD;
stood now immediately between and almost touching the&#xD;
stiff and-rigid forms -of the fabled champions of the Pro-&#xD;
phetess. After a moment spent in brushing away a slight&#xD;
covering of fine sand, the chief and the warrior, stooping&#xD;
down, by their united effort, raised a broad slab of stone,&#xD;
about four feet long and as many wide, exposing to view&#xD;
a square excavation about three feet deep and as many&#xD;
in length and breadth. This done, the warrior immediately&#xD;
retired, leaving the chief standing alone. He stood perhaps&#xD;
a minute by the side.of the pit; but when the. warrior had&#xD;
rejoined his. comrades, stooped and reverently removed a&#xD;
thin matting made from the inner bark of some tree, fully&#xD;
exposing, as he did so, all the wggders of that mysterious&#xD;
nether subterranean tomb. After a short space of solemn&#xD;
silence, the Shawanee, maintaining his position by the pit,&#xD;
and the Indians kneeling with awe-struck countenances&#xD;
around the former, turned to where Montlack stood, saying:&#xD;
"The Great. Chief is once more=in the presence of his&#xD;
mother. Will my white: brother look upon the face of&#xD;
the great Prophetess, and know that his red brother does&#xD;
not speak with a lying tongue ?"&#xD;
With some degree ,of trepidation, which he could not&#xD;
entirely conceal, for his mind was  onfused, and he was in&#xD;
doubt what to think of the wonderful subterranean abode&#xD;
into which he had been so unexpectedly introduced, and&#xD;
*ith his thoughts'whirling with the strange and mysteri-&#xD;
';,  scenes: he =had already witnessed, Montlack, at the&#xD;
request of tjaN savage, silently entered the little ante-&#xD;
chamberut hesitating, he halted near the threshold'&#xD;
&#xD;
gazing with a look of wondering terror upon the -grim&#xD;
and hideous countenances of the two dead warriors.&#xD;
"My white brother is no squaw," said the Indian, with&#xD;
a slight smile of contempt; "the two braves have been&#xD;
sleeping there since my father led the warrior of the&#xD;
Shawanee-to battle. They will never awake agaif They&#xD;
.have hands, but can neVer again hurl the tomahawk; have&#xD;
ears, but cannot hear; have mouths, but cannot give the&#xD;
scalp-halloo.  They 'are sleeping their long sleep, my&#xD;
red brothers, and only when the red man has been driven&#xD;
towards the setting sun, across the father of waters, will&#xD;
they wake from their slumber, and go away, by the dark'&#xD;
paths of their Big Lodge, to the spirit-land."&#xD;
Partly shaking off his fears, Montlack drew near to the&#xD;
side of' the Indian, and there, at his very feet, in solemn&#xD;
and lonely silence, sat a tall female* in perfect preserva-&#xD;
tion. She had-a rich but barbarous robe of skin gathered&#xD;
gracefully around her person, and savage ornaments of&#xD;
various descriptions were scattered profusely about her.&#xD;
It was the traditionary mother of the red man, the Great&#xD;
Prophetess of the Big Lodge. Her body was placed in a&#xD;
sitting, posture, with her arms folded up, and with her&#xD;
hands laid across her bosom; whilst around and about&#xD;
her were sheets of fine batk matting, and.various kinds ot&#xD;
skins, beautifully ornamented with leaves and vines ; and&#xD;
at her side lay a ;pair of moccasons, a knapsack, and a&#xD;
reticule. These latter articles were all made of wove or&#xD;
knit bark, and .fancifully and grotesquely ornamented&#xD;
with borders -brilliantly colored, and secured by loops&#xD;
and cords; and in and about them were various orna-&#xD;
ments, portions of dress, and instruments of female indus:'&#xD;
try.&#xD;
t "My white brother will no longer 'doubt the word of&#xD;
the Great Chief," said the Shawanee, after waiting a short&#xD;
space for Montlack to satisfy his curiosity; "for he is not&#xD;
blind, and before him is the body of the-Great Prophet&#xD;
ess."&#xD;
* The body of this female, and the two Indians, and all the ornamental&#xD;
mentioned, were discovered a few years since in the cave.-CoLtina's is-&#xD;

"My red brother speaks with the tongue of truth," re-&#xD;
plied M~ntlack, "and his white brother is satisfied."&#xD;
Taking from the excavation the knapsack, the chief&#xD;
opened it, and, after drawing therefrom ipany gaudy head-.&#xD;
dresses and, mantles, all curiously made of colored quills,&#xD;
anddecorated with the rich -and brilliant plumage of&#xD;
birds, exclaimed, with a gleam of pride and satisfaction,,&#xD;
as he held them up to the.gaze of Montlack:==&#xD;
"These were the ornaments worn by the Prophetess of.&#xD;
the red man. when she came forth to meet the assembled&#xD;
braves of her. race. These," he continued, holding up a&#xD;
necklace made from the red hoof of the fawn, the claw of&#xD;
an eagle, and jaw of a_ bear, "are emblematical ofher&#xD;
sway over the hunting-grounds of our race. These," he&#xD;
* added, exhibiting two immense rattlesnake skins,. "show&#xD;
that she had all the cunning and wisdom of the-snake,&#xD;
and would be a deadly foe. And these," he continued, a&#xD;
shade of gloom flitting across his brow, as he held up two&#xD;
whistles, "were once used by our good mother to sum-'&#xD;
mon to her presence the warriors of her race; but now&#xD;
they are only needed when she comes once every twelve&#xD;
moons to gather together the spirits of the braves wan-&#xD;
dering through the unknown paths of the Big Lodge, to&#xD;
lead them to the happy huntinggrounds across the dark&#xD;
waters."            .&#xD;
"And this-why is it here ?" said Montlack, pointing&#xD;
to the reticule.&#xD;
"To hold the gifts of her children," said the chief, at&#xD;
the same time drawing, from his bosom a richly orna-&#xD;
mented pair of moccasons, and, placing them therein-&#xD;
"and now, as my white brother is satisfied, and the Great&#xD;
Chief has looked upon the face of his mother, he will&#xD;
permit the warriors of .his tribe; to approach and deliver&#xD;
their offerings.'&#xD;
Montlack, at aimotion from the chieftain's hand, having&#xD;
itred; at the command of their leader, the savages, one&#xD;
t a time, and by rotation, left the crescent,,and entered&#xD;
the little chamber containing the body of the Prophetess.&#xD;
After standifig a moment by the side of the pit, looking&#xD;
solemnly down at the lonely figure sitting there i silence&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
and solitude, they would deposit their gifts, and r+ -me&#xD;
their places in the circle, until the entire band had in a&#xD;
like manner gratified their curiosity, or rather, religious&#xD;
zeal. The chief, and the warrior who had aided him in&#xD;
removing the slab, again replaced it over thetormb; then,&#xD;
throwing a necklace of bear's claws around the neck&#xD;
of each of the dead warriors, the two retired to the main&#xD;
avenue, and the ceremony was ended.&#xD;
"Does my white brother wish .to see more of the Big&#xD;
Lodge ? inquired the chief; as he once more placed him-&#xD;
self at the head of his followers.&#xD;
. " The wonders of the Big Lodge are all new to the&#xD;
Great Chief's white brother," replied Montlack; "and if&#xD;
the Shawanee brave will lead, his pale-faced brother will&#xD;
follow."&#xD;
"Tis well !" said the chief, with a proud smile, "my&#xD;
brother speaks the words of wisdom. The pale face has&#xD;
no lodge like the lodge of the Great Prophetess=; and my&#xD;
white brother may tell his father, when he crosses the salt&#xD;
water, all the wonders his Shawanee brother has shown&#xD;
him."&#xD;
Passing -onward, along the same beautiful avenue they&#xD;
had as yet been following, the chief led Montlack through&#xD;
many grand and magnificent apartments, all glittering&#xD;
with pure white pillars, fluted columns,'straight and fanci-&#xD;
ful stalactites, and floor of crystallized salts, relieved now&#xD;
and then by dim and shadowy domes, huge rugged cliffs&#xD;
of dark gray stone, and bright purling streams of pure&#xD;
waters flashing .across their path. It was a wild and fairy&#xD;
scene throughout ; a mingling together of the grand, the&#xD;
beautiful, and magnificent ; and Montlack, forgetting all&#xD;
things else, could onlygive expression, in broken excla-&#xD;
mations of delight, to hise&amp;amp;cntinued wonder and astonish-&#xD;
ment. Turning back and retracing his steps, the savage&#xD;
once more entered the main cave,and after a few.;&#xD;
nutes' rapid walk,stopped suddenly, and gave a loud,&#xD;
longed yell, and his followers; throwingthemselves sqm&#xD;
twenty feet apart,.in a continued line, greeted the yell&#xD;
their chief with an answering shout, at th same time&#xD;
holding aloft their torches, so as to fully illuminate a&#xD;

m g~ificent room, several hundred feet in length, fifty or&#xD;
mQreinwidth, with  high arched ceiling; and a broad&#xD;
gallery stretching the entire length of the apartment.&#xD;
The floor of this chamber wasof smooth and hard sand,&#xD;
like the- beach of the ocean; and during the moment of,&#xD;
silence following the yell of the savages, Montlack could&#xD;
distinctly heathe faint, distant hum of tumbling Waters.&#xD;
" The Great Chief," said the Shawanee," has led his&#xD;
white brother tq the drance-rbomo-4f the red man. The&#xD;
wad-dance of the various tribes, once every twelve moons,&#xD;
were performed here under the eye of the. Prophetess.&#xD;
If my brother would see the war-dance of the Shawanee,&#xD;
the young warriors are ready."&#xD;
Montlack having signified his desire to witness the&#xD;
performance, at a signal from their chief, about one half&#xD;
of the savages, forming'into a ring, commenced their&#xD;
wild and uncouth national dance. It was an unearthly&#xD;
and wizard-like scene, that dance of the Shawanee war-&#xD;
rior, by torch-light, in that grand subterranean ball-room ;&#xD;
and as their half nude,'barbarously painted persons flitted&#xD;
dimly through the mazy evolutions of this barbaric sport,,&#xD;
they resembled more a company of fierce demons, moving&#xD;
to the wail of the howling damned, than anything else.&#xD;
But at a wave of their chieftain's torch the sport ceased,&#xD;
the war-song was over, the dance ended ; and the great.&#xD;
ball-room of the Big Lodge was again- lonely and de-&#xD;
serted.&#xD;
Once more proceeding onward,'- they passed through&#xD;
many vast. halls, and avenues, and immense amphithea-&#xD;
tres, all grand and lofty and magnificent ; and many of&#xD;
them reflecting back with sparkling brilliancy the flash-&#xD;
ing light of the passing torches, proved to the astonished&#xD;
vision of Montlack, that they too, like the other cham-&#xD;
bers he had examined, were beautified with rich and&#xD;
y anciful incrustations, But merely passing through these,&#xD;
if they were nothing uncominon, the Shawanee con-&#xD;
tnued to move, rapidly onward, until he had entered a&#xD;
vast and gloomy chamber, with a lofty and scarcely per-&#xD;
ceptible ceiling; then halting, he with a proud smile&#xD;
threw his and aloft, exclaiming:-&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
"If my white brother would see the heavens, let, him&#xD;
look! The Great Spirit has covered the Big Lodge of&#xD;
our mother with a tent of stars."&#xD;
Following with his eyes the upraised hand of the sa-&#xD;
vage, 'Montlack started back with an exclamation of as-&#xD;
tonishment ; for there, sure -enough, far away above him&#xD;
was to all appearance the firmament,* spread out in all&#xD;
its glory, with its rolling clouds, studded with bright&#xD;
stars; and still further in the ditance a flaming comet&#xD;
with its long white tail.&#xD;
"It is a custom of our race," said the chief, as if in ex-&#xD;
planation, " to sleep much in the open air under the broad&#xD;
heavens; so that our eyes, when enclosed, if only for a&#xD;
moment, may ever look up at the camp-fires of the good&#xD;
angels.- The Great Father of the red man did not forget&#xD;
this Custom of his children, and, in building the Big&#xD;
Lodge, covering the paths leading to the happy hunting-&#xD;
grounds beyond the grave, he -spread out, as you see,. those&#xD;
clouds and stars, to cheer up and make glad the drooping&#xD;
heart of the wandering brave. The Manitou of the red-&#xD;
man is not blind, he knows all things, and is not deaf to&#xD;
the cries of his children. He saw that the braves were&#xD;
sad, wandering through the dark paths of the Big Lodge,&#xD;
when they could not see the camp-fires flaming above&#xD;
them-and he spread- out the heavens as a tent of stars&#xD;
to make them glad!"&#xD;
Halting a few moments to permit Montlack and his fol-&#xD;
lowers to enjoy a passing glance at the, singular optical&#xD;
illusion exhibited in this chamber of the firmament, with&#xD;
its stars, and comet, and clouds, the Shawanee again re-&#xD;
sumed his march, and after passing through many wind-&#xD;
ing avenues,, and by rich grottos, and at the foot of a&#xD;
beautiful cataract, but without making any stay at either,&#xD;
he at length entered a grand and circular room, the regiee&#xD;
now called the Temple,!&#xD;
"My white brother," said the Indian, when he 14&#xD;

instigated by religious zeal, sank into insignifcance, when&#xD;

of gray limestone, and the walls swept awayon every&#xD;

plumb and square. The, heart ofl.Montlack, as his eye&#xD;

.After leaving the Temple, or Great Council Chamber,&#xD;
the savage again leading his wildly picturesque band of&#xD;
swart warriors, continued steadily onward, until he stood&#xD;
upon the confines of what is now called the Bottomless&#xD;
Pit. Slowly waving his torch, showing, close at his feet, the&#xD;
gloomy horrors of that terrible place, the Shawanee king,&#xD;
with a voice of sadness, said to Montlack, who had drawn&#xD;
back with a shudder from the immediate brink of the&#xD;
yawning gulf---&#xD;
"My white brother beholds the dark entrance leading&#xD;
to the land of the bad spirits ; over this bottomless pit,"&#xD;
continued the chief, hurling a large stone down into the&#xD;
gloomyichasm, which could be heard bounding froni&#xD;
point to point, and rumbling and. tossing in the distant&#xD;
darkness, "the spirits of all our race have to pass, before&#xD;
they can reach the happy hunting-grounds beyond the'&#xD;
grave. Upon this narrow bridge must they cross," he&#xD;
added, holding his torch to the, single trunk of a tree&#xD;
spanning the terrible chasm; "and they who -have of-&#xD;
fended the Great-Spirit-the coward, the traitor to his&#xD;

and beasts of prey. The great chief of the Shawanee is&#xD;
ready to pass over; will his white brother goowith him?"&#xD;
Montlack exhibited an evident reluctance about at-&#xD;
tempting the dangerous passage pointed out by the chief,&#xD;
and was on the eve of declining the offer of the savage,&#xD;
when the Indian, noticing his terror, exclaimed in an an-&#xD;

He has called him a squaw, and spoken angrily to him,,&#xD;
before the young warriors. My red- brother did wrong,&#xD;
for his white brother is no squaw, and is a friend to the&#xD;
red man. He has followed the Great Chief through all&#xD;
the dark paths of the Big Lodge, and is ready4to go with&#xD;
him over the gld6my pit."&#xD;
"The Great Cief was wrong," said the savage, quickly,&#xD;
i face clearing'up, and extending his brawny hand. to&#xD;
Montlack. "'Come!" he added, in a proud and confident&#xD;
tone, stepping fearlessly upon the narrow bridge-"Come!"&#xD;
The Great Spirit will protect the good and brave. The&#xD;
coward and traitor had better die 1"&#xD;
Passing quickly and securely over the dizzy and terri-&#xD;
ble abyss, the chief was immediately followed by Mont-&#xD;
lack, Gityand the remainder of the band ; but as the&#xD;
last *-rior, who had lingered behind, peiiihs with con-&#xD;
scious guilt, and whose-heart had failed him, stepped upon&#xD;
that narrow bridge, he was seen to totter and waver, and&#xD;
scarcely had he passed over one half of the dangerous&#xD;
way before he halted, irresolutely saying to and fro, as&#xD;
a man upon wire, and then, with a shrill and unearthly&#xD;
yell, he fell headlong, pinging' into the gloomy pit be-&#xD;
low, but still- grasping tightly in his hand his flaming&#xD;
torch, and'passing thus, as the flash of a meteor, from the&#xD;
eyes of his comnpanions forever.&#xD;
Montlack trembled with horror, and cold drops of per-&#xD;
spiration gathered upoi his pale brow, as he witnessed&#xD;
this unexpected and terrible death of the unfortunate&#xD;
savage;but the companions of the dead warrior beheld&#xD;
his' horrible fa1l with' the stoic indifference of their Grace,&#xD;
the .chief c, y remarking, as he turned to move away-&#xD;
"The ,eat Spirit knows all things'; his eye never&#xD;
sleepethOar brother was a coward and traitor, and he&#xD;
  has gono the dark land of the bad spirits; the young&#xD;
&#xD;
squaws of the Shawanee will not mourn his fate; the owl&#xD;
and raven will sing his death song.&#xD;
Leaving the' pit, their way led through an avenue of&#xD;
surpassing beauty, and one of wonderful extent, being&#xD;
more than sixty feet wide, and two miles in .length.&#xD;
But the heart of'Montlack was in the dark pit behind him,&#xD;
and he could not enjoy the beauty of the rooms through&#xD;
which he now passed. He had seen the flaming torch of&#xD;
the unfortunate warrior vanish in murky darkness, and&#xD;
the.wild scream. of the doomed Indian was still ringing&#xD;
in his ears. He could not-feel or assume the indifference&#xD;
of the savages ; and, in spite of every effort to the contrary,&#xD;
the awful scene he had witnessed was ever recurring; to&#xD;
his memory, and covering with a mourning veil the won-&#xD;
derful magnificence and fairy beauty of this portion of the&#xD;
cavern. He, however, passed along, intuitively following&#xD;
the footsteps of his conductor; but his eye caught not the&#xD;
smooth floor-of pure, white-crusted snow, upon which has&#xD;
was walking, and lingered only with stupid indifference&#xD;
upon its gorgeous ceilings of curled and glittering stalac-&#xD;
tites. It was only after traversing this long avenue, and&#xD;
descending'*narrow winding way to the bank of a broad&#xD;
darkriver, that his wandering thoughts were again brought&#xD;
back to the reality of the scene around him, and the stupor&#xD;
which had gathered over him was. dispelled '; and not&#xD;
then, until the hand of the chief was laid upon his shoulder,&#xD;
and in a deep, earnest tone he exclaimed&#xD;
"My white brother has reached the end of his journey..&#xD;
Before him lies the dark waters over which none but the&#xD;
spirits of the dead an pass. Beyond it are the happy&#xD;
hunting-grounds of the re; man. The drreat Chief of the&#xD;

He has shown him the tomb of the Great Prophetess, and&#xD;
led him along through the winding paths of the Big Lodge&#xD;
to see its wonders. Is he satisfied, or would he hear&#xD;
more? The ear of his red brother is still open.&#xD;
"The Great Chief has not spoken with a lying tongue!f"&#xD;

and emphatic style of the savage; " his white brother has&#xD;

He knows his red brother has spoken nothing but the&#xD;

But before gatraemng his steps, the chief arranged his&#xD;

this done, gave a loud, long, and peculiar yell. A moment&#xD;
after, and three or more clear and ringingyells came echo'.&#xD;

" The happy spirits, beyond the dark waters, have heard&#xD;
the voice of their Shawanee brother 1" said the chief, ex-&#xD;
ultingly ; "my white brother's ear. is gnot of stone. He&#xD;
heard te shout of the dead warriors greeting their&#xD;
brothel&#xD;
" Why cannot the Great Chief paddle his canoe across&#xD;
this dark river, and behold the' face of his friends ?" said&#xD;
Montlack, inquiringly.&#xD;
"My white brother speaks with the tongue df silly&#xD;
child !" said the' chief; "the Great Spirit has forbidden&#xD;
his children ; and the arm of him that would cross these&#xD;
waters would wither like the tall gras of the prairie&#xD;

" But the spirits- of the wicked," said Montlack, inte-&#xD;
rested in the wild legend of the savage ; " do they all fall&#xD;
into that horrible pit?"&#xD;
"'Not all !"' replied the chief;- " only the coward and&#xD;

Montlack,' as if satisfied with this wild legend of the&#xD;
savage, accounting for the mysterious river, the eyeless&#xD;
fishes, and the bats, made no farther inquiry ; and the&#xD;
chief, after another loud yell, in which he was joined by&#xD;
all of his warriors, and which, to their seeming great de-.&#xD;
light, was returned across the shadowy waters with deafen-.&#xD;

duty (llotted them,; and had now for some time been anxi-&#xD;
ously awaiting the presence of their leader, anxious on&#xD;
account of their fears for his safety; for they regarded the&#xD;
dark raysteries of the cave with dread and awe ; and still&#xD;
more anxious on account of their great, desire to glut their&#xD;
savage tastes for cruelty, upon the person of their pale-&#xD;
faced prisoner.&#xD;
The Shawanee chieftainreceived this boisterous welcome&#xD;
of his followers in dignified silence-; and his face, when he&#xD;
resumed his place by the fire, expressed neither pleasure&#xD;
nor dissatisfaction; but was as calm, and indifferent, and&#xD;
unruffled as if nothing had occurred, and he had not been&#xD;
absent...&#xD;
Not so, however, was it with those who had accompanied&#xD;
him;-for while their chief, reclining upon his buffalo robe,&#xD;
calmly and silently smoked his pipe, they on their part&#xD;
were busily engaged in satisfying the eager curiosity of&#xD;
their friends. The low hum of their deep guttural voices&#xD;
fIlled the apartment, and gave it an air or appearance of&#xD;
life and bustle, not at all in unison with the wild and&#xD;
magnificent scenery of the cavern, and somewhat destroy-&#xD;
ing the effect-of its gloom, and loneliness, and grandeur.&#xD;
Seizing this moment, when the savages all seemed either&#xD;
intent upon taking a short:period of rest, after the fatigues&#xD;
of their journey, or in gratifying their curiosity, or in giv-&#xD;
ing vent to their long-restrained loquaciousness, Montlack&#xD;
gazed eagerly around, wishing to make a hurried survey&#xD;
of the changes that had taken place in the chamber during&#xD;
his absence. He had gathered, from the movements of the&#xD;
savages themselves, and from a hint given him by Girty,&#xD;
that it was their intention to put a prisoner to the torture;&#xD;
a now, as his eye wandered over the' apartment, catching&#xD;
its  r    post firmly planted in the sandy floor of&#xD;
'he caynd around it numerous heaps.of dry fagots,&#xD;
his fears&amp;amp;ad suspicions were fully confirmed. These pre-&#xD;
parationdua all been made during his absence, and Mont-&#xD;
lack, although ignorant, so far as personal knowledge went,&#xD;
of the barbarous punishment of the stake, could not help&#xD;
shuddering When he beheld these ogninous signs of their&#xD;
savage purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
He was selfish and cruel himself, when his own hatred&#xD;
or interest was in any way concerned, but now that one&#xD;
of his own race, and a stranger to him, was about tpla-i&#xD;
a victim to the hellish malice and cruelty'of t~iesvages,&#xD;
he could not think of'it but with a thrill oflhorror and&#xD;
repugnance, and with a secret hope that he might be mis-&#xD;
taken, or that the wild beings around him would delay&#xD;
the dreaded moment of execution.'-&#xD;
But he was not left long in doubt ; for the chief, as if&#xD;
satisfied with the short repose he had taken, arose from&#xD;
his recumbent position by the fire, and, moving a few&#xD;
paces, stood a moment contemplating the preparations&#xD;
made for the sacrifice; then, turning to his warriors with&#xD;
a gleam of savage satisfaction playing upon his swarthy&#xD;
countenance, said:&#xD;
"My young braves have obeyed the command of their&#xD;
chief; he is satisfied; let them bring forward the pale-&#xD;
faced prisoner !"&#xD;
With a yell of delight, several of the warriors hastened&#xD;
to a distant part of the same chamber, and soon returned&#xD;
leading in their midst a stout young borderer, securely&#xD;
bound.&#xD;
The prisoner wore no marks of fear upon his stern and&#xD;
swarthy face, but as heapproached, glanced with an eagle&#xD;
eye around upon his captors, as. if measuring their&#xD;
force, or running over in his mind the chances of escape.&#xD;
Though apparently in the prime of manhood, and from&#xD;
his look and person not over thirty years of age, the&#xD;
prisoner was an old Indian hunter, and esteemed as one&#xD;
of the bravest and most daring scouts of the country. He&#xD;
was well acquainted with all the wiles and cruelties of the&#xD;
savage, and had, in his time, caused many of their best&#xD;
warriors to bite the dust. He had tracked them on many&#xD;
of their war-paths; had followed them even to their own&#xD;
wigwams; and wore about his person (in the Indianw&#xD;
style), when taken captive, many of the bloody trophies&#xD;
of his bravery. His countenance, as we have already re-&#xD;
marked, bore no traces of fear, for he seemed entirely&#xD;
ignorant of the pressing danger of his situation; or, if not&#xD;

ignorant, careless and' indifferent as to his fate. But no&#xD;
sooner had his searching eye caught a glimpse of the&#xD;
ominous post, with its attendant-fagots, than he was fully&#xD;
aware of the terrible doom that awaited him, for he had&#xD;
once before .been a prisoner to the savages,,.had run the&#xD;
dreaded gauntey: and had been even tied to the stake.&#xD;
A slight pallor may have gathered -over his bronzed and&#xD;
weather-beaten countenance, as he caught- sight of the&#xD;
fagot, and torch, and stake, made ready for his own tor-&#xD;
ture and death; but if so, it was not witnessed by his&#xD;
savage captors, and was gone in a moment. "ie had ac-&#xD;
quired much of the stoic. indifference of the savage to&#xD;
pain nd death by his dangerous and hazardous life, and&#xD;
now that he was fully satisfied as to his doom, determined&#xD;
in.his own mind to meet it as a soldier, and give his ene-&#xD;
mies no cause-for exultation. His was an Herculean, though&#xD;
ot graceful person; but, clothed as it was in the flowing&#xD;
hunting-shirt and moccason of the borderer, would strike&#xD;
the eye of the most careless, and no even elicited a mur-&#xD;
mnur of admiration from his ruthless) enemies. Drawing&#xD;
near to their chief, the savages surrounding the prisoner&#xD;
gave way,leaving the triumphant Shawanee and the bold&#xD;
young borderer face to face, and only a few paces apart.&#xD;
For a moment the savage chieftain and semi-savage&#xD;
scout stood eyeing each other, as if measuring the power&#xD;
and force of the muscles so bountifully developed in the&#xD;
=person of :either. The Indian, wrapped in hisflowing&#xD;
banket, with his otherwise handsome face disigured and&#xD;
msade hideous with paint,presented a splendid specimen&#xD;
of the pure..savage; while the borderer, in his hunting-&#xD;

the undaufited bearing of his prisoner.&#xD;
"Faith," replied Pat Connelly (for such was the name&#xD;

"-the chief must have an eagle eye to make this diskivery.&#xD;

wern't a woman, _in man's toggery. Two of them fell&#xD;

lock about my person. A squaw, indeed!1 the praist and&#xD;
my mither didn't think so, for they called me Pat, and I&#xD;
guess Pat is-a man's name 'alLthe world over.&#xD;
"The young brave of- the pale face is not wise," said&#xD;
the chief; a flash of anger-mantling over his countenance&#xD;
as Connelly reminded him of the loss of his-warriors;&#xD;
"'His silly boasting, like the' drum of .the pheasant when&#xD;
.the hunter is near, will only bring death to himself."&#xD;
"I have scalped many a red divil," replied the borderer,&#xD;
"aid many a warrior starting forth on his-war-pathg is&#xD;
niver returned to his wigwam, for he fell beneath  y&#xD;
bullet, and became food for the wolf and buzzard. They&#xD;
have me now in their power; the stake has been made&#xD;

"Ugh !" muttered the chief, "the pale -fac has a quick&#xD;

"did not close their hands upon the silly buffalo, until he&#xD;

Ahowl of fury met these taunts of their prisoner, and&#xD;
the chief, goaded to madness, seemed about to gratify the&#xD;

"And why should he?" replied the scout; "'Pat Connelly&#xD;

nance of the renegade, than a flash Qf fury gleamed out&#xD;
from his hitherto careless face, And to the proposition of&#xD;
the Indian, he replied in a stern and scornful voice-&#xD;
"Pat Connelly does not brother with the redskins. He&#xD;
is no traitor nor black-hearted murderous villain, like that&#xD;
base dog, Simon Girty! - He would rather be roasted&#xD;
piecemeal than betray women and children to perish&#xD;

Great Chief and his warriors are contending for their&#xD;
hunting.grounds, and by my faith, Pat Connelly will be&#xD;
the last man to blame them for taking the scalp of his&#xD;
own mother's son, for 'tis a fair fight, all accordin' to&#xD;
natur', and they don't know any better; but, when a&#xD;
feller is too great a villain to live among his own people,&#xD;
like Simon Girty there, for I know the murdering' knave,&#xD;
and joins with the redskins agin' his own race, he becomes&#xD;
a dispised and hated renegade, and no honest man will&#xD;
ever touch his bloody hand .IPat Connelly,if he ain't jist&#xD;
ready sfor the next world, is ready to die rather than aid&#xD;
that scoundrel, Girty, in any of his treacherous schemes "&#xD;
"We'll see," exclaimed the renegade in a harsh and&#xD;
angry voice. "The first touch of the torch will change&#xD;
your braggart tongue to one of supplication; and you&#xD;
will yet bow your knee with cries for mercy, to that same&#xD;
villain and renegade, SimonGirty !"&#xD;
"By my faith!" said the scout, tauntingly, "the white-&#xD;

his-God; and a little toastid' by the bloody savages can&#xD;

Stung deeply by the taunts of Connelly, the renegade&#xD;
laid his hand quickly upon the handle of his tomahawk,&#xD;
but withdrawing it as quickly, muttered in an undertone-&#xD;
"No, no! that is what he wants! ,I will leave him to&#xD;
die at-the stake!"..&#xD;
At a sign from their chief, the Indians, impatient to&#xD;
begin their nfernal orgy, seized upon Connelly,, and&#xD;
stripping hin, bound him to the stake, securing his hands&#xD;
&#xD;
behind his back, and then with a stout cord to the post,&#xD;
but leaving his feet unfettered!&#xD;
"Well, Pat, my boy," said the Irishman, when he found&#xD;
himself in this helpless condition, speaking in a half rue!&#xD;
ful and half comic voice, as if to -gain his own consent&#xD;
to the dreadful death about to be inflicted upon him;&#xD;
"sure you never draped when you left the bogs of old&#xD;

hathen? But niver mind, boy, the red, divils will hold&#xD;
a most illegant wake over your body, and it won't be&#xD;
your fault if there ain't a St. Pat Connelly! They will&#xD;
be after looking for you at the station, but Pat Connelly has&#xD;
taken his last scout, and will niver agin' pass around the&#xD;
bottle, and sing of the dear little Kathleen he left behind&#xD;
him ovet the waters! He will niver more wander through&#xD;
the green forest and listen to the little birds, or track the&#xD;
fleeing deer, or follow the trail of the prowling redskin!&#xD;
You have fallen into the hands of the inemy, my boy,&#xD;
and divil a chance of escape can Pat Connelly see! But&#xD;
here goes for the honor of old Ireland," he added, hokl.&#xD;
ing his head erect, and looking with undaunted front&#xD;
upon his foes, "if the son of my mither can't live, he&#xD;
knows how to die, and it shall niver be said that Pat&#xD;
Connelly showed the white feather to a thieving Shawa-&#xD;
nee!"&#xD;
His mind thus reconciled to his fate, the borderer, with&#xD;
a bold and reckless look, awaited in silence the attack of&#xD;
his ruthless foes.&#xD;
I-loping to intimidate, or, like the cat, wishing to play&#xD;
for awhile with the fear or rather helplessness of their&#xD;
victim, the savages by turn hurled with skilful hands&#xD;
their tomahawks at th e    of the captive, not wishing&#xD;
to strike or destroy, bu .merely desirous to play .witb, or&#xD;
tantalize him in his agony, and perhaps force him, for&#xD;
this was their chief design, to exhibit-some token of ter-&#xD;
ror. But their endeavors to terrify Connelly were fruit-&#xD;
less, for he stood like a statue of marble; and though&#xD;
tomahawk after tomahawk whizzed clos6;by his head,&#xD;
until there was a glittering circlet of gleaming steel trenv.&#xD;

bling in the wood around him, yet never for a moment&#xD;
did his heart sink, or his eye quiver, and he continued.&#xD;
ever the same-undaunted, unmoved, and unflinching!&#xD;
Finding this measure 'unavailing, and the mind of their&#xD;
prisoner still stoically indifferent, the savages with screams&#xD;
and yells of hellish glee, next applied their burning&#xD;
torches to the naked person of the brave Irishman, all&#xD;
the time dancing around the stake, yelling and tossing&#xD;
about their flaming brands, like "'so many infuriated de-&#xD;
mons! The white flesh of poor Connelly hissed beneath&#xD;
the burning coal, and his broad chest soon became dotted&#xD;
like the body of a leper, but still he bore the torture with&#xD;
unshrinking fortitude, meeting their howls;gand yells, and&#xD;
taunts w'itt steady eye-of defiance, or mocking them, in&#xD;
the Indian style, as children and squaws; ever and anon&#xD;
pouring forth a torrent of scornful invective upon the&#xD;
head of the scowling renegade !&#xD;
Approaching the stake, one of the savages, stooping.&#xD;
down, began to blow into a blaze the dry wood placed in&#xD;
a circle around the feet of the-victim; but Connelly, no-&#xD;
ticing his design, gave him a sudden and tremendous&#xD;
kick, which sent him rolling to the very feet of his laugh-&#xD;
ing companions ! Springing quickly up, the Indian,&#xD;
with a loud yell of rage, hurled his tomahawk at the head&#xD;
of the Irishman, laying open his cheek. with a broad and&#xD;
ghastly wound !' Not content with thus revenging the&#xD;
insult he had received, the same warrior, with devilish&#xD;
malignity, gathered up a paddle of bright and living&#xD;
coals, and deliberately poured them over the head and&#xD;
shoulders of his unconquered foe! But Connelly met&#xD;
this rain of fire with a laugh of scornful defiance; and&#xD;
though the hissing coals rested on his head and shoul-&#xD;
ders, and, rolling down behind mered away upon his&#xD;
fettered hands; he bore;4he t  ents he suffered with&#xD;
iron. firmness, banterglasking his tormentor if he had&#xD;
any more such refreshing showers?&#xD;
This steadinest of the borderer, under the fiendish&#xD;
attack of the vengeful warrior, was unexpectedly the&#xD;
cause of hipliberation ; for one of the large live coals&#xD;
dropping from hi shoulders, rested upon his hands, and&#xD;
&#xD;
although giving him exquisite pain for the moment, it at&#xD;
the same-time burned through the thong with which he&#xD;
was bound, and the bold scout instantly felt and knew&#xD;
that he was free.  Summoning up all of his remaining&#xD;
strength, Connelly, with a shout so loud that it drowned&#xD;
even the clamorous yells of his enemies, seized upon one&#xD;
of the tomahawks,.still quivering in the post, and with&#xD;
one bound was in the' midst of his foes. ,Before they&#xD;
had recovered. from tieir astonishment, the gleaming&#xD;
hatchet of the borderer was. red with the life-blood of two&#xD;
of his tormentors, and dashing ,the others, as if children,&#xD;
from his path, Connelly, with ar shout of defiance, darted&#xD;
away, and was lost in the darkness of the cavern.&#xD;
With a yell of baffled fury, the Indians started in pur-&#xD;
suit, but their captive was lost in the gloom of the lofty&#xD;
avenue leading forth to'sunshine and safety; and though&#xD;
Girty, with rankling and calculating hatred, hurried&#xD;
eagerly to the entrance of the cave, and posted there a&#xD;
band of watchful warriors, the fleeing victim never made&#xD;
his appearance; and their search within the cavern, al-&#xD;
though made with care and diligence, and by torchlight,&#xD;
was met with the like bad success.&#xD;
Pat Connelly'had taken his revenge ; and the huge per-&#xD;
son of the borderer, brandishing his bloody tomahawk,&#xD;
once lost in the gloom of that mysterious cavern, was&#xD;
never again seen by his furious and baffled enemies.&#xD;
He was gone; but where to, none could say. Whether&#xD;
alive, andhid or lost in the winding paths of that'gloomy&#xD;
vault; or whether, in. he moment of victory, he had pe-&#xD;
rished by falling into ome dark pit, was alike a mystery.&#xD;
Hoping the latter, Girty and his fierce allies, sullen and&#xD;
discomfited; returned fm their unsuccessful pursuit only&#xD;
to find the stake with *'iV. victim, and near it the bloody&#xD;
bodies of the two wariors who had fallen beneath the&#xD;
tomahawk of the pale face.&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER 'VII.&#xD;
WE shift the scene. From the gloomy portals of the&#xD;
great world's wonder, the cave, we once more look out&#xD;
upon the heavens and the blessed'light of day.&#xD;
It was a bright October morning, cool, hazy, and still--&#xD;
what we call in the West, Indian Summer-and the, clear.-&#xD;
ing-or opening of Bryan and Duffe, like an island upon&#xD;
the bosom of the broad sea, stood forth prominent and&#xD;
cheering, in the encircling embrace of the dark, bound-&#xD;
less forest. It was the first-step towards civilization, that&#xD;
lovely and diminutive settlement, with its rough, unart-&#xD;
istic dwelling; but since that period, the tread of civil-&#xD;
ization and refinement has been like the fabled work of .&#xD;
the genii; and towns, villages, and country villas have&#xD;
sprung up from the-damp shades of the forest, as rapidly,&#xD;
and almost as magically as the fairy palaces we read of&#xD;
in Arabian romance.&#xD;
But at the period of which we are speaking, the dwell-&#xD;
ings of our race were very rare in Kentucky, and the&#xD;
station of our hero called a settlement some ten miles&#xD;
distant its' nearest neighbor. As we have already said,&#xD;
it was a bright October morning, with the early sun cast-&#xD;
ing a mellow and shadowy light through the hazy atmo-&#xD;
sphere; and there were no sounds abroad to disturb the&#xD;
death-like stillness of the scene about this pioneer settle-&#xD;
ment other than the soft song-of the wild bird, and gay,&#xD;
merry bark of the frolicksome squirrel. The bullet of&#xD;
the hunter had not yet been duarned against such small&#xD;
game, and the -birds and squirrels gathering from their&#xD;
homes in the forest, looked down inquisitively, and al-&#xD;
most without fear, upon the comings and goings of the&#xD;
early settler, thinking much, no doubt, in their quiet&#xD;
way, and greatly puzzled to know the design and intent&#xD;
of these strange intruders upon their hitherto undisputed&#xD;
territory.&#xD;
&#xD;
To the eye of the unwary and careless observer, there&#xD;
was nothing wrong or unusual in or about the station&#xD;
upon this particular morning; but had the gaze of 'theee&#xD;
ever cautious and watchful Sharp-Eye been turned, a4 the '&#xD;
moment of which we are speaking, upon' the f4$jst,&#xD;
beyond the pickets, he might have discovered sois&#xD;
ground for uneasiness in the quick and anxious cries o4&#xD;
the catbird, flying about as if alarmed by the presence&#xD;
of some unexpected foe, and more than probable the&#xD;
unusual excitement and evident terror of the little song-&#xD;
ster would have aroused in the suspicious bosom of the&#xD;
wily borderer some thoughts of a lurking savage, or at&#xD;
least a prowling bear. But Sharp-Eye.was not there;&#xD;
nor was Bryan or the Sergeant, for they had both obeyed,&#xD;
the summons of the Scout, and had gone forth upon the&#xD;
trail, of their bloody and ruthless foe. They feared no&#xD;
attack upon the station during their absence-  for, the&#xD;
savages were far away, and the hardy borderers, for&#xD;
twenty miles around, alarmed by the information of&#xD;
Kenton, were gathering, not to await the coming of their&#xD;
enemy, but to seek them, and hunt them out, from their&#xD;
dark lurking-place, where they had been discovered by&#xD;
the Scout.&#xD;
Coma and her child, and Sally, guarded by the faithful&#xD;
Titus, were now the only inmates of the station, and, with&#xD;
the first peep of the sun, the honest black might have&#xD;
been seen 'creeping lazily from his couch of buffalo skins,&#xD;
and strolling listlessly about the yard within the pickets;&#xD;
then came forth the bustling wife of Duffe, busy with&#xD;
some household duty; and Titus, at her commands, lost&#xD;
his apparent listlessness;~hurrying, with maneringing&#xD;
blows of the sounding axe, to prepare the usual morning&#xD;
fire. Presently, Coma's bright face peeped out from her&#xD;
comfortable lodge, and Sally's broad countenance beamed&#xD;
a pleasant good-morning; while Titus, staying his uplifted&#xD;
axe, grinned a heartfelt welcome. Then bounded forward,&#xD;
with a; bleat of joyous recognition, a, graceful spotted&#xD;
fawn to receive the caresses of its mistress; and Coma,&#xD;
nothing loth, folded the timid, but loving animal in her&#xD;
arms, and with rany soft and-endearing words wou&#xD;

fin.. console it for the loss of mother, and liberty, and the&#xD;
green forest. -Nor did she forget her cackling brood, for&#xD;
they were the pride of her innocent heart, and her own&#xD;
peculiar property. Fowls were very',scarce in the coun-&#xD;
try at that day, and the mother of the brood had been&#xD;
obtained at much trouble, and she had watched over the&#xD;
-&#xD;
young since they escaped from their snowy covering, and&#xD;
new with liberal hand answered their morning call by.&#xD;
scattering around a bountiful supply of crumbs.&#xD;
Turning once more to the low bleat ,of her fawn, Coma,&#xD;
as she -atted it upon the head and looked down into its&#xD;
large liquid eyes, murmured to herself, a shadow flitting - .&#xD;
across her, but a moment ago, bright and sunny counte-&#xD;
nance :&#xD;
M    poor little pet, you have a sad, sweet cry, and did&#xD;
I not fear that you would fall a victim, to the wolf or&#xD;
some rutilless hunter, I would send you forth again to&#xD;
seek your kindred in the deep shades of yonder forest.&#xD;
But do not look so mournfully and inquisitively into my&#xD;
face' she added, seating herself upon the stump ~of a&#xD;
recently 'felled tree, and lovingly folding the gentlese rea-&#xD;
txr - herrms, "for-you fill my heart with sadness,. and&#xD;
mal        m e. think, when I look into your mild and loving&#xD;
eyesa     would be the fate of my own dear little boy,&#xD;
should he ever be left, like thee, without. father and mo-&#xD;
ther, to the indifferent care of strangers. Your gentle,&#xD;
dam, my bonnie pet," she' 'continued, patting the fawn,&#xD;
and looking musingly into its eyes, "led thee lovingly&#xD;
through the quiet glades and along the sunny ills, flee-&#xD;
ing as glad and quickly to your plaintive bleat as I to'&#xD;
my darling's cry. But sheis dead now, slain by the bul-&#xD;
let of 'the reckless hunter,; and had not the kind heart of&#xD;
goodSinon been touched by your sad call, and had 'he&#xD;
not brought thee to my caressing arms, you would have'.&#xD;
long sine perished, my beautiful Nan, in loneliness -and&#xD;
want. But 'cheer s p, my dear little one; you look' so&#xD;
intelligently and 4rustingly into my face, that I. almost&#xD;
fancy thee  human and imagine I behold a gleam of gra-&#xD;
titude beaming from those dark orbs of thine. ' My gentle,&#xD;
loving Nan," she continued, mournfully, a tear dancing&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, VOW FULFILLED.&#xD;
&#xD;
in her soft eye, "shall never know want so long as I have&#xD;
an ear to hear her call, and a heart to greet her plaintive&#xD;
cry. I'll be a mother to thee, my little motherless; never&#xD;
doubt and look so earnestly, for in truth I love thee&#xD;
dearly, and will take good care of thee, and when witer,&#xD;
comes will make thee a warm bed by the fire; and&#xD;
own darling boy will feed thee with his tiny hands."&#xD;
For a few minutes after this artless monologue, Coma&#xD;
- sat in silence with her arms tjirown -arournd the neck of&#xD;
her graceful pet, looking wistfully. and sadly out on the&#xD;
distant forest, or-rather on vacancy, for this communing&#xD;
with herself had .excited a vein of melancholy reverie,&#xD;
andl her thoughts were now busy with memories of' the&#xD;
past and dreams of the future.  Her father, her absent&#xD;
husband, and her sleeping child were all trooping through&#xD;
her busy brain; ut this wild medley of bitter and sweet&#xD;
memories, crowdi}pg thus upon her musing heart, was soon&#xD;
dispelled by the uppoetic voice of Sally; and, starting from&#xD;
her, dreams, her face like an April day-half tears, half&#xD;
*sunshine-Coma,:twith a smile at her own emotion, after&#xD;
once more embracing her pet, arose from her seat' and&#xD;
returned slowly to the- house. Titus, throwing over -his&#xD;
shoulder a huge log, and whistling as he went, with ;&#xD;
and cheerful tread followed the footsteps.of his&#xD;
and Sally, now left alone in the yard, after finishing thai&#xD;
task upon which she had been so intently employe1&#xD;
'rolling carelessly to the gate with seeming indifference,&#xD;
as if her thoughts were otherwise engaged, drew back the&#xD;
bars and. threw it wide open. A loud yell greeted her&#xD;
appearance, and her air of careless indifference quickly&#xD;
gave place to one of horror and amazement;. for no sooner .&#xD;
had the gate swung back upon its.heavy creakingbinges&#xD;
than twenty savages sprung up from a little coppice not&#xD;
more than twenty paces distant, and with hideous screams,&#xD;
brandishing their tomahawks, rushed madly to the open-&#xD;
ug.'&#xD;
The good wife of the Sergeant was nqne of'your 'ethe-&#xD;

THE WINTER LODGE;&#xD;
&#xD;
no thought either of fainting or screaming, nor did she&#xD;
think of waiting the nearer approach of the savages, but&#xD;
considering' discretion the better part of valor, she turned&#xD;
quickly, and fled with all speed to the house. She was&#xD;
not a moment too soon; for, although terror lent additional&#xD;
speed to her flight, as she sprang over the sill, and hur-&#xD;
riedly attempted to close the door, afierce warrior threw&#xD;
his body half within the house, thus rendering her care-&#xD;
l and eager endeavors for safety apparently fruitless.&#xD;
But Titus now came to the rescue, and grappling with the&#xD;
struggling Indian, drew him in, leaving his mistress, who&#xD;
still maintained her post, to close and bar 'the door. She&#xD;
succeeded, and the next instant a score of whooping sav-&#xD;
ages were battering with their light hatchets against the&#xD;
heavy oak puncheons, but finding their immediate attempts&#xD;
at -forcing an entrance hopeless, and not knowing the&#xD;
weakness of the garrison, with a yell of disappointment&#xD;
they retreated hastily, beyond the pickets, to await the&#xD;
result of their first attack.&#xD;
The fierce*contest between the negro-'and Indian was&#xD;
still going on. The latter, cut off from his companions,&#xD;
anddependent upon his.own exertions for safety, brought&#xD;
into play every power of his athletic body, and struggled&#xD;
furiously to free his arms from the iron embrace of his&#xD;
sturdy opponent.. The black, ,on the other hand, was&#xD;
battling for his- own life and the lives of those equally&#xD;
dear, and who had been confidently left under his care&#xD;
and protection; and now, with all the force of hissinewy,&#xD;
arms, maintained his grasp upon the limbs of his enemy.&#xD;
Rolling over and over upon the floor, but still pinioning&#xD;
the arms of the savage, Titus called out to his mistress,&#xD;
who had by this time completed the fastenings of the&#xD;
door:-&#xD;
"Gor'a mighty, Miss Sally, dis child's bref am nearly&#xD;
gib out. Git de axe and finish dis debil while I'm got&#xD;
him."&#xD;
Without delay the brave-hearted woman hurried to do&#xD;
asiequested bythe exhausted negro ; but the savage, who&#xD;
was uppermost, and saw her design, hindered, for a mo-&#xD;
ment her purpose, by dodging his head from side to side&#xD;

so as to destroy the certainty of the blow, and endanger&#xD;
the -life'of Titus.&#xD;
"Neber fear, Miss Sally," exclaimed the black, thinking&#xD;
that she hesitated from conscientious scruples about spill-&#xD;
ing blood, "it am all right, and 'taint no sin to kill an&#xD;
Ingin. Gor'a mighty," he continued, as the Indian made&#xD;
another desperate effort to free his arms, "split open him&#xD;
dam head, or old Titus will hab to gib up."&#xD;
Her scruples overcome, if she had any, by Titus's ipse&#xD;
didt as to the propriety and innocence of shedding blood&#xD;
under the circumstances, and catching a favorable oppor-&#xD;
tunity, Sally drove the uplifted axe deep into the brain&#xD;
of the savage, and the black, throwing off the stiffening&#xD;
body of his foe, sprang to his feet, exclaiming, exult-&#xD;
ingly:-aoeofxlingeut&#xD;
-"Leti anoder of dem'bloody debils, Miss Sally, and&#xD;
old Titus will just hold him fast till you crack him war-&#xD;
nut head for him."&#xD;
But Mrs. Duffer 'who by right of being the wife of a&#xD;
military man, had constituted herself commander-in-chief&#xD;
of the besieged station, had no notion of obeying this&#xD;
warlike request of the black. But, taking advantage .of&#xD;
the momentary lull in the attack .of the savages;which&#xD;
she knew would soon be resumed at some other'point,&#xD;
'with hurried alacrity'she busied herself in making pre-&#xD;
parations for a brave defence; whilst Titus, under orders,&#xD;
grasping his ready rifle, kept watch through a loophole&#xD;
upon the movements of the enemy without, ever and anon&#xD;
casting, without orders, a grim smile of satisfaction upon&#xD;
the body of his late foe.&#xD;
Coma, at the first yell of the dreaded enemy, had sunk,&#xD;
overcome with terror; into a chair ; but when she wit-&#xD;
nessed the fierce struggle, of the faithful negro and the&#xD;
Indian, and beheld the bloody death of the latter, she&#xD;
lost all consciousness, and Mrs. DuffI, having no time to&#xD;
go to her assistance, or perhaps thinking it would be best&#xD;
to allow her to remain in that condition, with merely a&#xD;
pitying glance at her prostrate person, left her in happy&#xD;
ignorance of their dangerous situation.&#xD;
The Indians, hearing nothing from their' too eager&#xD;

&#xD;
companion, and taking his death for granted, began now&#xD;
to think of another assault. Peering cautiously over&#xD;
the top of the picket fence, they could see no appearance&#xD;
of an. enemy, and were somewhat surprised that their&#xD;
partly exposed persons had not drawn a shot from the&#xD;
besieged: Becoming emboldened by the impunity with&#xD;
which they had been allowed to make these cautious ob.&#xD;
servations, one of the warriors, more reckless or daring&#xD;
than his companions, stepped within the gate, fully'ex-&#xD;
posing his entire person. But old Titus had not been&#xD;
asleep; and although he 'kept an eye on his late opponent.&#xD;
lying on the floor within, he kept the other fastened on&#xD;
his foe without. He had seen the heads of the savage&#xD;
cautiously peering over the fence, but merely grinned a&#xD;
defiance, holding his bullet for a more certain opportu-&#xD;
nity. The reckless. hardihood of the savage, standing&#xD;
fully exposed within the pickets, presented him with the&#xD;
opportunity he sought ; and, taking advantage of the te-&#xD;
merity of his foe, the black, with deliberate aim, sent&#xD;
a bullet through his heart, excqijming, with 'a chuckle of&#xD;
satisfaction, as theIndian bounded high into the air, fall-&#xD;
ing lifeless to the'earth:- .&#xD;
"Dar, dam you ! take dat to 'member Titus, de black&#xD;
white man."&#xD;
The; Indians, with a yell of rage at the death of their&#xD;
companion, answered the shot and bravado of the black&#xD;
with a harmless volley of bullets; and finding that use-&#xD;
less exposure of the person was attended with danger,&#xD;
withdrew from harm's way, by dropping back behind the&#xD;
fence.&#xD;
Girty, under a private arrangement between himself&#xD;
and Montlack, was the leader of this party of the In-&#xD;
dians.; the chief, with the remainder of the band, taking&#xD;
along with him Montlack, having hurried on to another&#xD;
settlement ; and now, While Titus was congratulating&#xD;
himself upon the stwcess of his shot, and the second dis-&#xD;
cdnfiture of the foe, the renegade, having skirted the in-&#xD;
closure, was preparing to enter from that side immediately&#xD;
contiguous to;the room usually occupied by Bryan. He&#xD;
had noticed that the' firing came from the other room of&#xD;
&#xD;
the cabin, and shrewdly guessed that the apartment he was&#xD;
now approaching with some half score of his followers, was&#xD;
unoccupied, and hoped that, once able to make a lodge-&#xD;
ment there, he could terrify the inmates of the other (by&#xD;
threats of firing the house) into surrendering. But he&#xD;
was mistaken in his calculation:;'for the room he was now&#xD;
stealthily approaching; although still and silent, and ap-&#xD;
parently tenantless, was nevertheless occupied; but not&#xD;
by Bryan, ready to die for his family, nor'by the gallant&#xD;
Scout, snuffing the battle afar off; nor yet by the calm&#xD;
and sturdy Sergeant, or indeed by any dangerous foe.&#xD;
The sleeping boy of Coma, forgotten in her first fright,&#xD;
and not yet remembered; on account of her' subsequent&#xD;
insensibility, was the only tenant of the .deserted apart-&#xD;
ment, and was still slumbering in innocent unconscious.&#xD;
ness of danger, while the gleaming tomahawk of the&#xD;
bloody savage was ready to make his quiet sleep the&#xD;
slumber of eternity.&#xD;
"De red debils," exclaimed Titus, with a well-pleased&#xD;
grin at his mistress, "won't get dis child's scalp. ' Dey&#xD;
done, gib him up, and ar' making tracks to some place&#xD;
whar darkeys am scarce, and scalps to be got for de&#xD;
axing. Dis darkey ain't one ob dem sort ; he neber gib&#xD;

Hi! hi! I gib dat fellar partikier goss, and dis child&#xD;
wouldn't wonder if dey didn't try dat dar 'speriment&#xD;

While the black; looking from his loophole, was thus&#xD;
buoying up 'his heart with thoughts of victory,- Mrs.&#xD;
Duffe, scarce hearing what he said, was kneeling by the&#xD;
side of Coma, using the common remedies in such cases,&#xD;
to arouse her once more to sensibility.&#xD;
"Are those horrible Indians gone-? and my precious&#xD;
boy, is he safe?" murmured Coma, slowly reviving, her&#xD;
mind still flighty, and not yet entirely conscious of the&#xD;
absence of her child.&#xD;
"Oh, my God !" exclaimed Madm Duffe, now for the&#xD;
first time remembering the exposed and hazardous situa-&#xD;
tion of the boy, "the child is in the other room!"&#xD;

hole, '"'little Massa Bryan not be here ?"&#xD;
"Oh !" exclaimed Coma, springing to her feet, and&#xD;
staring with a look of stupid terror into the face of her&#xD;
horrified friend, " have they murdered my beautiful boy?"&#xD;
"No ! no!' replied Duffe's wife, as. calmly as her own&#xD;
tortured feelings would allow, and trembling at the terri-&#xD;
ble .agony she saw painted upon the face of the yet'un-&#xD;
coniscious mother; "little Mister Bryan is only in the&#xD;
other room; I'll go and bring him to you."&#xD;
"Thanks! thanks !" murmured Coma, sinking back&#xD;
into her chair, and pressing her confused brow with her&#xD;
clasped hands.&#xD;
"Dis old niggar will go!" said Titus addressing Mrs.&#xD;
Duffe, "him no 'count, nohow; him's chunk be nearly&#xD;
burnt out; let de debils take him's scalp."&#xD;
But the kind-hearted Sally, telling Titus he was their&#xD;
only defender, and if he was killed all would be lost,&#xD;
turned away from the sorrowing mother and muttering&#xD;
black, with the full determination. of attempting the dan-&#xD;
gerous exploit of going for the sleeping child. But when&#xD;
she -neared the door, and when her hand was raised to&#xD;
remove -the fastenings, it was suddenly stayed and her&#xD;
heart chilled, by hearing in the passage though which&#xD;
she would have to pass, the confused and rapid tread of&#xD;
the dreaded enemy. It was Girty and his band, and they&#xD;
had gained, unnoticed by the litee garrison, the apart-&#xD;
ment of Coma. Halting, with her hand still 'upi4fted,&#xD;
poor Sally cast a look of agony upon the pa] gn-&#xD;
tenance of the bereaved mother; then came distetly&#xD;
to her ears the murmur of the astonished .savages, at the&#xD;
wild and barbarous luxury of the room into which they&#xD;
had entered, followed quickly .y a triumphant yell, ac-&#xD;
companied by the shrill and startled cry of the child.&#xD;
Coma's languor and faintness were gone in a moment.&#xD;
She had heard the cry of her terrified boy; and, with a&#xD;
wild scream of agony, springing to her feet, she threw&#xD;
back the simple fastenings of the door, and darted madly&#xD;
into. the very nidst of the savages.&#xD;
"De debils can hab my wool," said Titus, rubbing his&#xD;
&#xD;
-           OR, VOW FULFILLED.              89&#xD;
head with his hand, and looking sorrowfully after his&#xD;
young mistress, "dar's no use fightin' now."&#xD;
A fierce warrior stood with uplifted hatchet over the&#xD;
cradle of little B1'yan; but the half-crazed mother, regard-&#xD;
less of all danger, and thinking only of her child, threw&#xD;
her person devotedly over the body of heiboy, looking&#xD;
up beseechingly into the hideous and distorted counte-&#xD;
nance of the Indian ; and he, though a savage, ruthless&#xD;
and cruel by education and-nature, as if touched with pity&#xD;
or admiration at the devotion and bravery of the mother,&#xD;
with a muttered-,exclamation of surprise, restrained the&#xD;
falling blow, and they were saved.&#xD;
Girty's instructions from Montlack were to save Coma&#xD;
harmless, but to carry her away into captivity; and now&#xD;
that the savage had spared the child-villain though he&#xD;
was, and cruel and bloodthirsty-he had not the heart to&#xD;
destroy or take it from her arms. Madam Duffe and&#xD;
Titus, after the capture of Coma ,and her child, had&#xD;
no desire to prolong the contest, and so surrendering at&#xD;
discretion, they were all hurried away prisoners together.&#xD;
A few moments later, and the. station, late so joyous&#xD;
and happy, a   eaceful, was stripped of its most valua-&#xD;
ble contents,  d left tenantless and deserted. The two&#xD;
dead warriors-the victims of Titus's prowess-were left&#xD;
just where they had fallen, for the Indians were in too&#xD;
great a hurry either to bury or conceal their bodies.&#xD;
CHAPTER        VIII.&#xD;
"WE 'vE jist had our tramp for nothin'; for the tarnal&#xD;
redskins have gi'n us the slip as sure as shootin'."&#xD;
It was the day following the departure of the Indians&#xD;
from the cave, that Kenton made this exclamation, as he&#xD;
stood looking'down upon the vine-embowered little bay&#xD;
where, but a few days previous, he had seen the flotilla of&#xD;
the savages so snugly moored, but which was now empty,&#xD;

and without a trace of canoe, or boat of any descrip-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"From what do you draw this conclusion ?" said Bry.&#xD;
an,, springing-to his side.&#xD;
"Nothing easier, Mr. Bryan," replied the Scout; "it ar'&#xD;
as-plain as aG#buffalo trail to a'salt lick ;" and after hurry.-&#xD;
ing down to the water's edge, followed by Bryan and&#xD;
some six or more tall borderers, he continued-" thar&#xD;
canoes are all gone to a sartainty, and here you see," he&#xD;
added, pointing to many fresh moccason tracks in the&#xD;
soft sand, "is a broad trace of thar-retreat; and not long&#xD;
made, either; for blast my buttons if twelve hours have&#xD;
passed since an Ingen heel made that ar' trail."&#xD;
"But the canoes may have been taken by a portion of&#xD;
the savages, to go on some expedition," remarked a young&#xD;
hunter, "and the remainder may yet be in the cave."&#xD;
".Or they may have been removed to some other point,"&#xD;
suggested the Sergeant.&#xD;
"At any rate, we had better examine the neighbor-&#xD;
hood before we determine," said- another.&#xD;
"It's no use," replied Simon, in a positive tone; "I'll&#xD;
jist bet my new huntin'-shirt agin, the o14gst blanket in&#xD;
company, thar ain't a redskin in a day's scout.  Did&#xD;
you ever know an Ingen," he added, as proof positive&#xD;
of his opinion, "fond of work? It. ar' agin thar na-&#xD;
tur' to do anything of the kind.".&#xD;
"I can't see how their repugnance to labor," remarked&#xD;
Bryan, somewhat impatiently, "'proves that the canoes&#xD;
have not been removed by a portion of the band, or that&#xD;
some of the savages may not still be in the neighbor-&#xD;
hood."&#xD;
" Jist the way with you youngsters," retorted Kenton,&#xD;
"who ain't up to the ways of the redskins.. But do you&#xD;
think, Mister Bryan, that if only a part of them lazy&#xD;
devils had gone on a-scout, they'd have troubled them-&#xD;
selves with all the canoes, and left none for thar friends&#xD;
in a case of emergency? No, no," he continued, shaking&#xD;
his head, "they' are all gone clear enough ; but I won't&#xD;
pretend to say they all went in the canoes, but I'm sar-&#xD;
tainof this much-that them what did go in the boats&#xD;
&#xD;
didn't 'spect to return, and didn't leave an Ingen be-&#xD;
hind."&#xD;
"You may be right, Simon," said Head; "but although&#xD;
they have given us the slip, they may yet fall into the&#xD;
hands of our friends at the Vienna station."&#xD;
"'Zactly, Mister Bryan," said Simon, " but'then we've&#xD;
missed all the fun. Cuss. that stubborn, mule-headed&#xD;
Jack Malden," he added, with increased heat, becoming&#xD;
more enraged the more he thought of the matter, "we&#xD;
owe all our bad luck to him. He's ready enough to fight,&#xD;
once we get at it, and is not unworthy of the name he&#xD;
bears--' Jack .of the bloody -hand'-but blast .him, had&#xD;
he not, through jealousy, delayed the march of Colonel&#xD;
Holding almost a day, blame me if we wouldn't have&#xD;
made a clean sweep of them ar' thievin' Shawanees."&#xD;
"Don't take it so much to heart, Simon," remarked&#xD;
Bryan, smilingly, "for some of us might~have lost our&#xD;
scalps had your wish been gratified ; and as the savages&#xD;
have retreated without doing any damage to the settle-&#xD;
inents, then let .them go. 'Tis not the first time we 've&#xD;
made a forced march,.to find our wily game fled."&#xD;
- "I'm not so'sartain they've done no injury to the set-&#xD;
tlements," replied Simon, ascending the bank of the river,&#xD;
and moving off 'at a quick pace in the direction of the&#xD;
cave; "it ain't nateral for an Ingen to return from his&#xD;
war-path without striking' a blow."&#xD;
Bryan had noticed, with some degree of uneasiness, the&#xD;
tracesof doubt and care upon the countenance of Simon,&#xD;
nor wasile regardless of the secret fears conveyed in his&#xD;
last remark; buatwithout referring to either of these&#xD;
sources of disquiet, replied, with an appearance of calm.&#xD;
ness he was far from really feeling-&#xD;
"Colonel Holding must be in the neighborhood. of the&#xD;
cave by this time, and, as the advanced guard, we should&#xD;
be there to meet and give him the information we have&#xD;
obtained. We may also, when there, find some trace of&#xD;
the enemy, and perhaps be enabled to unravel the design&#xD;
of our wily foe."&#xD;
Kenton made no reply, but continued to follow back,&#xD;
at a rapid pace, the trail of the Indians leading from the&#xD;

river to the cavern ; and, notwithstanding his positive as-&#xD;
surance of their departure, he did not forget his habitual&#xD;
caution, but stalked along in silence, his eye ever roving&#xD;
far and near, with its usual wary vigilance. When only&#xD;
a short distance from the mouth of the cavern, Kenton's&#xD;
sharp eye, ever on the alert, caught sight of a gliding ob-&#xD;
ject, creeping cautiously along the point of a neighboring&#xD;
ridge, but on, account of the low underbrush, not distinctly&#xD;
in view. Sinking quickly and noiselessly to the earth, the&#xD;
other borderers, without question, following his example,&#xD;
the Scout continued his gaze upon the distant object, as it&#xD;
stole from one covering to another, until at last his watch-&#xD;
fulness was rewarded with complete success; for the-'sub-&#xD;
ject of his suspicious observation, as it approached nearer&#xD;
and nearer to a bald point, gradually assumed the form of&#xD;
a human being, and directly stood out upon the bald&#xD;
point itself, in giant proportion, relieved: by the distant&#xD;
sky; grasping a long rifle, and dressed in the usual flow-&#xD;
ing hunting-shirt of the borderer.&#xD;
"No one can doubt, when the huge form of Rowen&#xD;
stands out agin the sky," remarked Kenton, quietly, his&#xD;
eagle eye losing its gleam of eager curiosity under the&#xD;
certainty of the distant individual being a friend.&#xD;
Springing to his feet, the Scout stood forth on the point&#xD;
of .a little hillock ; but no sooner had he done so, than&#xD;
the person he had been watching, dropped quickly to the&#xD;
ground; nor did he resume his erect position, until Bry-&#xD;
an and the Sergeant, with the remainder of the-scouting&#xD;
party, stood by the side of Kenton; then, as if satisfied,&#xD;
Rowen' again stood boldly forth, g   1ae1ully waving his&#xD;
cap around his head;. and Simon, returning his salute,&#xD;
the other beckoned with his hand, as if to some one be.&#xD;
yond the hill; and sooi a powerful gray horse, mounted&#xD;
by a portly rider, stood by.his side.&#xD;
"Colonel Holding, to a sartainty!1" exclaimed Kenton,&#xD;
with a pleased looks "and as brave a man as ever drew&#xD;
bead upon a red min."&#xD;
It was a wild scene; but a fit picture of the dark and&#xD;
bloody groun,'and its early border warriors-that deso-&#xD;
late, treeess knob, with its two giant occupants;.Rowen&#xD;
&#xD;
standing, leaning with one hand upon his long rifle, whilst&#xD;
with the other he pointed out the little company of Ken&#xD;
ton; an Colonel Holding, mounted upon his powerful&#xD;
gray, and grasping his ready weapon, as with eager eye,&#xD;
he scanned the distant party.&#xD;
But soon this scene was changed ; for Holding, waving&#xD;
his cap, horseman after horseman, to the number of fifty&#xD;
or more, galloped gayly over the ridge ; each grasping&#xD;
his inseparable companion-the rifle; and all dressed in&#xD;
the flowing semi-savage frontier garb; a band of as stal-&#xD;
wart, hard-riding, brave-hearted hunters,.as ever gathered&#xD;
together for a border fray -in the wilds of Kentucky.&#xD;
"4A brave sight I" exclaimed Bryan.&#xD;
"Pity the redskins are gone," chimed in Kenton.&#xD;
But Holding did not give them much time for remark;&#xD;
for, placing himself at the head of his borderers, he gal-&#xD;
loped recklessly down the hill;careless alike of stone and&#xD;
gully, and, in a few minutes, stood in the presence of the&#xD;
Scout and his party, exclaiming in a bold, merry voice,&#xD;
as he drew rein-&#xD;
"What news, Captain Kenton?7 any chance for a brush&#xD;
with the savages ?"&#xD;
"The Shawanee thieves have 'scaped this time, Cob-&#xD;
nel,"'said Simon; "but I ain't sartain but we may have a&#xD;
brush'with them'yet. I'll jist take a scout around the&#xD;
mouth of the cave, and may larn something to settle my&#xD;
doubts."&#xD;
A cloud of disappointment swept over the bold and&#xD;
manly face of Holding, as he heard -of the escape of the&#xD;
savages;- but, wishing to cheer up his'followers, who be-&#xD;
gan to make known their chagrin by sundry uncouth&#xD;
oaths, he quickly resumed his usual dashing, devil-may-&#xD;
care look, exclaiming-&#xD;
"There's no use crying over spilled milk, boys 1 It's&#xD;
devilish hard, I acknowledge, to be cheated out of an ex-&#xD;
pected battle, and just when we were listening for the&#xD;
yell of the enemy; but, as the thievesave fled the coun-&#xD;
try, in the devil's name, let them go; We will pay them&#xD;
up all old scores at some other time. Captain Bead," he&#xD;
continued, turning to our hero, "you wil have to tall us&#xD;

the result of your scout; for I see that your leader, our&#xD;
old friend Kenton, true to his hatred of the redskins, has&#xD;
gone to the cave, to rouse up, if possible,-some trace of&#xD;
our bloodyfoe; and I, for one, won't be sorry if he rouse&#xD;
up the game."&#xD;
Bryan, seeing that the Colonel had but spoken the&#xD;
literal truth, and no more, of-Kenton, and that the worthy&#xD;
Scout, regardless of all military etiquette, had, indeed, after&#xD;
answering the first question of his commander (for that ex-&#xD;
pedition), walked quietly away, as if more intent upon&#xD;
satisfying his own mind, than that of his leader, proceeded&#xD;
at once to obey the command of Holding, by giving a de-&#xD;
tailed account of all that had come under his own cogni-&#xD;
zance, as well as the reasons why Simon, whom they all&#xD;
knew to be well skilled, in the ways of the savage, had&#xD;
concluded thattieir enemy had departed from the neigh.&#xD;
borhood.'&#xD;
"No doubt of it," said a heavy built and dark-visaged&#xD;
man, in a harsh, half'sneering tone, when Bryan had con-&#xD;
cluded his narrative, "and no. one, with three grains of&#xD;
common sense, could have expected anything else. We&#xD;
have come on a fool's errand; and, like fools, have had a&#xD;
weary ride for nothing. Had my advice been taken, we&#xD;
would have remained at home and awaited their attack,'&#xD;
if'they aver had any such a notion, which I very much&#xD;
doubt;, but, as it was not, all that we can do now, is to&#xD;
turn about upon our own trail, and make the best of a&#xD;
'bad job."&#xD;
"Major Malden has been a croaker throughout this ex-&#xD;
pedition," said Bryan, with some heat; not a little ruffled&#xD;
by the rough, ;sneering voice of the last speaker, and the&#xD;
covert charge against.his absent friend, the Scout. "Had&#xD;
he remained at home, where he so much wished to stay,&#xD;
'and not delayed our march for near a day, first by his&#xD;
factious opposition, and then by his dilatory movements,&#xD;
it would have been all the better for us, and I doubt not&#xD;
would have insured the complete success ofour scheme&#xD;
against the enemy; for they have not been gene more&#xD;
than twelve hours, if we niay judge by the traces left at&#xD;
the river."&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, VOW FULFILLED.'             95&#xD;
"Now, may the fiend take me," shouted Malden, his&#xD;
face furious and dark with malignant passion, and spur-&#xD;
ring his horse to free himself from the crowding mass,&#xD;
"if I longer submit to such insinuations against my&#xD;
honor and bravery."&#xD;
"Hold!" exclaimed the clear ringing voice of the&#xD;
Colonel, as he grasped with nervous hand the bridle-rein&#xD;
of Maiden'; " we came here to spill the blood of a savage&#xD;
foe, and not to mingle in strife with each other. It is a&#xD;
foolish quarrel, Malden, and about nothing! !and you,&#xD;
Head, I thought you too cool to become ruffled, because&#xD;
Malden chose, in his rough way, to vent upon the heads&#xD;
of his friends the disappointment he felt-in -not finding&#xD;
an enemy to fight !"'&#xD;
"But has he not charged me with cowardice ?'' vocife-&#xD;
rated Malden, still speaking in high and angry tone.&#xD;
"1I have but spoken the truth," replied Head, firmly;&#xD;
"and if Major Malden chooses to construe my language&#xD;
into a charge of cowardice, then his own conscience-is but&#xD;
supplying a reason for the actions with which I have&#xD;
charged him. The cause of his opposition to this expe-&#xD;
dition, and his delay in getting ready to accompany it, is&#xD;
known only to himself. I have stated facts, and the re-&#xD;
sult of these facts; the reason, if he sees proper, he can&#xD;
give himself"&#xD;
Malden was preparing to give an angry reply, which&#xD;
in all probability would have led to a serious difficulty,&#xD;
and perhaps bloodshed, for'he was hotheaded and brave;&#xD;
and Bryan, though cool, equally as bold aid determined;&#xD;
but Holding, interrupting him, and this time speaking in&#xD;
a firm and authoritative voice, which brooked not oppo-&#xD;
sition, exclaimed :-&#xD;
"Now, by my soul, gentlemen! I 'm your commander&#xD;
during this expedition, and- if your own sense of duty&#xD;
does not put a.stop at, once .to' this silly controversy, I&#xD;
will-and in manner that will not be the most agreeable."&#xD;
"While you stand here, quarrelling among your-&#xD;
selves," said Rowen, for he had been sent by Kenton, and&#xD;
luckily arrived at this crisis of the dispute, "the Indians&#xD;

teeted settlements, and tomahawking your wives and&#xD;
children."&#xD;
"How now, Rowen! what news is this you bring ?";&#xD;
asked Holding, turning quickly to the speaker, and for-&#xD;
getting everything else in his eagerness to learn the&#xD;
foundation.,of this startling intelligence.&#xD;
"Kenton has discovered. a broad triil," said Rowen,&#xD;
"leading out from the cave, and bearing off in the direc-&#xD;
tion of the settlements. He is of the impression, and I&#xD;
doubt not its correctness, that while a part of the savages&#xD;
have dropped down the river in their canoes, a much&#xD;
larger number have passed across the country, for the&#xD;
purpose of pillage and murder."&#xD;
"By my faith !" said Holding, his face growing pale at&#xD;
the thought of the Indian inroad upon the unprotected&#xD;
settlements, "your news is indeed startling, and. I fear&#xD;
the surmise of the Scout is but too true. Call up Ken-&#xD;
ton, for we must be prompt in our movenients."&#xD;
The strife between Malden and Bryan had been hushed&#xD;
at the first sound of Rowen's deep voice, and forgotten&#xD;
entirely by Head, when he heard the fearful tenor of his&#xD;
intelligence; but by Malden it was neither forgotten nor&#xD;
forgiven, as future events will show.; but now, spurring&#xD;
his horse, he exclaimed in a loud tone, and with an an-&#xD;
gry scowl at our hero:-&#xD;
" I have been charged with- delaying the march hither,&#xD;
but no one shall ever have cause to say I was tardy,&#xD;
in revenging the blood of murdered.women and children.&#xD;
Ho! for the settlements, and the. bloody scalps of the&#xD;
savage! Jack Maiden, for one, will not let the moss'grow&#xD;
under his horse's hoof."&#xD;
Aloud, shout greeted this declaration of Malden, and&#xD;
there was a hurried springing to saddle, and hasty prepara-&#xD;
tion for instant march ; but Holding was now engaged in&#xD;
earnest conversation within nton, and though eager and&#xD;
impatient to be off, no done obeyed the stirring summons&#xD;
of the angry major&#xD;
Bryan and higirusty friend, the Sergeant, trembling for'&#xD;
their unprotect d station, and the more so since they had&#xD;
learned frondi . the Scout the presence of their old enemy,&#xD;
&#xD;
had, at the first intimation of the impending danger,&#xD;
sought their horses, and now, as the Colonel concluded&#xD;
his low conversation with Kenton, came galloping up,&#xD;
ready to join the march homeward.&#xD;
"I have no doubt you are correct, and that such are&#xD;
their intentions," said 'Holding, ina loud voice, replying&#xD;
to something Kenton had said; "but if we do not overtake&#xD;
them before they reach the settlements, we will at any&#xD;
rate have a chance of revenging our friends ere.they&#xD;
cross the Ohio."&#xD;
"I've no knowledge of Ingen deviltry, if this ain't thar&#xD;
plan," said Simon, "but if they- are watchful at Vienna,&#xD;
and we be quick in pursuit, I'll give my head for a foot-&#xD;
ball, if one of the tarnal redskins escape us."&#xD;
"God grant' it !" said Holding, solemnly; adding, the&#xD;
moment after, in a voice half command, half inquiry, "but,&#xD;
Captain Kenton, had you not better take your party, and&#xD;
slightly examine this cave? It may result in some dis-&#xD;
covery ; and you can do so, and rejoin us before night-&#xD;
fall."&#xD;
Simon acquiescing in this suggestion of the Colonel,&#xD;
the latter, without more delay, turning to the impatient&#xD;
borderers, called out-&#xD;
"Now, gentlemen! if you will but follow my gallant&#xD;
gray, he will lead you all a merry race! .A long and&#xD;
hard ride is before us, but haste may yetsave our homes&#xD;
from flames, and our wives and children from massacre!&#xD;
Ho, for our homes, for victory, or revenge !"&#xD;
A long wild shout rang out through the silent hills, in&#xD;
answer to the cheering words of Holding; but long be-&#xD;
fore the rocks, and valleys,,-and caves around had ceased&#xD;
to sencfback the dancing echo, the bold Colonel and his&#xD;
fierce 'and hard-riding troopers had vanished from the&#xD;
sight of Kenton and hid companions, and were thunder-&#xD;
ing with headlong speed  vp -the broad trail of their&#xD;
bloody foe!&#xD;
"There they go, as brate a set of'ellows," exclaimed&#xD;
one of the scouts, "as ever shouted bank defiance to an&#xD;
Indian yell; and that Colonel of ours rides as merrily to&#xD;
battle as if going to a wedding."&#xD;

CIPTER      IX.&#xD;
HOIDING, with his troopers, gone, Simon lost no time&#xD;
in entering the, cave. Like the famous war-horse of Job,&#xD;
he. snuffed the battle afar off, and was., therefore, the more&#xD;
anxious'0to fulfil the commands.of the Colonel, that he&#xD;
might the sooner rejoin his friends, in pursuit of the In-&#xD;
dians. Neverthiless, Simon had some curiosity to examine&#xD;
into the mysterious hiding-plice of the savages, and&#xD;
doubted not, ere he was through with his subterranean&#xD;
scout/ to make some-important discovery. He had, him-&#xD;
self, suggested the propriety of the exploration, although,&#xD;
like a wise man, he had left it to his superior in com&#xD;
mand to give the. order, as if springing from his own&#xD;
breast. The honest Scout was a simple, uneducated child&#xD;
of nature; but although artless and, truthful, he was&#xD;
not .ignorant of the human heart; and had, therefore,&#xD;
shrewdly given his views and advice to Holding in pri-&#xD;
vate; and the Colonel, well knowing his skill in Indian,&#xD;
craft, did not hesitate a moment in making the ,plans of&#xD;
Simon his own.. One of the suggestions of Kenton, as&#xD;
we have already hinted, had been to examine the cave,&#xD;
and learn, if possible, whether the savages had anydesign&#xD;
of returning; but the Colonel, seeing the impatience of&#xD;
his fpilowers to be off upon the trail of the 'enemy, could&#xD;
oniidlly twup this hint,, by ordering;the Scout and his&#xD;
small eoipany of spies to make the exploration, whilst&#xD;
he gratified the ardor of his compnions, by immediately&#xD;
cotnencing the pursuit. rt;Simon' undertook this duty&#xD;
all the'iore willingly  he well knew that, in fol-&#xD;
lowing -tip the bro  beaten trail of the Colonel and his&#xD;
troopers, which'   uld do without halting,-and at full&#xD;

"Blame me, boys, if I hadn't made .uy scouts in my&#xD;
day," exclaimed Kenton,' as he picd his way slowly&#xD;
along the -dark passage of the vayern, followed ,by his&#xD;
little troop, ",but darn my buttons, if this 'ere one don't&#xD;
jist beat then all, all hollow, and no mistake. The night&#xD;
I rode into the Wyandot camp wer' some, and Ithought&#xD;
it 'a leetle of the darkest, but 'it wer' nothing , merely a&#xD;
cloudy day, alongside of 'this black  hole. I 've hearn&#xD;
tell that somewhar' over the waters, in that ar' country&#xD;
where a feller by the name of Joseph, who war' allfired&#xD;
vartious, had his coat-tail pulled off by a potter's wife,&#xD;
that you can feel the darkness; but cuss me, if ever that&#xD;
cari be spoken of in the same day with this ; for I swar,&#xD;
this 'ere darkness would float a tomahawk. Whew!"&#xD;
continued the Scout, in the same half serious, half jocular&#xD;
tome; for his companions, overcome by the silence and&#xD;
gloom of the mighty cavern, seemed but little disposed&#xD;
to conversation; "what an elegant place this 'ere tarnal&#xD;
big hole would be for the niggers, for the blackest of&#xD;
them would look a shade white once they-got in here,&#xD;
and thar masters wouldn't be more than mulatters."&#xD;
"See here, boys," remarked Simon, when they had gone&#xD;
near a mile, and were not far distant from the large room&#xD;
where the Indians had encamped,' his spirits by this&#xD;
time becoming a little depressed by the continued silence&#xD;
of his comrades, and the extent an  gloom of the cavern;&#xD;
"I never did much like the ideer4 going under ground,&#xD;
cuss me if I did, and am rather agin graves anyhow;&#xD;
and would jist prefer, if allowed a choice, when my time&#xD;
comes to go on thy ong journey,' as the Ingens have it,&#xD;
to be left out on 'htl opf the earth where 'the'warm&#xD;

death and the grave being a little too mush for h'&#xD;
struck feelingsl!isae&#xD;
"Ain't afraid, Robin, are you ?" replied Simon coolly&#xD;
I ain't afraid of nothin' 'bove ground," retorted the&#xD;
other, with some heat, "and never yet turned my back&#xD;
on friend or foe, and you know it, Simon. But blame&#xD;
me if I wouldn't rather be in the middle of a hundred&#xD;
yellin' Ingens-if it wer' only out in daylight--than be&#xD;
down in this dark hole."_&#xD;
"It ar' a pretty considerable sink-hole I acknowledge,"&#xD;
said the Scout- adding, encouragingly, "but I guess thar's&#xD;
an end to it somewhar', Robi, and when we find it, we'll-&#xD;
then seek daylight agin; for, to'-tell the honest truth, I'd&#xD;
a blame sight rather be out myself"'&#xD;
"But do you see any signs of it ?",said the other, some-&#xD;
what depondingly,and referring to the hoped-for te&#xD;
nation of' their disagreeable journey.&#xD;
"Signs on it ?-see any signs on it ?" replied imon&#xD;
with some warmth; "now, Robin, that's axing a leetle&#xD;
too  much, even of Sharp-Eye; for I can't see the end of&#xD;
my nose without puttin' my torch close enough to singe&#xD;
my whiskers."&#xD;
" Who knows whether we '11 ever come to the end of&#xD;
it ?" said another, in a rather dolorous tone.&#xD;
"Who knows!" replied Simon, sententiously, and be-&#xD;
coming indifferent i proportion to the increasing alarm&#xD;
of his comrades.&#xD;
"And who cares? darn me 'if I ever backed out from&#xD;
a scoutyet," chimed in a new voice, "and ain't going to&#xD;

as the pesky Shawanees."&#xD;
a Nothing shorter," replied he of the Beelzebubic sobi-&#xD;
quet, adding, with a laugh, "look out, Robin, for my&#xD;
uncle's log-heaps !&#xD;
" There they are !" shouted Robin, in. the same breath,&#xD;
starting back in horror, and pointing with his trembling&#xD;
finger. And sure enough, right before them, in the gloom&#xD;
an4 darkness of the cavern; was a small white flame, now,&#xD;
rising, then sinking low again; now bright and distinct,&#xD;
then 'again faint and flickering, like a dying candle.&#xD;
" Down with your torches !" exclaimed the Scout,&#xD;
promptly, "and none of your nonsense, Robin, 'bout&#xD;
the devil, and sich like. That fire wer' kindled by the&#xD;
Shawanees, and if you stand gaping thar, like a born na-&#xD;
teral, some of the villains-if any of them ar' left be-&#xD;
hind-may send a bullet through your head."&#xD;
No sooner had Simon given this verysimple explana'&#xD;
tion, than his hardy followers, forgetting at once their&#xD;
superstitious fears, at the prospect of a fight with the&#xD;
savages, were therriselves again, and ready for battle.&#xD;
Creeping warily towards the fire, expecting every mo.&#xD;
ment to hear the yell of their savage foe, they at length,&#xD;
without interruption, and in silence, stood within the in,&#xD;
fluence of its faint and expiring light. Standing for a&#xD;
moment, with their ears painfully alive to every sound,&#xD;
but hearing nothing, either to arouse their fear or suspi-&#xD;
cion, Simon at length stepped cautiously to the flaming&#xD;
brand, and throwing thereon an    mfull of dry wood&#xD;
founfl close by, soon the grand an spacious camping.&#xD;
roo4 of the Indians was again made cheerful by a plea,&#xD;
sant and brilliant light; and his comrades lending their&#xD;
aid, to increase thie size and steadiness of the burning&#xD;
heap, the vast magnifieace of this wonderful apartment&#xD;
was at once unfolded to Nhei astonished gaze.&#xD;
"A pretty fair cabin, -this!" exclaimed Devil Dick,&#xD;

He could see the flaming torches of the Adians far&#xD;

and hope for thea first time, like the dancing light of the&#xD;

&#xD;
D&#xD;
&#xD;
deep pit, and his head coming in contact with a sharp&#xD;
stone, the blow had rendered him insensible alike-to fea&#xD;
or pain. How long he remained in this condition he was&#xD;
ever ignorant, but he heard nothing moreof his pursuers;&#xD;
was unconscious of their long and strict search, and-knew&#xD;
not of their torches flashing down upon' him!- The frst&#xD;
thing he remembered was; when feeling about with his&#xD;
hand, he was madefully sensible of his dreadful situation,&#xD;
and that he was lying upon the very verge of a still more&#xD;
horrible jit far away below him, into which the-stones,&#xD;
agitated and set in motion by his struggles, fell tossing&#xD;
and tumbling from point to point with fearful and chilling&#xD;
distinctness! Believing all chance of escape n wah  lope-&#xD;
less, and overcome by the loss of blood and thehorrible&#xD;
consciousness of his miserable fate, insensibility=once&#xD;
more came to his relief, and for the time blotted out all&#xD;
memory of his animated or mental agony! Lying in a&#xD;
half dreamy, half-fainting state, his mind a prey to the&#xD;
wild vagaries of fever and darkness, he heard the steps&#xD;
of Kenton and his party when-entering the cave; but,&#xD;
unconscious as to the passage of time, and believing the&#xD;
voice of Simon to be that of Girty; and the tread of the&#xD;
borderer, the footsteps of his enemies in search of him-&#xD;
self, with an effort he restrained a groan of agony, and&#xD;
permitted them to passion withoutainterruption ! Com-&#xD;
bating in his own n4hether he would remain where'&#xD;
he was, and die by piecemeal from starvation and loss&#xD;
of blood, or make known his situation to his blood-&#xD;
thirsty'foes upon their return from the interior of the&#xD;
cavern, andbe killed at once, the sturdy scout had now&#xD;
consumed several-hours and was still undecided! While&#xD;
yet engaged in this mournful struggle of deciding between&#xD;
present death 'by the hand of they savages, or future&#xD;
death from lingering etrvation, or roll over the preci-&#xD;
pice, Connelly heard once more the distant murmur of&#xD;
Simon and his party .approaeb, and hearing, immedi-&#xD;
ately made up his mind, museringto himself-&#xD;
"Pat Connelly has cheated the devils out of their sport,&#xD;

at any rate, and starving ain't much worse than toma-&#xD;

Thus determined,: Connelly remained silent, while&#xD;
friends were passing within twenty feet of the mouth of his&#xD;
horrible tomb! -.Kenton had already passed, and along&#xD;
with him his entire party,-with the exception of Devil&#xD;
Dick, who from some cause, known only to. himself, had&#xD;
lingered behind, when the Irishman, believing all were&#xD;
gone, gave vent to his suppressed and struggling emotions&#xD;
in a loud and bitter groan!&#xD;
"May. the devil take me !" exclaimed Dick, looking&#xD;
quickly around, "if I didn't hear a groan, and of one in&#xD;
mortal agony. Hello, Captain," he shouted, hailing Ken-&#xD;
ton, "agmething's to pay here!"&#xD;
Hurrying to the side of Dobbins, so soon as he heard&#xD;
the cause of his shout,.Kenton called out-&#xD;
"If thar's anybody here, let him speak. If you be-an&#xD;
Ingen, you can jist take your choice, remain silent and be&#xD;
left whar' ygu are, or sing out, and be scalped to a sar-&#xD;

Scout, for _,poor Connelly, wit  is -last hope of im-&#xD;
mediate death or escape gone againn lost conscious-&#xD;

"All a mistake, Dick, thar's no one here !"&#xD;
"Blast me if I didn't hear a groan, and of a man, too,&#xD;
and one in agony,"replied Dick, stubbornly! "Here goes&#xD;
to giye him another chance before we leave this cussed&#xD;

"Then hail'him. yourself" said Denton, carelessly.&#xD;
Hello! hello there !" shouted  ick, 'if you be Indian,&#xD;

""I should know thavoice !" called out Connplly from&#xD;
the pit, for he had been aroused from his momentary&#xD;
stupor.:by the .tentorian lungs.of Dick, and hastened to&#xD;
make kriownhiis whereabouts.&#xD;
&#xD;
"And I that 1" shouted Dick, springing to the mouth&#xD;
of the pit from whence the voice had issued. "Hellof=&#xD;
down there !" he added; waving his torch, "ain't that Roar-&#xD;
ing Pat Connelly, from the upper settlements?"&#xD;
"Faith! it's what's left of him, Dick Dobbins," shouted&#xD;
back Connelly, again recovering his strength and spirits,&#xD;
at.the. certainty of escape from his dreadful, and but a&#xD;
moment since, hopeless tomb.&#xD;
"And how in the name of all that's wonderful did you&#xD;
. ever get into that infernal place ?" said Dick.&#xD;
"Hold, Dick !" exclaimed Kenton, "let's git Connelly&#xD;
out o' this 'ere scrape, and then we can hear all about it!&#xD;
Hello! Pat," he' added, holding his torch over the mouth&#xD;
of the pit, "'tis Simon Kenton speaking, and he wants to&#xD;
know if you. can do anything towards gettin'. yourself&#xD;
out?-&#xD;
"Not much, Captain," said Connelly, "for I am devil-&#xD;
ish nigh used up; but, if you have a rope, or anything&#xD;
of the kind, I have still my hands and arms left, and we&#xD;
may manage the matter in some way !"&#xD;
"He will be bruised against the points of the rock,"&#xD;
said some one.&#xD;
"And divil the bit do I care for the bruising," replied&#xD;
Connelly, hearing the remark; "faith, and St. Patrick, if&#xD;

"From" the way you wag your tongue, Pat," laughed&#xD;
Dick, "after all your bruises, you are not so near dead&#xD;

"Say nothing at all agin the praists, Dick, for Pat 9on-&#xD;

Kenton, by this time, having prepared the rope, and&#xD;
fastened to the end of it a flaming torch, it was thrown&#xD;
carefully over into the pit, and lowered down until within&#xD;
the reach of Connelly; who having fastened it around his&#xD;
body and given them the signal to hoist away, by the&#xD;
united efforts of the party, the burly form of the Irish-&#xD;
man wassoon landed in safety, and -stretched out uipon&#xD;
the smoeoth sandy floor of the cavern.&#xD;
Although accustomed to sights of blood and cruelty&#xD;
and by no means given to express astonishment at ghastly'&#xD;
scenes=Simon and-hisA.companions could not help starting&#xD;
bick  ier   at the sickening spectacle presented in&#xD;

and head 'gashed and gory with, clotted blood, and his&#xD;
entire person covered with inn pmerable dark blotches,&#xD;
the effect of fire, and the barbaroustrture"of the savages.&#xD;
"Never mind, boys!" exclaimed Connelly, noticing their&#xD;
horror and dismay; "divil thebit does Pat Connelly care&#xD;
jefor the like of this. He'll live to. take yet, as many-scalps&#xD;

forgetting to name Girty, and another white'nan, hose&#xD;

or an ally, he was unable to tell.&#xD;
"It wer' that tarnal Frenchman, no .doubt," muttered&#xD;
Simon, "and at some of his diveltry. Blast me, if I&#xD;
didn't always think he had nigger blood in him, and n'ow&#xD;
I know it."&#xD;
Without longer delay, Simon. and his comrades bore&#xD;
Connelly in their arms to the mouth of the cavern, and&#xD;
having sent off lor their horses, covered his bruised body&#xD;
with portions of their own garments, and their saddle-&#xD;
cloths, the former ordering two of his party to place him&#xD;
carefully upon one of their horses, and convey him to the&#xD;
station where he belonged.&#xD;
"Farewell, Connelly," exclaimed Simon, mounting his&#xD;
horse, Dick and the remainder of the party quickly fol-&#xD;
lowing his example; "we can't stay longrow. HE;ard-&#xD;

CHAPTER X.&#xD;
&#xD;
THOSE have never known real pleasure who have not&#xD;
been met at the threshold of home by the cheering smile&#xD;
of~a loving wife, and the glad and loud welcorne of beam.&#xD;
ing-faced children nor on the other hand, have they ever&#xD;
known real grief and sorrow, unless they have seen death&#xD;
mowing down these hotisehold treasures, and crushing&#xD;
into the silent grave these heart moving and heart-che-&#xD;
rished welcomers.&#xD;
" They are all gone !" sighed Bryan, in a hopeless and&#xD;
desponding tone, sinking heavily into a seat, and stupidly&#xD;
Atarig around. upon his disfurnished and disordered&#xD;
apart ident atthe station.&#xD;
:" A11!" mutered Duffe.&#xD;
"We have riddenhard to save them," continued Bryan,&#xD;
in the same despaiing tone; "but the savage has been&#xD;
before us,.IDuffe ; and wife and child, both, both,. have&#xD;
fallen under the bloody tomahawk of our ruthless foe.&#xD;
A curse, a double curse- on the hour," he added, vehe-&#xD;
mently, "when we-persuaded hertoieave the happy home&#xD;
of her childhood, and swore to defend her from all harm,&#xD;
and make her life a long day of sunshine and joy."&#xD;
"See, Duffe, how we have kept our oaths ! the bloody&#xD;
knife has pierced her confiding bosomy and, the cruel&#xD;
tK,  aJ  k dashed out the brains of her litde innocent;&#xD;
tead of being here to defend, heror die-like&#xD;
My- fools were far away, and didnot even hear her&#xD;
cry for-mercy or assistance."&#xD;
For a moment the Sergeant ni&amp;amp;4n reply to the wild&#xD;
ravings of the bereft husband;  the. fierce workings&#xD;
of his: bronzed.cheek, andthe tear dancing in his eye,&#xD;
more eloquently Vhed words, the deep agony of i.&#xD;
t. At length there struggled up, from his ha&#xD;
, the simple;soul-touching, and endearing t&#xD;
y wife!"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Pardon me !" exclaimed Bryan, his own scorched and&#xD;
feverish eye filling up. with emotion when he heard this&#xD;
simple appeal of the Sergeant, "my terrible misfortune&#xD;
has made me selfish and forgetful. We are alike bereft,&#xD;
and alike sorrowers, and our hearts should beat now in -&#xD;
sad sympathy, for we can only weep together"&#xD;
Duffe stretched out his brawny hand, and Bryan, seiz-&#xD;
ing it in his own, exclaimed with vehement energy-&#xD;
"My more than father must not take to heart the wild&#xD;
ravings of his foster child. But, oh! is it not horrible;&#xD;
is it not too dreadful to be reality; and how cani my tor-&#xD;
tured and throbbing soul, knowing and feeling the fear-&#xD;
ful loss it has sustained, still beat with life and agony.&#xD;
My God ! death would be happiness, and eternal forget&#xD;
fulness the dearest boon I could ask, and the greatest&#xD;
favor that could now be-granted me."&#xD;
"'Tis a fearful loss, my boy, and hard to bear," mut-&#xD;
tered the Sergeant, his manly frame trembling with the&#xD;
excess of his feelings, "but we should meet it as brave&#xD;
men, and soldiers."&#xD;
"To think," continued Bryan, his vehemence- giving&#xD;
place to a low tone of sadness, and his flashing eye again&#xD;
looking. bewilderingly-around,."that only a.few days ago&#xD;
we prepared this room, with so much care and love, to&#xD;
protect her from the cold winds of winter ; and we would&#xD;
not have even the chilling air of heaven to blow roughly&#xD;
upon the frail flower we had transplanted to this wild&#xD;
land and now, Duffe, she is cold enough ; and the little&#xD;
floweret she nursed so fondly, is lying all stark and stif by&#xD;
her side, torn frem the parent stem, and she uneonAscious&#xD;

rounded by every comfort; but now look around at this&#xD;
disordered and dismantled roomand weep. It tells us,&#xD;
as--plain as words could tell, that those dove-like eyes will&#xD;
never again gleam forth through dancing tears; and that&#xD;
her lutedlike tongue=is hushed now, and silent, and will&#xD;
never again weep either a sad farewell, or laugh a joy-&#xD;
ousawelcome. She is gone, Duffe; they are all gone; our&#xD;
household ties have been rudely torn asunder ; our little&#xD;
world is desolate, and we can but weep over our crushing&#xD;
desolation."&#xD;
The ,Sergeant could not and would not attempt any&#xD;
consolation. The two .mourning men, the foster-father&#xD;
and his child, wept in.silence.-&#xD;
Holding and his followers, well aware of the bloody&#xD;
intent of the savages, upon whose trail they were follow-&#xD;
ing, and-fully alive to the ruthless, manner in which they&#xD;
usually carried on such expeditions, had pushed gallantly&#xD;
forward, making no stop, except to blow their weary horses;&#xD;
travelling day and night; for their-hardy frames, excited&#xD;
by their:fears and their hopes of vengeance, felt not the&#xD;
toil. Late in the night succeeding the-day upon which&#xD;
they had left -the cavern, Kenton and his little scouting&#xD;
party joined the main band of borderers, and making&#xD;
known at once -their discoveries, and the cruelty of the.&#xD;
Indians to Connelly, added fresh fury,to their rage, and&#xD;
fresh vigor to their march. The savages, when in striking,,&#xD;
distance of the settlements, had divided their forces; a&#xD;
portion, under the command of the chief, bearing away in&#xD;
one, direction, whilst the remainder, under the lead of&#xD;
Girty noved forward to the station .of liead and Duffe..&#xD;
The     ts, wishing to pursue both rails, followed their&#xD;
example; Malden and one party     uing the trace of&#xD;
the chief, and Holding and the ntinuing on after&#xD;
the rnegade.&#xD;

alarm and affliction, led on by his habitual custom of&#xD;
close and minute examination,.had already discovered the&#xD;
dead bodies of the two Indians slain by Titus; and seeing&#xD;
no traces of the inhabitants, had derived some hope and&#xD;
comfort from this fact, which, from a strict examination&#xD;
of the trail of the Indians after they had left the station,&#xD;
where he easily made out the slight foot-prints .of Coma,&#xD;
and heavier shoe of Mrs. Duffe, had been fully satisfied;&#xD;
and now, with joyful alacrity, the honest Scout hastened&#xD;
to bear theses cheerful tidings to his afflicted friends.,&#xD;
"Hello, Mister Bryan, and you, Sargeant," shouted Si-&#xD;
mon, bursting in upon the two afflicted husbands; for&#xD;
Holding and his comrades, although now present at the&#xD;
station, had,.with genuine sympathy, refrained from in-&#xD;
truding upon-the privacy of their distressed companions,&#xD;
"this-'is no time, cuss me if it is," he added, with some&#xD;
warmth to conceal his own emotion, "to be sitting' here,&#xD;
weepin' like a couple of old women!"&#xD;
",Coma !" murmured Bryan, looking stupidly into the&#xD;
face of the intruder.,&#xD;
"My wife !" muttered the Sergeant.&#xD;
"May Sharp-Eye be called a bat, and Simon Kenton&#xD;
roastedto death by the bloody redskins," shouted the&#xD;
Scout, "if they didn't both leave the station wearing' thar&#xD;
own scalps; and cuss me for a liar and a coward,.-if they&#xD;
shan't both return in the same fix, and without losin' a&#xD;

"How!-what do you say? Coma not dead ?" ex-&#xD;

The giant forms of the Sergeant and' Stout trembled&#xD;
and shook with emotion. Theirrough, unpolished hearth&#xD;
were touched by this simple scene; and ,those two men,&#xD;
who had witnessed bloodshed and misery from '.their&#xD;
youth, and had, dared death in every shape and form, now&#xD;
.wept like children.&#xD;
"Don't mke women of us, ;Mr. Bryan," muttered the&#xD;
Scout, dashing aside with horny hand the fast falling tear,&#xD;
adding to himself-" The poor brute 'inds me of that&#xD;
ar' morning in the hills, whenI was simple enough to&#xD;
turn from the chase, and at its 19ow crtake it up in my&#xD;
arms, and bear it many miles home, as ap-rese t-to Miss&#xD;
Coma. Blame me! if I ever know'd the cause off my&#xD;
strange feelins that ar' nornmg. I thoughtt i war'&#xD;
the silence of the forest, or the soft warm sea hine 'on&#xD;
the hills; or, may-be, it wer' -fairy, and had 'charmed&#xD;
me, with its large black eyes, lookin' so beseechin' and&#xD;
natural-like, for it 'minded me of my. little sisters, as they&#xD;
used to seem-a-long time ago ; and, blast me, if Ididn't&#xD;
look upon that ar' animal as if it were a child lost iti th&#xD;
wbqds, and would have fought for it then, all the same as&#xD;
if it had been of a woman born.. But, put it down, M&#xD;
Bryan," he continued in a firmer tone, asi&#xD;
from his reverie,  we aint got-no- time for pi  now.&#xD;
'Tis time we wer'  looking' fdthem tar' pets st6dei by&#xD;
the cussed Shawnt   nd which are dearer to us than&#xD;

Without farther         the Scout turned upon his&#xD;
heel and left the apart  -- owed quickly by the Ser.&#xD;

crod and holy in his estimation by the memory of his&#xD;
lostComa, and which seemed to have so 'depressing an&#xD;
influence upon him, Bryan at once recovered his natural&#xD;
rgy and fire, and was again eager and pressing for&#xD;
ediate pursuit of the enemy. Col. Holding, sym-&#xD;
pat alng with his anxiety, and having been 1pformed by&#xD;
Kenton of the true state of affairs, nd of the captivity&#xD;
of the late occupants, of the station, nade no opposition&#xD;
to his wishes,but readily acquiesced, preparing at once to&#xD;
continue the pursuit. Refreshed by their short rest and&#xD;
slight meal of parched corn and jerked beef, the border-&#xD;
ers, without ,a thought of fatigue, deserted their horses,&#xD;
now too weary to bear them or speed their march, and&#xD;
upon foot, guided by the quick eye of the Scout, once&#xD;
more took the trail ofthe Indians, all eager and elated&#xD;
'with the hope of soon overtaking the enemy, and reveng-&#xD;
ing with bullet and tomahawk the cruelties of their sa-&#xD;
vage foe, Their age and desire for battle were not at all&#xD;
diminished bf' the dreadful traces  of their barbarous&#xD;
enemy; everywhere greeting them along their hurried&#xD;
march; and when they were joined by Malden, and the&#xD;
party under his command, and were told of the terrible&#xD;
butcheries committed by the chief and his band, who it&#xD;
seemed had been even more bloodthirsty and destructive&#xD;
than the vindictive renegade himself, a loud shout of fury.&#xD;
made ;known their exasperation ; and an eager pressing&#xD;
forward told how:anxious they were for the bloody fray,&#xD;
The Indians, as Kenton had divined,.after leaving :the.&#xD;
ttlements, made'a bold, push straight for the mouth of&#xD;
!s'.River, and in their retreat took every precaution&#xD;
to.cover up and conceal their trail. But the whites were&#xD;

near by, the falier and more delicate footprints of&#xD;
Coma.&#xD;
"That's Sally's track, as sure as- my name's Simon,"&#xD;
said the Scout, exultingly, but 'in a. suppressed voice;&#xD;
"and as for that ar' little moccason, I'd swar to its being&#xD;
Miss Coma's 'mong a thousand:"&#xD;
Too willing to be convinced, his hearers raised no&#xD;
objection to these confident assertions; for, indeed, they&#xD;
were satisfied, not only of Simon's shrewdness and quick-&#xD;
ness in all such matters, but of his truthfulness in the&#xD;
present' instance; and in their good-humor, went even so&#xD;
far as to acknowledge,, what at any rate was well worthy&#xD;
of a doubt, the broad and almost shapeless footprint of&#xD;
the: honest black.&#xD;
" May I never agin be called Sharp-Eye," said Simon,&#xD;
"if that ain't the track of Titus; and what's more, wer'&#xD;
made a purpose, and for my eye."&#xD;
"You are darnation sharp on an Ingen trail, I'll ac-&#xD;
.knowledge," said one of the party, "but how you know&#xD;
that track were made a.purpose, and for .your eye, is just&#xD;
a buttonhole above me, as sure as fallin' off a log."&#xD;
"It's easy enough to one that's up to sich 'things,"&#xD;
replied Simon, confidently ; "and Titus ain't scouted&#xD;
'long with me for nothin'. Don't you see," he added,&#xD;
with a somewhat contemptuous look at the 'doubter, "that&#xD;
this ar' a good place to leave a deep trail, and what do&#xD;
you think Titus's foot were doin' out thar' off of the path,&#xD;
and pintin' that ar' way a solitary foot, without its feller&#xD;
if it warn't to catch my eye? Cuss me, if I don't bet a&#xD;
hundred-buffalo hides to a mink skin that the nigger&#xD;
thought of me when he made that ar' track."&#xD;
Convinced by the reasoning of the Scout, or, to be more&#xD;
truthful, driven, lika many persons-both before and since&#xD;
that time,- from his '  opinion, by the bold tone of&#xD;
Kenton, and confident offer of a bet, the doubter gave in&#xD;
at once, and made no farther opposition, being very glad&#xD;
to surrender at discretion.&#xD;
But the elated hopes of Bryan and Duffe, excited by&#xD;
this slight trace of their lost wives, were doomed to be&#xD;
'of but ,ort duration; for only a few hundred yards&#xD;

further on they met with a horrible and shocking proof&#xD;
of the wanton barbarity of the savages; and were made&#xD;
fully conscious of the slight dependence they cold put&#xD;
in' the continuance of InI*dian mercy, by the person of an&#xD;
infant with its brains daalied out against a tree, and but&#xD;
a few 'steps distant the mangled body of the mother, slain&#xD;
no doubt for mourning, over the fate of her murdered&#xD;
child: A low shout of rage and horror greeted this&#xD;
mournful spectacle, and Bryan was so overcome by&#xD;
dreadful fear that he could scarce totter near enough to&#xD;
satisfy himself that it was not Coma and his own loved&#xD;
boy.&#xD;
Tenderly laying. the corpse of the unfortunate motherr&#xD;
beneath the protecting shade o a wide-spread oak, and&#xD;
elose by her side the body of her infant, the borderers,&#xD;
with many an oath and'vow of revenge, continued their&#xD;
narch.  They were now in the vicinity where they&#xD;
expected to find, the enemy ; and, with that caution&#xD;
acquired by long and dangerous hostile intercourse with&#xD;
the treacherous savage, began to move at a slower pace,&#xD;
and with more care^ and wariness, than they had as yet&#xD;
exhibited. To guard against surprise,.or an ambuscade,&#xD;
Kenton, with a picked band of the most daring  hunters&#xD;

marching in silence and using the utmost caution, the&#xD;
determined pioneers hoped to fall upon the enemy, when&#xD;
unprepared either for escape or resistance, and thus take&#xD;
Woody and signal vengeance.&#xD;
The Shawanee 'warriors, glad with their late victories&#xD;
and successful retreat, were rejoicingpi th savage glee&#xD;
over the bloody trophies of their prowess; their pale-r&#xD;
browedtpiners, hopeless of res, were weeping over&#xD;
their mriser  e fate; while but ihTw miles distant, with&#xD;
stern knit brows, and steady nerves, and grasping their&#xD;
long deadly rifles, came agallant band of hardy hunters,&#xD;
trooping through the dark- forest, ready to turn the&#xD;
rejoicings of£ the former into howls of woe, and the tears&#xD;

CHAPTER XI:&#xD;
THOSE only who have wandered through the grand old&#xD;
forests of Kentucky, more grand and magnificent along&#xD;
the alluvial bottoms even than upon the high and fertile&#xD;
plains of the interior, can, for a moment, imagine the wild&#xD;
picturesqueness of the Indian encampment at the conflu-&#xD;
ence of the Ohio and Green,-the two most beautiful rivers&#xD;
of the West. On one hand, stretching far away, gliding&#xD;
along in peaceful majesty and beauty, were the bright&#xD;
waters of the Belle River; while on the other, enshrouded&#xD;
and shaded by the overhanging forest, slept the deep&#xD;
green waves of her fairest daughter. -Spring had come&#xD;
and gone; Summer had been there and passed away;&#xD;
and now Autumn, with her magic brush, like some fading&#xD;
beauty, was busy touching the rich, verdant foliage of her&#xD;
sister seasons, and changing their flowing robes of eme-&#xD;
rald green to a more gaudy vesture of red and gold. The&#xD;
smooth-barked beech, the heaven-touching poplar, and&#xD;
gnarled oak, the offspring of a thousand years, were all&#xD;
there, crowded together, a mingled mass of matted, tangled&#xD;
luxuriance, shutting out the darting rays of the piercing&#xD;
sun, and covering7 far and near, the entire earth with the&#xD;
cooling and dark sbade of their wide-spreading, over-&#xD;
arching limbs. Mind with these, springing up from&#xD;

THE WINTER LODGE;&#xD;
&#xD;
dark purple grapes, a richer air of magnificence and&#xD;
luxury to the wild scene.&#xD;
Halting upon this lovely spot, the Indians were some-&#xD;
what surprised at the non-arrival of their friends with the&#xD;
boats. It had been determined, before they left the cave,&#xD;
in a council of war, that a small number of warriors should&#xD;
drop down Green River, and await the coming of the&#xD;
larger party, at its- confluence with the Ohio, that they&#xD;
might embark, at once, with their spoils and prisoners,&#xD;
and following the course of the latter stream to the mouth&#xD;
of the Wabash, proceed up this river to their own coun-&#xD;
try, and thus leave no trace of their flight. Fearful of&#xD;
some mishap to their comrades, whilst anxiously awaiting&#xD;
the coming of their canoes, the savages were not idle, but,&#xD;
on the contrary, were busily engaged, or at least a por-&#xD;
tion of them, in preparing rafts to cross the Ohio. They&#xD;
wished, at any rate, to put this stream between themselves&#xD;
and any pursuing force; and while a part of the band,&#xD;
under the directions of the renegade, were.thus laboring,&#xD;
the' others guarded the prisoners, or lounged about, turn-&#xD;
ing many an anxious glance up the waters. of the Green,&#xD;
hoping to catch eight of their returning companions.&#xD;
But their anxious watching met with no success, and&#xD;
as far as the eye could reach, the deep green waves of&#xD;
that silent 'iver continued calm and smooth; unruffled,&#xD;
save by the darting of the playful fish, or the soft bosom&#xD;
of the rejoicing water-fowl. ' They were ignorant that&#xD;
their companions had all fallen into the snare prepared&#xD;
for them by the Scout; not one Qf them escaping to guide&#xD;
the light canoe, or bear the dreadful story of their massa-&#xD;
cre to their waiting chieftain.&#xD;
"Gor'a mighty! I hope dem tarnal rascals dey are look-&#xD;
ing out for, may neber come," said.Titus, in a low voice,&#xD;
after trying in vain to cheer .up his weeping mistress; who&#xD;
was sitting iwar by, whilst he, with his hands bound be-&#xD;
hind'hi'n, and fastened securely to a tree, was kept in&#xD;
order by theipresence ofa grim warrior, who stood lean-&#xD;
ing against the trunk Qf an oak, but a few paces distant.&#xD;
"Hi ! hiI" he'. continued, with a low chuckle of delight,&#xD;
dat wer a good nofion of Massa Simon to send word to&#xD;

Colonel, who jist laugh all de time he fight. 0 golly,&#xD;
gosh! won't dey make dese dam warments jump Jim&#xD;
Crow, for de way dey treated dis here nigger ?"&#xD;
To these encouraging remarks of the faithful black,&#xD;
Coma made no reply, merely raising her head a moment,&#xD;
then letting it sink again hopelessly upon her bosom,&#xD;
whilst she folded still tighter in her arms the unconscious&#xD;
person of her wearied and sleeping infant.&#xD;
"Den'member, Miss Coma," said the black, still hoping&#xD;
to arouse and cheer up his drooping mistress; "dar's dat&#xD;
Capting Montlack, and tho' he wer a bad man when 'we&#xD;
wer all in de Carolinas, him say he am sorry for it now,&#xD;
and will try and git de Ingens'to let us go. Him's an old&#xD;
friend of dat dam willian, Girty, and says him can bribe&#xD;
de rascel to let us loose, and will do' so; and tho' him&#xD;
wer' a monstrous liar when we know'd him, he talks&#xD;
mighty fair now, and dis child tinks he tell de truth."'&#xD;
To the great surprise of Titus, Coma met this last at-&#xD;
tempt of his at consolation with even less favor than his&#xD;
former trials; for at the mention of Captain Jean, she&#xD;
shudderingly drew back, looking quickly around, and&#xD;
with a deep. sigh, or rather groan, murmured-&#xD;
"Don't mention that-wicked man, I fear him even more&#xD;
than the savages; he talks smooth and cunningly, as he&#xD;
used to do when I believed him good and kind, and found&#xD;
him cruel and false. In spite of his hypocrisy, he could&#xD;
but look glad when he told me my father's heart was&#xD;
still cold against his child. I believe him not, and will&#xD;
not trust him. You don't know him, Titus; and- ;fear&#xD;
his presence here, although a prisoner himself; haa somp-&#xD;

comfort, at least to agree with his mistress, "and if she&#xD;
say. de word, den Titus am ready to tell him so."&#xD;
"Say nothing, but trust hirn not," said Coma, quickly.&#xD;
Somewhat disappointed at the manner in which his mis-&#xD;
tress, had received his offer to make known to the Captain&#xD;
the estimation in which he was held;.Titus made no far-&#xD;
ther remark, but with a tug at his bonds, and a no very&#xD;
devout ejaculation upon the heads of his captors, relapsed&#xD;
into silence.&#xD;
It may be proper to state just here, that Montlack, with&#xD;
his usual cunning, that he might have a greater influence&#xD;
over the mind of Coma (for 'he intended, upon a proper&#xD;
occasion, to renew his suit to his cousin, whom he be-&#xD;
lieved to be a widow, as Girty, false and deceitful as him-&#xD;
self, and wishing to secure the entire reward, had led him&#xD;
to believe her husband dead), had prevailed without diffi-&#xD;
culty, upon his renegade associate, to treat him in every&#xD;
respect, at least when in her presence, as a prisoner. The&#xD;
Captain had a double object -in view in pursuing this&#xD;
course, the one we have already mentioned, and to secure&#xD;
his own safety, in case his savage allies should meet with&#xD;
defeat, and he fall into the hands of the exasperated set-&#xD;
tlers, whom he had doubted not, would treat him as the&#xD;
worst of enemies, did they believe him in any way con-&#xD;
nected with the Indians. Under this garb, then, had he&#xD;
approached, and made himself known to the miserable&#xD;
Coma. He could scarce conceal his exultation at behold-&#xD;
ing her again in his power; and though he hated her, yet&#xD;
would he make her his wife, to secure his-fortune and re-&#xD;
venge; and with these objects ever present in his mind,&#xD;
he managed to throw over his hypocritical countenance&#xD;
.   air of pity, and even a look of sympathy and kind-&#xD;
ness, well adapted to deceive an artless and forgiving&#xD;
heart.&#xD;
B the plotting villain. met with no encouragement in&#xD;
his a ances; for, after her first surprise at his presence,&#xD;
Coma instinctively shrank away from him, as from the&#xD;
golden folds of the beautiful garter-snake, and would not&#xD;
trust either his smiles or his sighs of sympathy. He had -&#xD;
f9p!ten' that the artless heart, though easy enough to&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, VOW FULFILLED.&#xD;
&#xD;
127&#xD;
&#xD;
deceive, deceived once, never trusts again, and, therefore,&#xD;
all his cunning calculations about gaining her affections&#xD;
by pretending to share or sympathize in her sorrows, were&#xD;
entirely thrown away. Observing her evident horror at&#xD;
again '1eholding him, Montlack merely made known his&#xD;
own captivity, aid hope of escape through the instru-&#xD;
mentality of Girty, promising to use every exertion to&#xD;
secure her the like boon of freedom; and, adding that it&#xD;
would be best for them to be as little together as possible,&#xD;
and act towards each other as- perfect strangers, so that&#xD;
the renegade might not discover their relationship, and&#xD;
become extravagant in his demands, turned from her and&#xD;
walked away. The Captain had suggested this fear to&#xD;
save himself the inconvenience of a feigned captivity,&#xD;
which proved rather annoying from the tightness of his&#xD;
bonds. Girty, with a spice of the devil, or low humor,&#xD;
having insisted upon making them very unnecessarily&#xD;
secure.&#xD;
Uneasy and restless when in his company, Coma made&#xD;
no objection to this plausible suggestion, for she was glad&#xD;
of any cause or excuse that might 'secure his absence,&#xD;
and relieve her from his loathsome presence.&#xD;
As yet, they had only had this one meeting, although&#xD;
Montlack had managed to have a long conversation with&#xD;
Titus, and, as the reader may have already gathered,&#xD;
fully persuaded the unsuspecting black of his repentance&#xD;
for past offences, and friendly intentions for the present.&#xD;
"Miss Sally," said the negro, dnce more breaking si-&#xD;
lence, and turning from his mistress to the-more philoso-&#xD;
phical spouse of the Sergeant, who was sitting close by,&#xD;
and who looked for all the world as indifferent as if se-&#xD;
curely ensconced in her own arm-chair, and by her own&#xD;
fireside-" bime-bye, you'll be hearin' de shout-ob Massa&#xD;
Bryan, and de Sergeant,. and Massa'Simon; and when&#xD;
you does-Ay, golly !-dis nigger jist want you to cut&#xD;

Madam Duffe, whose war spirit had not yet entirely&#xD;
vanished, readily promised to execute this wish of Titus;&#xD;
and the black, restless and uneasy under his bonds after&#xD;

&#xD;
looking up at the slanting rays of the 'sun-for it was&#xD;
now evening-and then casting his eyes down upon the&#xD;
river, where the savages were still waiting the coming of&#xD;
their canoes, muttered, with a dissatisfied look-&#xD;
"Dar's a gentleman ob color what am gettin' kind o'&#xD;
obflusticated, for de sun am goin' down, and no Massa&#xD;
Bryan come yit. But de dam Ingen canoe," he added,&#xD;
in a better humor, "no come neither. I golly!1 dese&#xD;
blasted strings," he continued, after a moment of silence,&#xD;
shaking and jerking his head, and moving restlessly so&#xD;
far as his bonds would permit, "dey jist hold dis nigger's&#xD;
hands tight 'ntiff, while dem dam 'sketers eat him up.&#xD;
Whew!" said Titus, blowing out a long breath, as one of&#xD;
his tormentors settled on the end of his nose, and he was&#xD;
unable to brush it off, "did any one eber see sich imper-&#xD;
entcritters?"&#xD;
But Titus's complainings were suddenly broken in&#xD;
upon, by a single loud and exultant shout, followed&#xD;
quickly by adeafening yell; and seeing his guards hurry&#xD;
down to the water's. edge, his eyes were turned imme-&#xD;
diately in that direction, and only removed when, with a&#xD;
pitying look at the pale face of his sorrowing mistress,&#xD;
he muttered-&#xD;
"De dam Ingen boat, sure 'nuff, and no Massa Bryan&#xD;
come yit !" .a&#xD;
But Bryan had come; and now, along with Simon and&#xD;
his little party of scouts, had for some time been con-&#xD;
cealed only a short distance off, anxiously waiting the&#xD;
approach of Holding. They, too, had heard and were&#xD;
startled by the loud yells of the savages.&#xD;
"Somethin'has pleased the dratted devils," muttered&#xD;
Kenton, in a low undertone; "see how they are leaving'&#xD;
the prisoners unguarded, and runnin' down to the river!"&#xD;
"Now, to the rescue!1" said Bryan, half springing to&#xD;
his feet, and speaking in a deep and excited whisper.&#xD;
"Not yet, Bryan !" exclaimed Simon, laying his hand&#xD;
heavily upon the shoulder of the impatient husband,&#xD;
"you'll spile all; i ar' more than probable thar boats&#xD;
have shaped the l6okout at Vienna, and the redskins ar'&#xD;
rejoicing' over thar safe arrival. But never mi  Iet 'em&#xD;

shout away; I guess we'll soon make 'em sing another&#xD;
tune. The .Colonel heard that yell, and won't linger now.&#xD;
Cuss me if they ain't jist welcome to my scalp, if we&#xD;
don't make 'em laugh on t'other side of the mouth."&#xD;
Although he' evidently did it with great reluctance,&#xD;
Bryan at length submitted to the wiser counsel of the&#xD;
more cautious Scout, once more sullenly resuming his&#xD;
recumbent position.&#xD;
The uproar in the Indian camp had1not, as Kenton&#xD;
imagined, been excited by the appearance of their flotilla,&#xD;
but of a solitary canoe, with a single occupant. It floated&#xD;
slowly, but steadily down the current of the river, and&#xD;
the Indians upon the shor6 were not a little astonished&#xD;
that the warrior sitting silently at its stern made no mo-&#xD;
tion, either to guide or hasten its progress; nor had he&#xD;
sent back an answering yell to their loud shouts of wel-&#xD;
come. The canoe, with its strangely silent occupant, was&#xD;
now opposite the camp, but still the warrior sat silent&#xD;
and immovable, looking neither to the right nor left; nor&#xD;
moved he hand or paddle, but passed steadily onward&#xD;
without any token . of recognition to his wondering&#xD;
friends. At a motion of the chieftain's hand, one of the&#xD;
young warriors now dashed fearlessly into the water,&#xD;
and swimming to the side. of the canoe, clambered over.&#xD;
For a moment the young Indian stood up in the bow of&#xD;
the little boat, with the water dripping from his naked&#xD;
and athletic person, earnestly regarding the silent warrior&#xD;
sitting in the stern; then, with a wild gesture of astonish-&#xD;
ment, he threw up his hand, sending forth a loud, peculiar&#xD;
yell.&#xD;
"The death halloo,", muttered Simon, in a smothered&#xD;
undertone; "the boys at Vienna have peppered some of&#xD;
the rascals to a sartainty."&#xD;
As we have before intimated, the entire flotilla of the&#xD;
savages had fallen into the snare prepailed for them by&#xD;

of the reckless foresters, however, not satisfied with their&#xD;
complete victory, shad, in a -moment of thoughtlessness,&#xD;
set one of the canoes adrift, after having first placed&#xD;
therein the body oCf  a dead warrior, dressed out in a rag..&#xD;

mockeiy, and the reckless youngsters little cared or&#xD;
thought what might be the result; indifferent alike&#xD;
whether it 'bore news to their friends of the success of&#xD;
their watchfulness, or to the savages, of the defeat and&#xD;
bloody end of their comrades. It is needless for us to&#xD;
say that the canoe, with its strange and silent occupant,&#xD;
which had attracted theattention of the savages, and&#xD;
which the young warrior-was now rapidly guiding ashore,&#xD;
bore the body of this mutilated Indian, deprived of his&#xD;
scalp, and still disgraced with the-mockitg garb thrown&#xD;
around his shoulders by the gibing borderers.&#xD;
. A wild shout of rage and vindictive fury greeted the&#xD;
arrival of the young warrior and the stark occupant of&#xD;
the canoe, followed in quick succession by a shrill and&#xD;
s0oul-harrowing yell!&#xD;
s Tharrgoesthe scalp halloo," exclaimed the Scout, with&#xD;
startling emphasis, "we can wait-no longer for the Colo-&#xD;
nel now! To save the prisoners from the tomahawk,&#xD;
we'll have to use all speed !"&#xD;
Springing to his feet, and quickly followed by his fear-&#xD;
less little. band, the Scout darted from his place of con-&#xD;
cealment, and, gliding with rapid bound through the dark&#xD;
foliage of the forest,~stood the next minute by the side of&#xD;
the wondering prisoners !&#xD;
"Down to the ground, allyou women," shouted Simon,&#xD;
maintaining to the last his entire self-possession; "1 say&#xD;
doWri, Miss Coma," he added, in a still more emphatic&#xD;
voice, seeing her yet standing;""or you and the baby&#xD;
may receive the bullets intended for stouter hearts!1"&#xD;
Bryan, springing to the side of his wife, forcibly' placed&#xD;
her in a sitting position, protected by thetrunk of a huge&#xD;
oak, and, with, a murmured word of -encouragement,&#xD;
hastein back to take his place- along with his stout-&#xD;
heait&amp;amp; comrades! *&#xD;
"'Member your promise, Miss Sally," shouted Titus,&#xD;
"dis child don't want to be tied up here and hab no hand&#xD;
in de fight!"°&#xD;
Hearing' the call of Titus, the Scout saved Madam&#xD;
'Duffe the trouble and danger of fulfilling her promise,&#xD;
which, notwithstanding his caution, she was hastening to&#xD;

" Gor'a mighty," exclaimed Titus, looking at his hands&#xD;
swollen and cut by the thongs of his captors, "de dam&#xD;
Ingen treat old Titus like a nigger; but neber mind, dis&#xD;
child's time come now, and may-be he ivon't pay 'em back!"&#xD;
But scarcely had .Simon and his daring little band&#xD;
finished these hasty preparation for the reception of the&#xD;
savages, before twenty or more of the Indians, darting up&#xD;
from the water-side, made their appearance upon the brow&#xD;
of the shore!m For atmoment they stood as if overcome&#xD;
with astonishment, at .the unexpected -presence'of the&#xD;
whites; but a deadly volley from the rifles of the Scout&#xD;
and his party stretched several of their number upon the&#xD;
ground, and the Qthers, brought to their senses by the fate&#xD;
of their comrades, recoiled quickly under the protection&#xD;
of the bank! But their retreat was only for a moment,&#xD;
for hardly had the smoke from the rifles of Kenton's&#xD;
party cleared away, before Girty and the chieftain, lead-&#xD;
ing on their yelling crew, poured forth a volley in return,&#xD;
and,ubrandishing their tomahawks, rushed furiously upon&#xD;
the unshrinking borderers!'&#xD;
It was a trying. moment upon the nerves of that little&#xD;
band, for two or more of their number lay dead or&#xD;
wounded upon the ground, and ten times their own force&#xD;
were now rushing forward to the onset ! But, like good&#xD;
men and true, they were ready to meet. the storm, and&#xD;
had no thought of giving back one inch!&#xD;
"Remember Pat Connelly!' shouted Devil Dick, spring-&#xD;
ing madly forward over bush, brier, and log; and Ken-&#xD;
ton, turning his head at the welcome voice of the madcap&#xD;
Dobbins, saw that Holding and his company were only&#xD;
a few paces distant, and speeding with all haste to the&#xD;
rescue.&#xD;
"Remember Pat Connelly!" was his answering cry;&#xD;
with one sweep of his powerful arm dashing out the&#xD;
brains of a fierce warrior!&#xD;
"Remember Pat Connelly!" again shouted Dick, spring-&#xD;
ing to his side and driving the point of his tomahawk&#xD;
deep into the sIkull of the young Shawanee chieftain!&#xD;

"Here's for Coma," exclaimed Bryan, as histrifle came&#xD;
down with crushing force upon the brov of the furious&#xD;
renegade!&#xD;
. And here for Sally," shouted the stern Sergeant,&#xD;
cleaving with bloody axe the head of his savage 'oppo-&#xD;
nent.&#xD;
"And here for-de dam Ingen himself," said old Titus,&#xD;
driving his knife deep into the bpsom of his struggling&#xD;
foe !&#xD;
The battle was now no longer a hand to hand fight ; for&#xD;
the Indians having met with such fatal resistance from&#xD;
the determined bravery of Kenton and his party, and&#xD;
noticing the fresh arrival of Holding, with a much larger&#xD;
force quickly drew back to cover, taking advantage of&#xD;
every covert .and' tree for concealment and protection,&#xD;
Whilst they kept up, in their usual manner, a constant and&#xD;
deadly fire. The whites were not backward in following&#xD;
the. example set them by the savages, and soon the dark&#xD;
and silent forest rang with shout and yell and rifle-shot;&#xD;
and the wild fray, pressed from point to point, grew more&#xD;
bloody and fatal, as the Indians, forced back by the&#xD;
superior numbers of the borderers, became from their&#xD;
desperate situation more reckless and daring. Upon the&#xD;
brow of the shore, the savages made one more desperate&#xD;
and gallant struggle for victory; but the hardy settlers&#xD;
were equally brave aid determined-; and the Indians, ex-&#xD;
posed to a concentrated fire were once more compelled&#xD;
to fall balk. It was no longer a contest for victory on&#xD;
the part of the savages but 'a sullen struggle for life and&#xD;
revenge ; and right nobly did those red children of the&#xD;
forest, battling for the ancient rights of their race, con-&#xD;
tinue that bloody,:"and, to themselh6s most destructive&#xD;
battle. 'Twas the savage against the civilized man ; brute&#xD;
force and courage against semi-savage skill and daring.&#xD;
But the fire of the Indians every moment became weaker&#xD;
and weaker, and gradually pressed from tree to tree, and&#xD;
covert to covert, the savages, only a small number now&#xD;
being left alive, at length found themselves forced to the&#xD;
water's edgg, standing upon the open beach, and fully ex-&#xD;
posea to the unerring aim of the furious borderers.&#xD;

Itf&#xD;
&#xD;
Only one warrior of all; that fierce band of Shawanees&#xD;
was now left alive and unwounded; and he, seeing that&#xD;
all hope of escape or revenge was alike almost desperate,&#xD;
with a loud yell of rage and-defiance, threw aside his rifle&#xD;
aid tomahawk, and sprang boldly into the bright waves&#xD;
of the Ohio.&#xD;
"A last shot for Pat Connelly!" shouted Devil Dick,&#xD;
drawing up his rifle, and taking deadly aim at the young&#xD;
savage, as he gallantly buffeted the. waters, striking out&#xD;
towards the northern shore.&#xD;
"Not so, Dick !" exclaimed Holding, turning aside his&#xD;
gun; "although an Indian, he's a gallant fellow, and we&#xD;
must give him this last chance for life. Our victory is&#xD;
complete, and our revenge has been sufficiently bloody&#xD;
without. his- death; so. let him go. He'll be a sad mes-&#xD;
senger to his nation, and a. living warning against an-&#xD;
other expedition on this side of the river."&#xD;
"You are right, Colonel," said Dick, lowering his.&#xD;
rifle, "the poor fellow has already one fierce foe to strug-&#xD;
gle with ere he gains yonder shore; and Dick Dobbins is&#xD;
the last man alive to show foul play."&#xD;
Gallantly and nobly did they young savage make this&#xD;
last struggle for life; And those who but a moment ago&#xD;
thirsted for his blood, stood how eagerly watching his&#xD;
exertions, and wishing him     ucess.&#xD;
His efforts were at length      with success; and&#xD;
his contest with the floods-prove oro6 Ttunae&amp;amp;than&#xD;

course, beheld him at last mount the farther sabime;' and&#xD;
ere he darted into the wood, heard his loud yell of defi-&#xD;
ance, to which, now no longer feeling any enmity, they&#xD;
sent back a loud shout of applause and encouragement.&#xD;
"A noble fellow !"'said Holding, turning away, "and I&#xD;
trust he will sleep again in his own wigwam."&#xD;
"A bloody, murdering villain," replied Malden, in a&#xD;
deep ard sullen voice; "and I,.for one, trust that he maY&#xD;

This was the last struggle ever made by the Indian for&#xD;
his loved hunting-ground; and that solitary warrior, if&#xD;
he escaped the dark wish of Malden, and found his way,&#xD;
through the trackless forest, to the desolate wigwams.of&#xD;

CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
T is somwhat strange (but nevertheless, when We&#xD;
glance ovpr the  istory of our country, we find it to be&#xD;
as true asstrange) how constant the hatred, and how de-&#xD;
tegnined he animosity ever existing between the Anglo-&#xD;
Salon and Indian race. -From the very first settlements&#xD;
made upon the seaboard to the final extinction of the&#xD;
red man on the eastern side of the Mississippi, we find&#xD;
these two races ever jealous of each other, and ever en-&#xD;
gaged in bloody hos   y   The French, on the other&#xD;
hand,jn the settle   s upon the lakes-and upon the&#xD;
shorepf the Misissippi, and in the ,Illinois territory-&#xD;
were eve  ceived and treated as friends by the avage,&#xD;
andliyed almost without forts or stations-or indeed any&#xD;
grygeat watchfulness, and comparatively in +the most&#xD;
~fec safety and.secprity. It seen as if the Indian&#xD;
hadgpresoence of his approaching fate, and knew by&#xD;
instinct,'that the Saxon was to b;hi- destroyer, and the&#xD;
f ture possessor of his hunting-gounds. Upon the foot-.&#xD;
priuts of thii race did he eve  ok with fear and trem-&#xD;
bling, and against these didtbe ever turn his wrath and&#xD;
hatred antvengeance. And the;Saxon, with like seeming&#xD;
fatality, ev tune withv equal' bitterness and hatred&#xD;
against th in a,&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, VOW FULFILLED.        135&#xD;
&#xD;
The French, however, were never regarded by the&#xD;
Indian in the same light as the Saxon; they were not&#xD;
esteemed as foes, or permanent settlers, and were allowed,&#xD;
e ingly, without any fear of their increase, or of future&#xD;
co   quences, to-build their hamlets, wherever they saw&#xD;
proper. But no sooner had the axe of the Saxon felled&#xD;
a tree, and his rugged cabin reared its humble roof in the&#xD;
,forest, than the tomahawk was unburied-the yell of the&#xD;
savage was heard in the lonely valley, and, he rushed at&#xD;
once to sweep from the face of the earth the lodge of his&#xD;
hated enemy.&#xD;
This hatred was at no time and in no place exhibited&#xD;
with more intensity, and with more ferociousness, than in&#xD;
the  rly settlement of Kentucky; and the battle we have&#xD;
just escribed, is only one of the many hundreds fought&#xD;
by the Saxon and Indian, warring for the possession of&#xD;
the-dark and bloody ground.&#xD;
But the. battle was now over, and night had spread her&#xD;
funeral wing, made more sad and glooiny, and solemn,&#xD;
from the dark and sombre. shades of the forest, over the&#xD;
scene of the recent bloody combat between the wite&#xD;
and the red man. 'Many goodly forms, fashioned after&#xD;
the image of their Creator, now lay stark and cold and&#xD;
stiff, careless alike of dark ness and night-of victory or&#xD;
defeat, for theirs was not the sleepof ease of weariness,&#xD;
but the long slumber of death. The Indian dying, as&#xD;
warriors wish to die, witl the bloody tomahawk gleaming&#xD;
in his hand, and the bullet through his heart, lay close&#xD;
alongside with the grim oppressor of his: race.: The&#xD;
fierce borderer, still smiling and exultant, slept his long&#xD;
sleep, beneaththe sombre shades of the forestehe had love&#xD;
so much in life, looking, as he lay there with his upturned&#xD;
face, still grasping.with icy hand his long rifle Or boody&#xD;
knife, as if only resting after, a long day's mareh, and&#xD;
ready at the first note; c  larr, to spring up again, and&#xD;
renew the bloody fight. But Che Indian brave has made&#xD;
his last foray upon earth, iid taken his last scalppand&#xD;
has gone forth upon his weary path to the happy hunting-&#xD;
grounds of his race; and the half civilized, ipneer will&#xD;

back defiance to his wild and soul-chilling yell. In life,&#xD;
they were deadly, unforgiving foes-in death, they sleep&#xD;
together; nd the white and the red man are at last&#xD;
friends. They have gone forth upon the long trail-of&#xD;
eternity together, and conqueror and conquered, oppressor&#xD;
and oppressed, now stand at the judgment bar of their&#xD;
qeator; and it is beyond-the ken of mortal to say, who&#xD;
stocad there, the most justified.-               .&#xD;
The last yell of the savage-thy solitary defiance of&#xD;
the fleeing warrior, had now died away, and the moans&#xD;
of his dying comrades, stricken down by bullet, tomahawk,&#xD;
and knife, had sunk one by one into the silence-of death.&#xD;
The wild shout of the furious white had likewise :given&#xD;
place to, silence and grief; for although victorio. the&#xD;
victory had been obtained at a bloody sacrifice, an the&#xD;
hardy settlers had to mourn the fall of many brave and&#xD;
daring spirits.&#xD;
Two large fires kindled upon the point, sent dimly&#xD;
forth their cheering rays, struggling into and lighting up&#xD;
the cheerless darkness of night and forest shade ; and&#xD;
around these were now gathered the victors--the un-&#xD;
harmed and the wounded; whilst under tree and bush-2&#xD;
in coppice and dell, single and in heaps, were scattered&#xD;
around the unconscious dead.&#xD;
In stern grief,'the father sat alone and wept over the&#xD;
fate of his gallant son-the son mourned the gray hairs&#xD;
of his father, dabbled in blood-and the brother, as he&#xD;
recounted the fierce vengeance he had taken, dropped&#xD;
a tear to the memory of his bedmate and playfellow.&#xD;
But others still, who had neither father nor brother nor soti&#xD;
to mourn, broke the stillness of night and  eath, with&#xD;
laughter and shout and jest, and had no thought of the&#xD;
dangers through which they had so recently passed, or of&#xD;
the horrible and ghastly sight s hey had so lately wit-&#xD;
nessed. Such scenes to these werag common occurrence;&#xD;
they had often before beheldjust such sad sights; and&#xD;
their hearts were now dead and callous to blood and&#xD;
misery, and reckless alike of danger, and sorrow, and&#xD;
death. T e.may have had a passing thought of grief,&#xD;
and even  ed a hasty tear, at the first sight of some near&#xD;

OR, VOW FULFILLED.&#xD;
&#xD;
137&#xD;
&#xD;
neighbor, or old comrade in danger, lying stiff and cold&#xD;
in his bloody winding-sheet; but if so, that thought was&#xD;
soon driven away, and that tear soon dried up.; and now,&#xD;
if they thought at all, it was only to promise themselves,&#xD;
upon some future occasion, a fearful revenge, as if the.&#xD;
poor savage had nQt already made a sufficiently bloody&#xD;
atonement.&#xD;
Bryan, happy in the presence of his rescued wife and&#xD;
child, had already forgotten his recent grief and Aterror.&#xD;
He was now sitting by the light of the flaming fire, hold-&#xD;
ing his sleeping boy in his arms, and, with -Coma pressing&#xD;
close to his side, engaged with her in low, earnest con-&#xD;
versation; the latter, ever and anon, looking quickly and&#xD;
sh  .eringly around, as if. not yet entirely recovered&#xD;
fro her fright, or altogether satisfied of -her liberation&#xD;
from captivity, and safety from the dreaded Indians.&#xD;
The Sergeant and the good Mrs.iDuffe were close at hand,&#xD;
but looking easy and indifferent, as if nothing unusual had"  :&#xD;
happened; the former, from his -half-closed eye, and the&#xD;
manner in which his head drooped upon his bosom, giving&#xD;
evident token of the effect of weariness and want of sleep;&#xD;
whilst .the latter seemed in no way inclined to conversa-&#xD;
tion, or disposed to disturb the uneqsy rest of her hus-&#xD;
band.&#xD;
Old Titus,.however, made up for the silence and taci-&#xD;
turnity of the Sergeant and his wife. 'Surrounded by a&#xD;
little knot of wild young blades, he kept up an un-&#xD;
ceasing clatter; andif not then and there made out and&#xD;
proven to be a warrior of the first water, and fully entitled&#xD;

"Hi! hiI" laughed old Titus, by no means discomfited,&#xD;
"Massa Dick, you got dis nigger dat time."&#xD;
"Then you'11let us keep the scalps we've got ?" replied&#xD;
Dick, "and acknowledge that you did not, kill quite all&#xD;

deserve some little credit ?""&#xD;
"Gor'a mighty ! to be sure;" said-old Titus, ".dis nigger&#xD;
was jist. speaking figurmentively ; for he am only got&#xD;

A loud laugh greeted this sincere acknowledge  of&#xD;
,the black; and Devil ,Dick brought real tears into the&#xD;
,s of old Titus, and tears of laughter into the eyes of&#xD;
i  thoughtless comrades, by applying his hand to the&#xD;
wolly pate of the former, and testing, in no very gentle&#xD;
nanner, the foundation for his last assertion.&#xD;
By the bones of a buffalo bull, boys! old Titus has&#xD;
 told the truth this time," exclaimed Dick, "and -blast me&#xD;
ifghe#n'i got one palp fast enough. 'Twould make an&#xD;

"4Gor'a mighty, nassa Dick !"*replied old Titus, rubbing&#xD;
down his ruffled top-knot, "if she ain't' gone now, debil de&#xD;

Not many, paces distant from this merry crew,, but&#xD;
emingly totally unconscious of their merriment, and fre-&#xD;
quent-bursts'of unrestrained laughter, stood 'Kenton, lean-&#xD;

&#xD;
sions of passion and doubt, an observer, without the&#xD;
spirit of prophecy, could divine that a bitter struggle was&#xD;
then going on in his bosom. It was, indeed, a fierce con-&#xD;
'test between reason and passion-between justice and&#xD;
gratitude; and these doughty champions shivered many-,&#xD;
a lance in the honest borderer's heart, and held a bloody*&#xD;
tournament there, before either would -surrender the, field.&#xD;
But at length the baton fell; the field was won; and Pas-&#xD;
sion and Gratitude, as is too often the case in contests be-&#xD;
tween the mind and the heart, strode with bloody spur&#xD;
over the prostrate bodies of Reason and Justice. Raising&#xD;
his head, as if now determined, although hiscountetiance&#xD;
betokened no very great satisfaction at the result of the&#xD;
str le, the Scout, with a sigh, muttered: "'Tis settled&#xD;
no . I'll .do it." Then, as if again in doubt, he con-&#xD;
tinued: "'Tis a blasted shame :though, to set such a vil-&#xD;
lain loose ; but it can't be helped ; for no man shall say&#xD;
that Simon Kenton owed him a debt of gratitude and rep&#xD;
fused to pay. it. He desarves death a thousand times over,&#xD;
that's sartain; but I owe the bloody rascal a life, and, a&#xD;
life he shall have, though it cause a thousand deaths.&#xD;
Ay, Bang," added the Scout, somewhat sadly, as he head&#xD;
the low whine of his dog, who had been aroused from his&#xD;
slumbers by the sound of his master's voice'; 'tis assore&#xD;
trial, sure enough; but we can't help it now, and it mat&#xD;
be done. Blast me,. old fellow," he continued, looking&#xD;
into the eyes of his dog, "if I don't believe you know I&#xD;
ain't doing the right thing. But, may I never see the&#xD;

of my old=riIge, if I wouldn't rather a thousand. times that&#xD;

smaller fry politicians assent-to the will of their leaders,&#xD;
because he couldn't do anything else; the Scout, as if&#xD;
unwilling longer to continue the mental struggle, left his&#xD;
Ki   stationmby the tree, and, hurrying along as if not at all&#xD;
confident in the strength of his present purpose, strode&#xD;
hastily towards a small fire, around which were gathered&#xD;
some two or more hunters, guarding with sleepy indif-&#xD;
ference a well-secured prisoner. -Arriving at this fire,&#xD;
.Kenton told the sentinels, aroused from their listlessness&#xD;
by the sound of his approaching footsteps, that he would&#xD;
speak awhile with their prisoner, and that, for an hour or&#xD;
more, he would relieve them from duty. ToQ glad of&#xD;
any excuse to'snatch a moment. of rest after the severe&#xD;
fatigue of their rapid march, and restrained by near&#xD;
-of military discipline, theguards at once resigned eir&#xD;
place to Kenton, and, without raising an objection to the&#xD;
welcome change, hurried away.&#xD;
The two Simons now stood face to face. Simon the&#xD;
patriot, the famed borderer and contemporary of Boone,&#xD;
leaning upon his rifle, eyeing steadily and sternly the&#xD;
sullen and -ferocious countenance of Simon, the traitor&#xD;
and renegade ; and the latter, by no means daunted by&#xD;
his perilous position, or abashed by the scornful smile of&#xD;
the,:former, withreckless hardihood and indifference,&#xD;
turning look for look! Stunned by the blow of Head,'&#xD;
received in the commencement of the battle, Girty had&#xD;
recovered his life and consciousness -only to find himself&#xD;

his doomn for he neither hoped nor expectegercy at the&#xD;
ands of his captors! Wearied at lenigv it the silent&#xD;
and contemptuous scrutiny of Kenton therenegade with&#xD;
a motion of impatience, while a nocking and derisive&#xD;
smile flitted across -his hard featureexclaimed in a harsh&#xD;
singhered undertone-&#xD;
$imon Kent    is     . id; does he remember when&#xD;
th  dots would have burned him at the stake, and&#xD;
who it was that saved him from the tomahawk and&#xD;
torch ?".&#xD;
"If he ditdi't, he wouldn't now be here, and would jist&#xD;
&#xD;
leave Simon Girty, the traitor, to the doom he. so richly&#xD;
merits," replied the Scout, -sternly.&#xD;
"Simon Kenton is no doubt well pleased," said Girty,&#xD;
in the same mocking tone, "to find his old friend a prison-a&#xD;
er, and may-be is thinking now how be will reward past-&#xD;
kindness, by nobly aiding, on to-morrow, in swinging ups&#xD;
the traitor by his neck to some of these fine old trees,&#xD;
and leaving him there to hang like a dog, and be de-&#xD;
voured by the buzzards!"&#xD;
"The traitor and skulkin' leader of the bloody Shawa-&#xD;
nee desarves no better treatment," replied Kenton, bluntly.&#xD;
"Does the famed Scout of the Long-knife,"-said-Girty,&#xD;
in a taunting manner, ard unconsciously. adopting the&#xD;
sty  of his Indian allies, ''come to exult over the mis-&#xD;
forie of a man he dared not meet until his hands'and&#xD;
feet were secured by these cursed bonds?"&#xD;
"Simon Kenton has never yet seen the Indian or traitor&#xD;
that he dare not meet in open battle, in ambuscade, or&#xD;
lonely glade," replied the Scout, quickly; "and let Simon&#xD;
Girty but say that he will meet me hand to hand, with&#xD;
rifle or knife, and he .shall no longer remain a captive,&#xD;
for I'll out his bonds now, and lead him beyond the camp;&#xD;
and cuss me, if I don't thank him too, for the chance of&#xD;
thus wipin' off old scores, and at the same time wipin'&#xD;
out my own treachery."&#xD;
So deep an impression had the thought of setting the&#xD;
renegade loose, to prey again upon the community, made.&#xD;
upon the mind of Kenton, that he forgot that Girty was&#xD;
'still ignorant of his determination, and spoke of his own&#xD;
treachery -, if it had already been committed, and the&#xD;
prisoner w 4lyaware of his intentions. His preset&#xD;
proposition, ggested by the taunt of the captive, was&#xD;
joyfully seized upon, for he hoped that it would be ac-&#xD;
cepted, and he would thus have an opportunity of paying&#xD;
off his own: debt, and at the e time a chance of ward-&#xD;
ing off the civil consequence-  such a step, by ridding&#xD;
the community of so dangerous aniaenemy. Butiry&#xD;
had no such thought, and to the'eager proposal 'of the&#xD;
Scout, coldly replied-&#xD;

friend, not of shedding his blood; he made no conditions&#xD;
when he led him beyond the Indian camp, and bade him&#xD;
_go in safety!" ...&#xD;
"True1" exclaimed Kenton, striking his rifle heavily&#xD;
upon the ground, "but thar's a difference between Simon&#xD;
Kenton and Simon Girty  'Simon Kenton war' then a&#xD;

"I claim no kinfed or relationship with any my&#xD;

birth or color, I am by adoption, and at heart, an Indian!&#xD;
You did'not consider-it treachery," he added with a bitter&#xD;
sneer, "when I Turned against my friends and allies, and&#xD;
freed from bondage their most. determined and daring&#xD;
foe. But now, when the scene is changed, and instead of&#xD;
Simon Kenton bound to the stake, to be tortured with&#xD;
the rising .sun, it is Simon Girty ;who is the captive, to&#xD;
be hung by the. neck like a thieving dQg with to-morrow's&#xD;
sight, Simon Kenton chooses to think otherwise, and&#xD;
talks of trials and treachery, and would fain , forget the&#xD;
past, leaving him who once saved his life to death, and&#xD;
the fierce-anger of unforgiving enemies ! Ha! ha!" laughed&#xD;
the outlaw, with scoffing bitterness, "but what more could&#xD;
J expect from my Christian brethren?       rick of&#xD;
theirs to repay kindness with hatred, an  er become&#xD;
an enemy, than bear the burden of gr   I"4&#xD;
"You are no Indian, Simon Girgybut, in spite of all&#xD;
yoiz say, nothing' more nor less thanbase traitor to your&#xD;
o    people," replied th  cout, sternly. "You have led&#xD;
the murdering" savage t6 ill and scalp helpless women&#xD;
and children; and for this desarve to be hung up lip# a&#xD;
skulking' wolf, and without pity; but that you saved my&#xD;
life once I'll not deny; and to pay off that debt, and be'&#xD;
even with you, I am now here; though blast me if..I&#xD;
&#xD;
wouldn't jist as soon turn a half-starved wolf into a sheep-&#xD;
pen, as to let .you go, to agin lead your scalpin' thieves&#xD;
again the settlements! "&#xD;
"I am glad to find that my' old comrade has not for-  V&#xD;
gotten the past, and has still a kindly feeling ?or an old&#xD;
friend," replied Girty, his face.brightening up at the pro-&#xD;
spect of safety he-d out by Kenton, and speaking now in&#xD;
a more conciliatory tone, than he had -yet seen proper to&#xD;
adopt.-&#xD;
"Thar you are mistaken agin," said the Scout, quickly,&#xD;
meeting Girty's attempt at conciliation with undisguised&#xD;
contempt. "I've not forgotten' that you once saved my&#xD;
life, but as for having' any kindly felin' or friendship for&#xD;
you, 4hain't ,none tall 1 I loathe you as:I do the rattle-&#xD;

mine, if we ever meet again,' Simon Girty, remember we&#xD;
meet as deadly foes, with no gratitude on either side, for&#xD;
we've returned life for life, and are now even."&#xD;
"As you will !" muttered the renegade, sullenly,-"for&#xD;
I have no love for any of you, and would as soon have&#xD;
your hatred as friendship ! You'll not find me backward,&#xD;
rest assured of that; for I'll not hesitate to take your life,&#xD;
should we ever meet again! Simon Girty will not soon&#xD;

"I wouldn't have you backward, nor would I have&#xD;

matters little with me, since I've already revenged my.&#xD;
self for past injuries upon the hated race you would have&#xD;
tae love, and care not for death, though I would gladly&#xD;
complete my revenge upon the son of my old enemy,&#xD;
which I would have done, had not the fates been against-&#xD;
me, and them damned savages .permitted themselves to&#xD;
be surprised and the. boats taken ! How your hunters&#xD;
learned there were canoes upon the river, and were led to&#xD;
lay this trap for the Shawanees, is beyond my knowledge."&#xD;
'Easy enough !" replied the Scout to this half inquiry&#xD;
of the renegade, "for I was on the trail when you sur-&#xD;
prised this 'ere Frenchran, and followed you to the- cave ;&#xD;
I saw your canoesand jist guessed your design: I&#xD;
alarmed the settlements, sent word to the Vienna sgtion&#xD;
to be on the alert, and, with the same company that de-&#xD;
feated you this evening, made a forced-march to surprise&#xD;
you at the cave, but were a few hours too late for that,&#xD;
though fast enough to catch you here and scalp. every red&#xD;
devil of a Shawanee that had crossed the river. You&#xD;
foiled me once in the old State with your red wig, when&#xD;
you and that ar" darned Frenchman wer' at some ,of your&#xD;
deviltry, but out here in the woods and on the scout, it&#xD;
takes a smarter man than Simon Girty to throw dust in&#xD;
the eyes of Simon Kenton! 'But tell me, now ?"inquired&#xD;
Kenton, showing some anxiety, "if this 'ere blasted Cap-&#xD;
tain had anything to do with your attack upon the station&#xD;
of Mr. Bryan and the Sargeant ?"&#xD;
A gleam of low cunning, and somewhat exultant, flit-&#xD;
ted across the-'countenance of the renegade at this ques-&#xD;
tion of the-Scout; but, after a moment of. ieiit thought,&#xD;
he only answered it by coolly inquiri g4&#xD;
"Did the Captain escape, and is he alive and free?"&#xD;
" To be sure he is," replied Kenton; "though cuss me if&#xD;
I have 'any faith in his smooth:words, for he's got nigger&#xD;
blood in his veins, and ggn't be trusted."&#xD;
"You- s w him when he dwas taken captive by the&#xD;
Shawanees," said Girty, "and hknow me well enough to&#xD;
belieti that I need no assistance or persuasion when'upon&#xD;
the trail of an enemy "&#xD;
"T.know you wll enough to believe you guilty of any&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, VOW FULFILLED.&#xD;
&#xD;
x45&#xD;
&#xD;
sort of rascality," replied the Scout, bluntly; -"yet, blast&#xD;
me, if I don't still b'lieve that darned Captain had some-&#xD;
thing to do with the carrying off of Miss Coma, and would&#xD;
like plaguy well to know."&#xD;
" Which you will never learn from me," replied Girty,&#xD;
doggedly; "and now, if you intend to fulfil your promise,&#xD;
and set me free, doq so .t once, for thes9 bonds are any-&#xD;
thing but pleasant; and if you would have me escape, I&#xD;
must put a long trail between myself and your iharp-&#xD;
eyed scouts, before the light of the cordng day.&#xD;
Stepping- forward, Kenton, with the assistance of his&#xD;
hunting-knifeg soon.severed the cords from the renegade's&#xD;
hands and feet; but as the latter made a motion to shake&#xD;
off the now useless bonds, the Scout'exclaimed, sterly-&#xD;
"Let them remain, and stand whar' you'are; for you&#xD;
shan't fly till the return of:your guard."&#xD;
"A strange way of paying off the debt of gratitude&#xD;
you owe me," said Girty, sneeringly.; "for of what use&#xD;
will it be to me to know that my hands and feet are free,&#xD;
when with the first motion I make, your fellows will-send&#xD;
a bullet through me? -Simon Girty did not thus leave Si-&#xD;
mon Kenton when he was in the hands of the Wyandot."&#xD;
"Your escape will be easy enough !" eplied Kenton,&#xD;
"for the sentinels are worn down by fatigue and want of&#xD;
sleep;.and believing you securely bound, it ion't be long&#xD;
before you may walk off without danger or hindrance.";&#xD;
"But if I go without gun or arms of any kind," said&#xD;
Girty, "e'Ven if I should escape the pursuit of your.com-&#xD;
rades,who will be upQn my trail with the dawn of day,&#xD;
I will only escape to die a miserable death by starvation.&#xD;
If such e;your kindness, Simon Kenton, I'll remain&#xD;
here and die, for I would rather fall by the bullet or&#xD;
knife, and die at once, than perish thus by piecemeal.&#xD;
When Igave you yorur.life?' added the renegade, once&#xD;
more referring to the past, for he well knew the soft point&#xD;
in the Scout's heart,sand here to. touch to gain his end,&#xD;
" I also furnished you with the means of support and de-&#xD;

=miserably' perishing at the stake."&#xD;
"I'll owe you-nothin', Simon Girty," said Kenton, after&#xD;
a mnente's deliberation, "for I won't deny that you once&#xD;
toodbey friend, aA'dnow that JFve promised, you may jist&#xD;
rest-satisfied; for 'I'11 faurnish you with everything neces-&#xD;

food; and then if you don't make good your escape the&#xD;

Girty proffered his hand, and would have returned his&#xD;
thanks; but Kenton, refusing the first, quickly inter-&#xD;
rupted him, exclaiming, sternly--&#xD;
I1 take no traitor by the hand, and desarve none of&#xD;

we meet,. there'll be no old score of kindness to wipe&#xD;

The renegade made no reply, only regarding the Scout&#xD;
with a -scowl of deadly. malice, which the latter noticing&#xD;
as he turned away, answered with a smile of quiet con-&#xD;

CHAP/IER XII.&#xD;
ONCE more Coma satinher loved "winter lodge." It&#xD;
may have been a week, or' even more since the wild&#xD;
scenes described in our last chapter; and to have seen&#xD;
her now, with all the savage ornaments of 'her room re-&#xD;
arranged, with her boy sleeping pleasantly in is cradle,&#xD;
and herself sitting lovingly t the feet of her husband,&#xD;
no one would have imagined that the storm of Indian&#xD;
war had so lately passed over that quiet household,,.or&#xD;
that the lovely and tender being before him had so re-&#xD;
cently been a captive in the hands of the Shawanee.&#xD;
Yet such had been the case ;-but.these scenes were com-&#xD;
mon in the earlier settlements of Kentucky; and though&#xD;
they created much alarm at the time in the immediate&#xD;
vicinity of the outrage, when once happily terminated,&#xD;
they were soon forgotten by the neighbors, and made al-&#xD;
most as slight an impression upon the minds of the par-&#xD;
ties directly concerned.&#xD;
The hardy pioneers, never free from danger, had be-&#xD;
come somewhat accustomed to the bloody excursions of&#xD;
the savage;kand rapid devastating inroads, like the one&#xD;
that had just taken place,,*were expected as a matter of&#xD;
course, and ies.were only too glad to escape so easily,&#xD;
more especially when they had been so successful in pun-&#xD;
ishing the enemy.&#xD;
Mrs. Duffe had returned to her home and usual rxpaoy-&#xD;
ments with scarcely a thought, or at any rate  ut a&#xD;
word respecting her late danger and escape tho&#xD;
are compelled i truth to say that she rec&#xD;

&#xD;
brave defense of the station, and the business-like man-&#xD;
ner in which, with the assistance of Titus, she had dis-&#xD;
patched the Indian warrior.   q&#xD;
"I hope I did r'gt4 was .her quiet response, the first&#xD;
time it was-mentio.  "for if I had not killed the Indian,&#xD;
he would have scalpedTitus, and may-be all of us."&#xD;
"Gora'mighty, Miss. Sally, what make you say dat !"&#xD;
exclaimed the black, thinking his own warlike abilities&#xD;
ewhat lessenedby this confession of his mistress;&#xD;
-he no take my scalp; for. dis nigger had him tight&#xD;
enough,- and jist call on you to split him's head; case him&#xD;
thought you'd like to do it. Bi'ne.by de red thief would&#xD;
dame tired out, den dis child would riz, and 0 golly, how&#xD;
he'dbunged him's eyes! Gora'mighty! him couldn't see&#xD;
sunshine when I'ze done wid him."&#xD;
The Sergeant's wife was.too good-natured, and liked&#xD;
the honest black too much to say anything in opposition&#xD;
to this boast of his manhood, and chose rather to labor&#xD;
under the charge of unnecessarily shedding the blood of&#xD;
the savage, than tell the exact situation of Titus when he&#xD;
clainied her assistance, and called upon ler for rescue.&#xD;
She was satisfied, in her own heart, of full justification,&#xD;
from necessity and the, extreme urgency of the case ; and,&#xD;
as .she had no thought of becoming a heroine, or claim-&#xD;
ing the scalp as atrophy of her prowess, permitted Titus&#xD;
ti"have it all his own way; not even whispering to the&#xD;
Sergeant himself, the certainty oft the black's defeat, had&#xD;
she not settled the contest by appealing to the axe.&#xD;
It was not so,.however, with Coma; for, raised delicately&#xD;
as she had been, and totally unused to danger'and un-&#xD;
familiar with bloody sights, it took many'days, and all&#xD;
the soothing, cpiieting arguments of herwhusband and his&#xD;
devoted friends to drive away her terror, and bring the&#xD;
roses bgkto her pale cheek. But, settled down in her&#xD;
home    Aand everything around her looking as quiet,&#xD;
comf  able,;and safe as before the attack of the Indians,&#xD;
s    onresumed her cheerfulness, and could even speak&#xD;
o ft   read scenes she had witnessed in a steady tone,&#xD;
*ti&amp;amp;Agh not without a passing shudder, and now and then&#xD;
&#xD;
a snow cloud settling upon her countenance to drive away&#xD;
its roses.&#xD;
As we have. already said, it was some week' or more&#xD;
after the defeat of the Indians, and Coma sat before a&#xD;
ruddy fire upon a low stool," at -the feet of her hus-&#xD;
band, and in her own room, decorated with barbaric mag-&#xD;
nificence, and made not only comfortable, but really sin-&#xD;
gularly tasteful, by the united -efforts of herself, her&#xD;
husband, and the Sergeant.&#xD;
"Your thoughts -are troublesome, and your dream&#xD;
anything but pleasing,.dear Bryan," said the wife, look-&#xD;
ing up confidingly into the face of her husband, "if I&#xD;
may judge by the cloud upon your brow, and your long&#xD;
silence. Take Coma into your confidence," she added,&#xD;
with a smile, "for if a sad -child in the presence of dan-&#xD;
ger, you will find her a woman and a wife in the hour of&#xD;
sorrow and trouble; and if she cannot drive away your&#xD;
heavy thoughts, she will at -least sympathize with 'you,&#xD;
and thus share the burden."&#xD;
Head had been sitting for some time seemingly uncon-&#xD;
scious of the presence of his wife, looking thoughtfully,&#xD;
and with a somewhat sad expression of countenance, into&#xD;
the cheerful fire, as men frequently do when in a musing&#xD;
mood, or engaged in castle-building, or some one of the&#xD;
many vagaries of thc busy mind ; but at the sound-of&#xD;
Coma's low sweet voice, his reverie was broken, and the&#xD;
tinge of melancholy, but a moment since so apparent&#xD;
upon his speaking features, was swept away at'once by a&#xD;
beaming smile of love,' and, leaning down, he kissed the&#xD;
fair brow of the speaker, replying-&#xD;
"My heart is thine, Coma, and with thee will I share&#xD;
every thought, even to the wildest vagaries of my&#xD;
shadowy indefinable musings."&#xD;
"What dark spirit, theriwas at work upon your heart&#xD;
but a moment ago, to make those naughty furrows upon&#xD;
your brow, and place that heavy cloud upon your face?&#xD;
If Coma is to share your tbeghts, she would also share&#xD;
your sorrows; and sad revIeia you must have ad, for&#xD;
a Wife's eye cannot be mistaken when she is reading the&#xD;
countenance of her husband."&#xD;

the husband, jestingly; ."and many who consider them-&#xD;

#ften find themselves wofully deceived. - A smile' does&#xD;
ot aways betoken: pleasure, nor-does a tear always sig-&#xD;
if  sorrow; and a: gay heart is often found under a&#xD;
thoughtful face, whilst many a sad one weeps beneath a&#xD;
beaiing smile."'&#xD;
The world may be deceived, and a casual observer,&#xD;
studying the face of a stranger, may at times be wrong,"&#xD;
replied Coma; ";but betweese husband and wife, and be-&#xD;
tween kindred, sympathizing hearts, this book you, speak&#xD;

"Nor will I scnceal anything from you," said 'the hus-&#xD;
band, laying his hand upon the dark ringlets of his wife,&#xD;
and looking kindly into her upturned face; ."but why&#xD;
burden your heart, dear Coma with mere:fncied dan&#xD;

" To a wife," was the eager answer of Coma, "it is no&#xD;
'burden;or,,if so, a pleasing one, to share the troubles of-&#xD;
her husband, be they real orimaginary.""&#xD;
"Thei'be it so," exclaimed Head, fondly, "for I can&#xD;

thoughts were of death ; and shadowy .gigantic sorrows&#xD;
came looming up in the distance like the gathering fog&#xD;
upon the mountain-top, until all was lost in darkness and&#xD;
gloom. Why it is I cannot tell, for I fear him not, but&#xD;
I can never think of this smiling, plotting Captant Jean,&#xD;
without a shudder. In spite of all my efforts to the con-&#xD;
tra'ry, I aim ever thinking' his presence in this country&#xD;
bodes us no good, and Kenton fully believes, notwith-&#xD;
standing his plausible story, that your cousin was in&#xD;

his savages to attack our "station 'and carry you ofd "a&#xD;

"He is base enough'to be 'guilty of' any crime," ex-&#xD;

thoughts and fears, ever since his smiling face and soft&#xD;
'tongue, more loathsome than -the fierce savage, startled&#xD;
me, uponmy weary path, and 'made my dreary captivity&#xD;
still more horrible.. What motive could have induced&#xD;
'him to leave t r ease- and comfort of my father's house,&#xD;

lost the one, but gained the other,; and what more does&#xD;
he now wish? If he has any fears of my disturbing&#xD;
him in hi ill-gained wealth, he may go in peace, for I&#xD;
will never receive the fortune of my father, great as. it is,&#xD;
if.I had, to take it with his curse still upon me ! 'Tis&#xD;
strange that. my father, who once loved me so well, should&#xD;
so long continue obdurate and hard-hearted towards his&#xD;
child, and. merely because she clung. to him she loved,&#xD;
rather than take the hand of one she despised, and one&#xD;
sQ unworthy of esteem or affection."&#xD;
"But, remember, dear. Coma," said Head, wishing to&#xD;
sdothe the feelings of his wife,.and soften down, if pos-&#xD;
sible, 'the harsh and cruel treatment she had received&#xD;
from her parent, "your father thought quite differently,&#xD;
for. this Captain Jean had full possession of his ear, and,&#xD;
I might add, esteem and affection ; while, on the other&#xD;
hand, he was induced to. believe me all that was mean&#xD;
and contemptible, and, by the -base perjury of Captain&#xD;
Montlack, a miserable felon 1" '&#xD;
"aut was I not his own daughter," his own flesh and.&#xD;
blood ?" replied Coma," and had I not ever been a loving&#xD;
child, and did I 'net tell himof the baseness and treachery&#xD;
of his false kinsman? andy1iR he believed me not, but&#xD;
willingly bent his. ear tou the lying tongue of Captain&#xD;
Jean, cruelly jesting with my feelings, and to my earnest&#xD;
prayers retorting that my hatred to his kinsman, was the&#xD;
result of shameful and mnisplaced love for a base-born&#xD;
traitor's son. I was .his daughter, and, notwithstanding&#xD;
his sometimes cold and proud mien, had loved him well;&#xD;
but his haughty, contemptuous look, and bitter, unigene-&#xD;
rous words upon that occasion, did much to chill the&#xD;
warm gushings of my heart, and tore away many of the&#xD;
golden cgrds binding.me, the child, to him, my father."&#xD;
"He was proud, very proud of his ancient name and&#xD;
lineage," said Head, stG1p indly endeavoring to make the&#xD;
cruel trgatment of her father, and; his subsequent obdu-&#xD;
racy and forgetfulness, appear:dn the fairest light possi-.&#xD;
ble, "and his pride made him not only unjust to thee,&#xD;
Cin4.gbut led him to treat with contempt. every charge&#xD;
fine against his -kinsman, and blindly believe the false-&#xD;
&#xD;
hoods of this same treacherous relation. But cheer upt&#xD;
dear Coma, for the hypocrite, though successful ford&#xD;
time, cannot always wear his cloaking garb, an~d sooner'&#xD;
'or later, will stand forth in all his deformity, stripped, of&#xD;
his borrowed'plumes, and hated   and scorned by him he&#xD;
has deceived.. The hour will ret come, never fear, when&#xD;
your father, undeceived and unswayed by the plausible&#xD;
tongue of Captain Jean, will repent his harshness to his&#xD;
daughter, and once more 'fold herin love to his bosom."&#xD;
The hypocrite had already been discovered, and the&#xD;
hour of repentance had already come; but the father will&#xD;
never again look upon the fair brow of his daughter, or&#xD;
the daughter upon the loed face of her parent. They&#xD;
had parted in ahger-the parent and child-and both had&#xD;
much to forget and forgive; but he now slumbered with&#xD;
the silent dead, and the last lines traced by a feeble hand,&#xD;
making known his repentance, and pouring out his for-&#xD;
giveness, were unread by the eyes for which they were&#xD;
intended, and safe in the possession of the base kinsman;&#xD;
while she,'ignorant of her father's fate, and still believing&#xD;
him obdurate, and cruel, and unjust wondered athilong&#xD;

and wept, and could oily murmur--&#xD;
"God grant'that 'it may be so ; for I mould not have&#xD;

many sad recollections, so unexpectedly startles my ear.&#xD;
And oh! what a dark smile of "triumph flitted across his&#xD;
face,',when I asked of my father; and: thechypocrite, in&#xD;
spite of all his endeavors to appear kind and forgetful of&#xD;

black, and his designs are evil; but I cannot;imagine any&#xD;
reasonable motive, either of hatred or interest, to induce his&#xD;
present inexplicable journey to this -dangerous country."&#xD;
"The mind of the pure and artless is often at a loss to&#xD;
unravel the dark and mysterious windings of wickedness;&#xD;
but a thousand motives' and inducements to crime are&#xD;
ever at work in the breast of the corrupt; and it is only&#xD;
from mingling withsuch, and following' up their tortuous&#xD;

wicked are never at aloss for a motive for any species of&#xD;

&#xD;
not be muchtroubled to find a hundred causes for hatred&#xD;
to me. But be ngt alarmed; for, knowing him as I'dQ,&#xD;
and suspecting treachery in his blandest smiles, he can-&#xD;
not deceive me;,and I have no- fears, although," added&#xD;
Head, somewhat thoughtfully, "he has already become&#xD;
intimate with that dark-browed, sullen Malden, the only&#xD;
enemy I have in the country."&#xD;
"My husband is entirely too flattering," replied Coma,&#xD;
with a well-pleased look; for what woman-be she wife,&#xD;
maid, or widow; and we might add with equal 'truth,&#xD;
what man-be he husband, bachelor, or widower-is&#xD;
not fond of flattery? "and need never think the loss of&#xD;
my poor self a sufficient -cause to arouse the hatred&#xD;
of -Captain Jean; but while he. has so many other causes&#xD;
for malice, beware of him, dear Bryan; for a coward&#xD;
is ever to -be more dreaded than a brave man; since&#xD;
the first will strike you in the dark, and without a warn-&#xD;
ing ; while the latter, too noble to be an assassin, will give&#xD;
you notice, and a fair chance for life."&#xD;
"Never fear!" said Head, cheerfully, and fondly return-&#xD;
ing the affectionate look of his wife, as he toyed With a&#xD;
straggling curl, "I have too much to live for, to die with-&#xD;
out a struggle; and will not h aught napping, with the-&#xD;
prowling foe upon my trail. But away with these melan-&#xD;
choly forebodings, Coma ! for they are but the shadowy&#xD;
creations of a fit of musing, and there-is in reality no&#xD;
danger, and nothing to fear from captain Montlack. We&#xD;
have. no laws here, and no flattering, partial judges to&#xD;
become the engine and tools of the rich man's malice.&#xD;
The strong arm and brave heart is the only law we ac-&#xD;
knowledge in this country, and they fill the place of&#xD;
judge, law, and executioner; either to defend or punisiC&#xD;
Captain Jean will appeal to neither of these, and must&#xD;
return to the old State, where money may-buy, and&#xD;
wealth surround him with fawning sycophants, before&#xD;
his hatred may be feared or his anger prove dangerous."&#xD;
"You may be right,"said Coma, doubtingly, and by&#xD;
no means convinced by the iMold and -fearless tones of&#xD;
her husband, "and our fears may all be groundless, and&#xD;
without reality ; but remember, that money isall-power-&#xD;

The inmates of the other room of the station had also&#xD;
been engaged in busy conversation around the fireside of&#xD;
the Sergeant; and the meeting on to-morrow, at Hplding's,&#xD;
having suggested the presence of Montlack in the neigh-&#xD;
borhood, the Scout and his more taciturn companion had&#xD;
not spared the character of Monsieur Jean, but, to judge&#xD;
from the language of Sinion, had come to a similar con-&#xD;
ncusionw with Head and his wife, and were by no means&#xD;
satisfied with the Captain's journey West.&#xD;
r-        "He ain't to be trusted nohow," said Kenton,4as if to&#xD;
drive the nail home and'-settle their doubts at once; "for&#xD;

" How so " inquired Kenton; for the black's 1l be-&#xD;
tokened a story; and the Scout, knowing his propensity&#xD;
for yarning, was more than willing to humor him.&#xD;
"Long time ago," said Titus, as if thus to excuse huim&#xD;
self, "when 'dis old chunk be one berry little house-boy&#xD;

and blacks, and has no influence over mongrels. Mu-.&#xD;
lattoes are'auew race, of recent creation, unknown to the&#xD;
ancients, and which the gods had no hand in fashioning."&#xD;
"It wern't Cupid," said Titus, innocently, thinking the&#xD;
Sergeant spoke of an old fellow-servant of that name,&#xD;
"but a dam mulatter rascal dey called Pumpeyfp dat turned&#xD;
de gal's head; and may-be I didnt gib him particular&#xD;
goss, when I found de ting out 1"&#xD;
"Sarved him right !" exclaimed Simon, a flash of merry&#xD;
humor sparking in his eye; "and that's jist the way we&#xD;
should treat all these sneakin' half-bloods. It wer' bad&#xD;
enough to steal your sweetheart ; but a darned sight&#xD;
worse to steal her after she'd got all your money."&#xD;
"Zactly," said Titus, with all the gravity of a sage&#xD;
counsellor'of state; "and dat's de way dis child consider-&#xD;
ated de ting, when he dibed into, de 'fections of Mister&#xD;

"And the yaller beauty, what became of her?" said&#xD;
Simon.&#xD;
" Q, Gora'mighty !" exclaimed Titus, showing the white&#xD;
of his eyes, with the burlesque tragic air of a modern&#xD;
stage lover; "she jist marry dat dam Pompey, and what&#xD;
you tink, didn't axe dis child to de wedding! "&#xD;
" The unkindest cut of all," said the Sergeant, scarce&#xD;
able to restrain his merriment; "but I 'spose, Titus, you&#xD;
treated this slight with silent contempt ?"&#xD;
"Sure I did! for I jist gib Mister Pompey1de most&#xD;
considerable lickin' he eber got in all him's borgfdays;&#xD;
and what's more, made him promise neber to marry de&#xD;
gal Gain,widout axing die darkey to de weddin'."&#xD;
A safe promise that, which I guess even a mulatto&#xD;
couldn't break,'? replied the Sergeant, laughing heartily&#xD;
at the black's notions of "silent contemipt.". "But come,&#xD;
Simon !" he added, turning to the Scou, whose huge sides&#xD;
were still shaking with merriment ; "as you start so early&#xD;
in the morriig, it is time you were asleep.".&#xD;
"I slept last night, and the night before, and it makes&#xD;
little difference with me, whether I sleep agin for a week,"&#xD;
said the Scout. "To tell you the truth, Sargeant, this&#xD;

Bang! I 'spose we must do it; for Miss Sally," he added,&#xD;
with a. nod at the Sergeant's wife, "is- a straight up and&#xD;
down sort of woman, and hangs out for rigular hours.&#xD;
I'll jist take   peep at the weather, Sargeant, and then&#xD;
shake down for the night."&#xD;
Titus had already "shook down," and,' if allowed to&#xD;
judge from his very effective efforts at snoring, was giving&#xD;
sleep what he gave Pompey, a terrible "lickin';" but at&#xD;
the same time, by no means treating old Somnus with&#xD;
"silent contempt."&#xD;
Men often become a prey to melancholy forebodings,&#xD;
and without any tangible cause or known reason. Faint&#xD;
shadowings of evil hang around and oppress them, tinging&#xD;
all their thoughts with sadness; and, in spite of every&#xD;
effort to throw off this waking nightmare, it continues.to&#xD;
increase and strengthen with every struggle, until in some&#xD;
instances the unhappy victim has been known to perish,&#xD;
under the dread influence of an imagination thus diseased.&#xD;
We read of animals and even insects, that by instinct&#xD;
know the presence of an enemy, and without farther&#xD;
warning hurry to avoid the approaching danger. We&#xD;
see no reason, then, why men should not be gifted with&#xD;
this same instinctive knowledge of evil; and why, when&#xD;
oppressed with gloomy foreshadowings of danger, they&#xD;
do not use every precaution, to ward off the threatened&#xD;
injury. The presence of Montlack, like the rattle of the&#xD;
lurking snake, had excited in the minds, not only of&#xD;
Bryan and Coma, but of Duffe and the Scout, strong&#xD;
forebodings of evil. Nor were their fears aroused with-&#xD;
out a sufficient cause;.for Captain Jean, although appa-&#xD;
rently repentant of past misdeeds, and to aU apearance&#xD;
without any injurious design whatever,     tly pre=&#xD;

Heaven.&#xD;
CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
MAJOR MALDEN, Dick Dobbins, or' as he was more com-&#xD;
nonly called by his companions, Devil-Dick, along with&#xD;
some eight or tenothers, and among these, Captain Jean,&#xD;
were gathered around a rough slab table in the house of&#xD;
Colonel Holding. They had met, by request of the host,&#xD;
to talk over the affairs of the colony, and _unite upon&#xD;
some plan best to resist the inroads' of the savage, and&#xD;
meet any future attack; but, before entering upon this&#xD;
very necessary duty, they had concluded, and, no doubt,&#xD;
Yery wisely, for men cannot give good advice or counsel&#xD;
upon an empty stomach,iirst to appease the calls of appe-&#xD;
the, and'thus render themselves subject, alone, to the calls&#xD;
oQf Patriotism-&#xD;
t   s late for dinner at that period, in the history of&#xD;
Kentucky, when the appetite was-consulted rather than&#xD;
fashion; but we may account for the Colonel's uninten-&#xD;
tional fashionable hour of dining by saying that the&#xD;
days were then rather short, cooking by no means a tri-&#xD;
fling job, when pots and kettles and cooking-stoves were&#xD;
things unknown and unheard of, and the hospitable host&#xD;
having waited to a late hour the arrival of his expected&#xD;
guests, this meal was intended to answer both for din-&#xD;
ner and supper, and was, therefore, veryhumanely served&#xD;
up at a medium period between the two.&#xD;
The garniture of the table would&amp;amp;not have invited the&#xD;
attack of robber or burglar; for, although the Colonel&#xD;
had been accustomed to better things in the old State,&#xD;
and had mingled, in his youthin good society, he neither&#xD;
had; or could get, the usual or common comforts of civili-&#xD;
zation out in his new home in the West, and was, there-&#xD;
Lore, compelled to setout his table with the common fur-&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, VOW FULFILLED.&#xD;
&#xD;
niture of the country, to wit: wooden bowls and platte&#xD;
for the leading dishes, and clean pieces of fresh bark&#xD;
plates, his guests using their hunting-knives both for kill-&#xD;
ing Indians and cutting up their food.&#xD;
But, at the time when we introduce this party to the&#xD;
reader, they seemed-to judge from their satisfied looks,&#xD;
and the riddled haunch of venison, surrounded by its&#xD;
attendant dishes of bear meat and wild fowl all exhibit-&#xD;
ing evident traces of a recent heavy attack--to have pretty&#xD;
well satisfied their hunger; and were then on the eve of&#xD;
paying their respects to a pail of whiskey toddy;. for a&#xD;
bucket of that much esteemed -liquor, a rare luxury at&#xD;
that early day, and by, no means -as common then as&#xD;
at the present time, stood temptingly in the centre of the&#xD;
table, with sundry gourds hnd tin cups arranged conve-&#xD;
niently in and around it, ready to supply the demands of&#xD;
these by no means choice gourmands.&#xD;
These were times when the rich, enjoyed very few more&#xD;
comfort than the poor; and luxuries, if there were any&#xD;
such articles-at that day, which, from.the, best authority,&#xD;
we are disposed to doubt,, were the result, alone, of the&#xD;
individual genius and labor of the possessor. We can&#xD;
but smile when we think of the rough fare and furniture&#xD;
of the cabin ,of the pioneer, and then look around us at&#xD;
the pomp and luxury, and gaudy trappings of a modern,&#xD;
establishment. The fathers battled and toiled, and, with&#xD;
careless indifference, endured every species of danger and&#xD;
hardship that their children might live at ease, and enjoy&#xD;
the fruits of their labor. Philosophers, laugh, and are&#xD;
disposed to sneer, when they speak of the past; and ask&#xD;
what the effeminate children of the present day would do&#xD;

THE WINTER LODGE;&#xD;
&#xD;
of the age of which we are speaking. ,Men are but the&#xD;
Features of time and surrounding circumstance; .and I&#xD;
care not what may be the emergency, you will always&#xD;
find ready spirits tomeet, and, if necessary, conquer'every&#xD;
difficulty. But little over a half centuryhas passed since&#xD;
the savage and semi-civilized hunter met in bloody battle,&#xD;
contending for the possession of the fertile plains, now&#xD;
constituting the State of Kentucky; and behold already&#xD;
the vast change ! The bark lodge. of the Indian gave&#xD;
place to the humble and ungainly cabin of the early. set-&#xD;
tiler; and now those cabins, once the abodes of health&#xD;
and hardy border comfort, have' sunk beneath the touch&#xD;
of time and reform,. and become a.par) of mother.earth&#xD;
again; while instead thereof, you find only lordly palaces&#xD;
of brick and mortar. The children of the cabin have be'-&#xD;
come the masters of the palace; and many of those, for&#xD;
many of them are still alive, who once thought no bed.&#xD;
more pleasant or comfortable than a blanket or buffalo&#xD;
hide upon the puncheon floor or greensward, now rest&#xD;
uneasily upon a couch of:down, and complain of'a bed of&#xD;
lign and feathers. Such has beenthe effect of progress&#xD;
ad refinement, or, as men are .pleased to call it, civiliza--&#xD;
tion. But a short time back, we met with a laughable&#xD;
but at the same time most striking illustration of this&#xD;
wonderful change in .men and things, in a chance ren-&#xD;
counter between two of these old pioneers, each. repre-&#xD;
senting in their -persons, the striking characteristics of&#xD;
which we have just been, speaking. They had been bogs&#xD;
together in the early occupation of Kentucky, an4Were&#xD;
splendid specimens; notwithstanding their age,, oanly.&#xD;
strength and activity; but while one represented, in his&#xD;
bluff and unpolished person, a striking picture. of the half&#xD;
civilized pioneer; the other, having mingled. in society,&#xD;
and paid some attention to the cultivation of his mind,&#xD;
shadowed forth, in his proud b ing and language, the&#xD;
pioneer, refined and remodelle  te plastic touch of&#xD;
wealth and civilization. Theforr1 a'plain tiller of the&#xD;
soil was delighted to.speak of'the trying days of the early&#xD;
ments; and did no'hesitate, upon any0occasion, to&#xD;
tell 'fthe poveity ofhis paknts,' and of the trying shifts&#xD;
&#xD;
they were. put to in their log cabin in the wilderness;&#xD;
while the latter cared not to revert to these early scenes,&#xD;
and -preferred rather to speak -of the present, boast-.&#xD;
ing, for a republican, very loudly of station and family.&#xD;
Knowing the soft point in his friend's character, after a&#xD;
warm and cordial shake of the hand, the old pioneer, in&#xD;
his usual bluff, off-hand manner, exclaimed-&#xD;
"Well, Andrew, do you remember when-we were boys&#xD;
together, and drank sassafras' tea from gourd cups, and&#xD;
without sweetening?"&#xD;
"Yes," said the other, doggedly, glancing uneasily&#xD;
around at the company."&#xD;
".And when your parents and mine,,with their twelve&#xD;
children, all lived inthe same little cabin, fifteen by twenty,&#xD;
on the banks of Green River, and slept on bear skins and&#xD;
buffalo hides, and never once heard tell of sugar and cof-&#xD;
fee, and feather beds, and such like? do you' still remem-&#xD;
ber those times ?"&#xD;
"Yes, damn you!" said the other, with some heat, be-&#xD;
coming enraged at the reminiscence; but thinkingto get&#xD;
ahead of his tormentor, and' close his mouth atonce and&#xD;
forever, continued in a loud voice, "and do you remeam-&#xD;
her, John, of what material your-mamma's shift was made,&#xD;
when we lived in that same cai??"&#xD;
"Buckskin," said the other, coolly.&#xD;
"And what your sister's ?"&#xD;
noksking" was the second reply, with equal prompti-&#xD;
4 what your father's shirt?"&#xD;
"'And what. your's?"&#xD;
"Buckskin again," replied the other, with 'a laugh;&#xD;
"and I hope you hadn't forgotten, Andrew, how I used&#xD;
to wipe your nose with the tail of it."&#xD;
A roar of merrinaint greeted this unlooked-for ex.&#xD;
posure, under cover of 'Which, Andrew beat his retreat,&#xD;
good-humoredly cursing the too retentive memory of his&#xD;
old friend.&#xD;

&#xD;
authenticated history; nd proves, as well as a volume,&#xD;
the -rough life of a pioneer, we will again return to the&#xD;
Colonel and his guests. .&#xD;
As we have before remarked, the party had finished&#xD;
their dinner, and were upon the eve of trying the Cob.&#xD;
nel's liquor, when the latter, with some uneasiness, spoke&#xD;
of the non-appearance of Head and.the Scout.&#xD;
"It matters very little whether they come or not," said.&#xD;
Malden, with a -heavy frown; "and as for myself, I will&#xD;
hold no counsel with this Captain Head, for he is nothing&#xD;
more or less than a jail bird, and fugitive from justice."&#xD;
Astounded at such a charge against the character of&#xD;
one of the most esteemed citizens of the county, the lit-&#xD;
tle company, for a moment; sat in silence, looking inquir-&#xD;
ingly at the)ast speaker, until Holding, recovering from&#xD;
his surprise, asked an explanation ; remarking that, in the&#xD;
absence of his -friend, he would not permit so grave a&#xD;
charge to pass by unnoticed, unless supported by very&#xD;
satisfactory proof.&#xD;
"Colonel Holding shall have proof in abundance," re-'&#xD;
plied Malden, sneeringly. "I have been waiting for some&#xD;
time the. coming of his dear friend, to make this assertion&#xD;
in his presence, and challenge a denial; but as he has not&#xD;
seen proper to favor us with his much-esteemed company,&#xD;
have deemed it right to do 'so at once, without longer ex-&#xD;
pecting his appearance."&#xD;
" The proof! the proof" muttered two or three voices.&#xD;
"It is present !" said Maiden, a flash of pleastire glgn&#xD;
ing across-his heavy beetle brows, "Captain Mont1k is&#xD;
my author; he knew this.Head in Carolina, and will tell&#xD;
you all about him.:&#xD;
With well-dissembled backwardness, as if loth to injure&#xD;
any one, even by telling the truth, the Captain, thus ap-&#xD;
pealed to, after a little hesitation, told how that Head had&#xD;
been guilty of forgery, and upqu the proof, committed to&#xD;
prison; and how he had escaped, and afterwards clandes-&#xD;
tinely married the daughter of General De Lacy, not for-.&#xD;
getting, as he passed along, to charge him with, being the&#xD;
son of a disgraced spy; -&#xD;
"I can scarce beie ehis3 there must be some mistake;&#xD;
&#xD;
he cannot be such a wretch 1" exclaimed Holding, a cloud&#xD;
gathering upon his open brow, and his been, sharp eyes&#xD;
resting intently upon the smiling face of the unruffled&#xD;
Captain.&#xD;
"May the devil take me if I believe .a word of it !"&#xD;
shouted Dick Dobbins, striking his hand heavily upon&#xD;
the table; "and until Captain Bryan is here, to give it the&#xD;
lie himself, I'll do it for him."&#xD;
"Do you charge me withlying?" exclaimed Malden,&#xD;
angrily.&#xD;
"I charge no man with lying,"- replied Dick; fiercely,&#xD;
"unless he asserts, as true, these charges against Captain&#xD;
Head; and if you do that, Major Malden, then I say, you&#xD;
lie."&#xD;
"There is my author," said Malden,'pointing to Cap-&#xD;
tain Montlack, "he can speak fbro himself," adding with a&#xD;
sneer, "and if unwilling to vouch for the truth of the&#xD;
charge, I certainly cannot."-'&#xD;
"I can excuse the gentleman's heat," remarked the&#xD;
Captain, quietly, "for I honor him in thus standing up in&#xD;
defence of his absent friend; but, nevertheless, the charges&#xD;
I have made against Captain Head, as you are pleased to&#xD;
call him, are all true. Let him but ask his friend the&#xD;
simple question, whether he is not a fugitive from justice,&#xD;
and did not escape from jail when he fled to this country,&#xD;
and he will be more than satisfied that[ Iam no slanderer,&#xD;
and that this manis the infamous character I have painted&#xD;
hip&#xD;
"Who charges my name with infamy?". asked Head, in&#xD;
a husky voice, stalking boldly into the room, closely fol-&#xD;
lowed by the Scout.&#xD;
During the commotion .created by the strange recital&#xD;
of Montlack, and the subsequent angry discussion be-&#xD;
tween Dobbins, Maiden, and the Captain, Head had ap-&#xD;
proached the house uilseen, and was standing near the&#xD;
door, when Dick, with tide friendship, loudly branded&#xD;
the story of the Frenchman as a falsehood, and had heard&#xD;
the remainder of the cowiversationi interrupting it, as we&#xD;
have shown, by sternly demanding the author of the&#xD;
infamous charge ? No sooner was his voice heard, than&#xD;

Dick, springing to his feet, grasped his hand, and the eyes&#xD;
of.the others following the glance of Head himself, rested&#xD;
upon the face of Montlack, who, shrinking back at the&#xD;
appearance of his enemy, had instinctively drawn nearer&#xD;
to Maiden, as if counting on , and expecting his support.&#xD;
"I thank you, Dick, for your generous defence of my&#xD;
character !" exclaimed"' Head with emotion, wringing&#xD;
warmly the hand of his friend, "but it is nothing morn&#xD;
than I expected; for I have always known-you to be&#xD;
noble and brave, and such do not allow their friends to&#xD;
be slandired with' impunity. As for that base bound,"&#xD;
he added, pointing his finger at the shrinking Captain,&#xD;
"I needed not the glance-of your eye to discover my&#xD;
enemy. He has long been my secret foe, and a cowardly,&#xD;
dishonored,-slandering enemy has he been, totally un-&#xD;
worthy either of notice or punishment I"&#xD;
"And has got nigger blood in his .veins to boot !"&#xD;
added the Scout, contemptuously, striking thebutt of his&#xD;
rifle heavily and convincingly upon the floor.&#xD;
"I knew it was false, and that you were innocent!"&#xD;
exclaimed Dick, again extending his hand.&#xD;
"And I," added Holding, his brow clearing up, advanc-&#xD;
ing with a hearty welcome.'&#xD;
"And I! and I!" shouted several other voices, all of&#xD;
the speakers moving quickly away from the side of'Mont-&#xD;
lack,,who stood branded as a coward, liar, and mulatto,&#xD;
leaving him unsupported save by the scowling 4alden.&#xD;
"Bold words these for a felon and fugitive fiim justice!"&#xD;
remarked Montlack with a superciliouis:sneer, "andsfwe&#xD;
would believe the criminal, quite sufficient to convince this&#xD;
very 'willing company of his innocence.&#xD;
"True!" exclaimed Malden, with a malicious laugh;&#xD;
"and I, for one, must have better proof than his say-so!&#xD;
Montlack, who saw .plainly that,;unless he pressed&#xD;
the charge boldly; and used all of his' adroitness to&#xD;
throw doubt upon the minds of his hearers, Head would&#xD;
escape from the toils he had so industriously prepared&#xD;
for him, had ventured1this sneer upon their credulity and&#xD;
partiality, and-seeing that it- was not without effect uppn&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
some : of the party,, added, with .a forced laugh, for he&#xD;
knew the power of a laugh upon most men-&#xD;
"See the hardihood of guilt! His must bea guilty&#xD;
conscience indeed, and a reckless one, since.he has not&#xD;
only branded me as a slanderer, and denied the charge I&#xD;
have made against him, but done so without even know-&#xD;
ing what it is!"&#xD;
"Ha! ha!" laughed Malden (willingly aiding the en-&#xD;
deavors of Montlack), with a scoff and sneer, "'tis too&#xD;
good; but the gentleman must bring some other proof&#xD;
than a bold denial if he would have me believe him inno-&#xD;
cent!"&#xD;
"Put him to the test Ihave proposed," remarked Mont-&#xD;
lack with quiet coolness, "and if you are not then satis-&#xD;
fied that I have spoken nothing more than the truth, I'll&#xD;
acknowledge that I am a slanderer, and submit to be&#xD;
branded as a liar !"&#xD;
"Which will be no new thing, for you have often sub-&#xD;
mitted before; a 'tarnal yaller nigger that you are !" ex-&#xD;
claimed the Scout, with angry vehemence.&#xD;
"The test ! the test 1" shouted Malden. "The test, the&#xD;
test," faintly echoed one or two other voices.&#xD;
".Ay 1 state the charges and let him deny them!1"&#xD;
repeated Montlack.&#xD;
"Does any one present," said Head, drawing up his&#xD;
graceful figure, and speaking in a calm, measured tone,&#xD;
as he glanced proudly around, "believe me the guilty&#xD;
wretch this base slanderer would make me?"&#xD;
"No !" shouted Devil Dick.&#xD;
"1%! no!1" echoed a majority of the voices present.&#xD;
" Ay.-" shouted the hoarse voice of Malden, "unless&#xD;
you answer me a few plain questions, and bring some&#xD;
other proof of your innocence than your own word 1"&#xD;
"Major Malden,'from sore cause, is no friend of mine,"&#xD;
replied Head, "but I 'zxeither covet his friendship, nor&#xD;
fear -his enmity ! To satisfy him, I would answer no&#xD;
questions; but to satisfy my friend; and those who believe&#xD;
me innocent; I am ready to answer all he may put, and&#xD;

"And Simon Kenton is here present,". said the Scout,&#xD;
threateningly, "to sustain, with tongue and hand, the&#xD;
truth of all that -Mister Bryan may say 1"&#xD;
"A most excellent witness, indeed !" remarked Mont.&#xD;
lack with a cunning smile, "who promises in advance to&#xD;
indorse the evidence of another 1"&#xD;
"More than any one would do for the like of you,"&#xD;
answered the Scout, quickly divining the intent of Mont.&#xD;
lack; "but you need not expect, with your snaky tongue,&#xD;
to cast a doubt over my testimony ; for," added the Scout,&#xD;
proudly, "I am not now among strangers, and all pre-&#xD;
sent know Simon Kenton 1"&#xD;
Malden, without noticing the implied threat of Kenton,&#xD;
or the sharp passage between him and Montlack, other=&#xD;
wise than by a transitory frown and smile, replied to&#xD;
Head by saying-'&#xD;
"My enmity, sir, shall not make me forget justice, nor&#xD;
should friendship blind the judgment of these gentlemen !"&#xD;
nodding at Holding and Dobbins. "I would have the&#xD;
truth, and nothing more. Captain Montlack there, who&#xD;
comes to us, bearing at least the name and reputation of&#xD;
a gentleman, declares that you, Captain Head, while a&#xD;
citizen of Carolina, were arrested ,upon the charge of&#xD;
forgery, and after a fair trial, sent to prison, from whence&#xD;
you made your escape and fled to this country, and that&#xD;
you are, moreover, the son of a traitor and spy ! As&#xD;
gentlemen, we are bound to believe him, unless you deny&#xD;
these charges, and show us that he is unworthy of credit.&#xD;
We await your reply ; what say you, are these charges&#xD;
true or false ?"&#xD;
"The first two," replied Head, resolutely, "are true ;&#xD;
the last as false as bell, or the treacherous heart of the&#xD;
base slanderer that gave it circulation 1"&#xD;
At this unlooked-for and straightforward reply, the&#xD;
countenances of Holding and Dobbins were clouded with&#xD;
doubt and suspicion; and several of those who had sided&#xD;
with them against Montlack drew back as if now satisfied&#xD;
of the guilt of Head ; and Malden, with a gleam of mali-&#xD;
cious triumph, met the exultant smile of Captain Jean&#xD;
with an exclamation of unconcealed satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
1I&#xD;
&#xD;
"But," continued Head, with the calmness of ,inno-&#xD;
cence, hastening to' dispel the doubts of his friends and&#xD;
the triumph of his enemies, 4 notwithstanding. thedflrst&#xD;

"And I1" shouted Dobbins.&#xD;
"And I, and I !".echoed half a dozen: other voices.&#xD;
"Ay ![if you take his word, and the testimony of his&#xD;
slave and associates," sneered Montlack; making a des-&#xD;
perate effort to sustain his ground, "there will be no&#xD;
difficulty in his' proving himself innocent. He has"been&#xD;
tried once before, as he acknowledges, and by an impar-&#xD;
tial court; and that courts if you believe his own story,&#xD;
were so confident of his guilt as to send him, without&#xD;
hesitation, to prison."&#xD;
"True !" exclaimed Maiden, who had been either so far,&#xD;
prejudiced by the. artful stories of Montlack as really to&#xD;
remain unconvinced, or, on account of his enmity to&#xD;
Head, was unwilling and determined not to be'so," we&#xD;
must not forget that; and had better not be in too great&#xD;
a hurry to believe his =innocence:"&#xD;
The remark of Malden, although $hrown out to dampen&#xD;
the feelings of his hearers, and cast, if possible, a; doubt&#xD;
upon the defence of Head, and at the same time lessen,&#xD;
may-be, the apparent proof positive of Montlack's guilt,&#xD;
did not seem to have the effect intended;~for the former,&#xD;
conscious of no.guilt on his part, met the quick glance of&#xD;
his friends with the open and confident calmness of inno-&#xD;
cence; while the latter, notwithstanding the support thus&#xD;
given him, and the self-possession obtained and made a&#xD;
part of his nature by the long practice of hypocrisy and&#xD;
deceit, could not, in spite of every effort to appear calm,&#xD;
look as unconcerned as he wished under their suspicious&#xD;
and lowering scrutiny.&#xD;
"That man," said Head, without then noticing the&#xD;
eager support giyen by Malden to Montlack, pointing&#xD;
his finger at the letter, "for no other reason than that I&#xD;
balked a villanous scheme of his to obtain the wealth of&#xD;
his uncle by securing the hand of his'daughter, has for&#xD;
many years been my unforgiving and ruthless foe ; fol-&#xD;
lowing my trail with all the bloody zeal of a slot-hound,&#xD;
and not hesitating.to resort to the basest and most cow-&#xD;
ardly means to work me injury. Once before, I offered&#xD;
to meet him, man to man, and give him an opportunity&#xD;
&#xD;
of avenging any fancied injury I may have done him; but&#xD;
with a coward's excuse he declined the combat. Now,&#xD;
again," he added, with a stern emphasis, "for I would not&#xD;
have an unscrupulous enemy thus forever dogging my&#xD;
track; although a base knave, and liar, and slanderer, I&#xD;
will give him the same opportunity, if he dare accept it."&#xD;
As such was the common mode of settling all injuries&#xD;
among the hardy borderers of the West, the party present&#xD;
did not seem at all surprised at the challenge given by&#xD;
Head, but looked to Montlack as if expecting nothing&#xD;
less than his ready acceptance,; and, had he only had&#xD;
sufficient nerve to abide by the combat, he would have&#xD;
at least, if not freed himself from  the odium of his&#xD;
base course, raised himself greatly in their estimation;&#xD;
for brute bravery with them, as it does now with their&#xD;
more refined and civilized descendants, covered a multi-&#xD;
tude of sins. But the Captain had no such thought, and&#xD;
to the challenge of his opponent faintly muttered--&#xD;
"If insulted by a gentleman, or my equal, I will fight&#xD;
him; but the low abuse of a felon and fugitive from pri-&#xD;
son shall not force me to meet him in honorable combat."&#xD;
A muttered curse from Malden, and a low sullen mur-&#xD;
mur of disapprobation from the others, greeted this unex-&#xD;
pected reply ; but Head was not yet satisfied, for he had&#xD;
not forgotten the malicious eagerness with which the for-&#xD;
mer had pressed the slanderous charges of his cowardly&#xD;
foe; and turning now, with his eye fastened full upon the&#xD;
dark and frowning face of Malden, he remarked, signifi-&#xD;
cantly-&#xD;
"If there is one present who dares uphold this man,&#xD;
and doubts.for a moment my innocence, or says he still&#xD;
believes the slander of this wretch, either against myself&#xD;
or the fair fame of my father, then I pronounce him a&#xD;
base knave, and no better than he who stands there now&#xD;
branded as a liar and slanderer."&#xD;
"I do the same !" exclaimed Kenton, striking his rifle&#xD;
emphatically upon the floor," and will fight him with bul-&#xD;
let or knife-be he the devil, a nigger, or Major Malden."&#xD;

the handle of his knife; but, at this moment, he was in-&#xD;
terrupted by the sudden appearance and loud greeting of&#xD;
a strange-looking being; and, as this unexpected appear-&#xD;
ance was quickly followed by a most ludicrous catastrophe,&#xD;
in which Montlack, the source of the quarrel, became the&#xD;
laughable victim, he never finished his angry retort; but&#xD;
for the time, under the influence of the merriment created&#xD;
by Captain Jean's 'discomfiture, and the timely and hur-&#xD;
ried persuasions of Holding, sullenly submitted to the&#xD;
conditional challenges of Head and the Scout, smothering&#xD;
his anger for some future occasion, and;byno means for-&#xD;
giving or intending to forget the insult offered him.&#xD;
The cause of this very opportune interruption, was a&#xD;
well-known and most singular character, rejoicing under&#xD;
the euphonious title of Amy Adkins. Amy, to the eye of&#xD;
a trarget presented nothing more than a striking per-&#xD;
sonification of a lounging, careless squatter-lank, wiry,&#xD;
and hard-featied; with a dress half savage and half civil-&#xD;
zed; without much unison either in apparel or features,&#xD;
therebeing no harmony in anything about him, save an&#xD;
uncommon tendency of both limbs and*clothes-to dangle&#xD;
loosely about, as if belonging to anybody else but the&#xD;
owner of the bald bullet-head surmounting his-shoulders.&#xD;
Every man has some peculiar hobby or mania; hunt-&#xD;
ing bugs, and easy ways of living without work, are now&#xD;
quite -fashionables; but old Amy was possessed of a devil,&#xD;
or mania, as unaccountable and strange as he himself&#xD;
was unique; and his mania was an uncontrollable pen-&#xD;
chant for "butting."  When we say "butting," we mean&#xD;
a very intimate and striking acquaintance between the&#xD;
crown of the aforesaid bullet-head and any resisting ob-&#xD;
ject; and hence, the baldness of Amy, and the familiar&#xD;
sobriquet of the "old goat," which he wore throughout&#xD;
the country. So great was Amy's passion for trying the&#xD;
thickness .of his own-skull, and running a muck with his&#xD;
head against every opponent, that he has been known to&#xD;
try it upon soft-bark trees, and doors that stood invitingly&#xD;
before him, and upon every species of animal, from the&#xD;
ox down to the sheep. At any moment, one might ex-&#xD;
pect a pleasantvsalute of this sort from old Amy; and his&#xD;
&#xD;
wife and children, around the fireside, and in the field at&#xD;
work, without any conceivable reason or notice, have&#xD;
often experienced the unlooked-for and ill effects of this&#xD;
goatish propensity. It was a standing joke (or rather, a&#xD;
falling one, for it most generally resulted in the overthrow&#xD;
of the victim) o., old Amy's, to seize most cordially by the&#xD;
hand, an acquaintance, or stranger, and, while expressing&#xD;
his pleasure at the meeting, to deal him a most scientific&#xD;
blow with his head in the stomach, which, from its vigor&#xD;
and skill, and unexpectedness, invariably resulted .in his&#xD;
very sudden acquaintance with mother earth. If the&#xD;
victim of this craniological movement was a stranger, and&#xD;
unacquainted with the "butting" propensities of Amy, the&#xD;
old man would treat his downfall as purely the result of&#xD;
accident, expressing great astonishment, and a thousand&#xD;
apologies, generally winding up with a second offer of his&#xD;
hand, which, if accepted,*was invariably followed by a&#xD;
second butt, and a second overthrow, after which, the old&#xD;
gentleman would make off, highly delighted with his&#xD;
day's sport. But so well known had old Amy become rn&#xD;
the country, that his innocent sport was wellnigh de-&#xD;
stroyed; for, without hearing the cry-" there's straw&#xD;
upon his horns," he was universally shunned by man and&#xD;
beast, and could only gratify his mania at rare intervals,&#xD;
and upon the person of strangers.&#xD;
Such is a true sketch of the individual so opportunely&#xD;
interrupting the quarrel between Head and Malden.&#xD;
Dancing into the room, with his arms, legs, and head&#xD;
swinging negligently about, as if made of gum-elastic,&#xD;
-and totally unconnected with his body, old Amy ex-&#xD;
claimed, in a loud nasal tone, for he scorned breathing&#xD;
through any other member than his natural bellows, as&#xD;
he called it-&#xD;
"Hello, boys! what's to pay now? Old Amy don't&#xD;
allow any fighting when he's present. How are you,&#xD;
Colonel; and you.ick, and the Major, and all of you,&#xD;
not forgetting this stranger ?".&#xD;
The Colonel and the other, knowing ones, kept a wary&#xD;
eye upon the movements of the new-comer, none of them&#xD;
offering him their hands, but all answerig his noisy sa-&#xD;

lute good-humoredly, and bowing with distant politeness,&#xD;
a thing very unusual in that age 'and generation, when a&#xD;
lusty shake of the hand was considered the greatest mark&#xD;
ofaa hearty welcome and friendship.&#xD;
But Dick Dobbins, noticing the inquiring eye of old&#xD;
Amy fixed upon the face of Montlack, and withal, being&#xD;
a kind-hearted fellow, as easy to melt as enrage, and feel-&#xD;
ing, now that the Captain had been disgraced, some sym-&#xD;
pathy for his lonely and miserable-situation, with all the&#xD;
amiability of his heart fully aroused and excited, deter-&#xD;
mined, for the present, to stand his friend, and introduce&#xD;
him to the kind welcome of the Old Goat.&#xD;
"Uncle Amy !" he exclaimed, catching the eye of Ad-&#xD;
kins, and answering it with a sly wink, "let me introduce&#xD;
to your kind consideration, Captain Montlack, of Caro-u&#xD;
"How de do, Captain? I'm ilevilish glad to see you,"&#xD;
(a solemn truth, for human subjects had been scarce of&#xD;
late,) shouted old Amy, extending his hand; his head, and&#xD;
armsand limbs all the time flying about like those of a&#xD;
dancing figure in a pantomime.&#xD;
"Most happy to make your acquaintance," returned&#xD;
Montla'ck, warmly, for he knew the small. number of&#xD;
friends he had present, and wished to make another; "bit"&#xD;
-and he was going on to say something more, as he&#xD;
eagerly grasped the offered hand of Amy, but his "but".&#xD;
was met by such a terrible "rebutter" from the head of old&#xD;
Amy, that it was driven at once and forever entirely from&#xD;
his recollection, and the next moment the Captain found&#xD;
himself sprawling upon the floor.&#xD;
"I axe your pardon, Captain!" exclaimed Amy; run-&#xD;
ning to the assistance of Montlack, "old Amy meant no&#xD;
harm in the world; he was merely bowin' to express his&#xD;
pleasure at the honor of your acquaintance, and this darned&#xD;
old head of his went into you 'ginst his knowledge and&#xD;
consent. I hope you ain't worsted much, Captain," con-&#xD;
tinued Adkins, with great apparent sympathy, Montlack&#xD;
having again, with his assistance, recovered his feet,&#xD;
though by no means entirely restored his breath.&#xD;
"No, not much; I believe not !" gasped the victim.&#xD;
&#xD;
"You ain't mad, or.nothin' of that sort, Captain ?" said&#xD;
Adkins, "and don't, think hard of old Amy, for this lit-&#xD;
tle accident ?"&#xD;
"0O, no I" muttered Montlack, his suspicions entirely&#xD;
removed by the apparent kindness and sympathy of&#xD;
Amy.&#xD;
- "Then give us your hand, Captain; for here's old Amy's&#xD;
paw; and when you grasp it agin, as a token that you don't&#xD;
hold a grudge 'ginst me for that little accident, then you&#xD;
may count me yourn till death, bothhand and head."&#xD;
" Here it is !" returned Mqntlack,gain, grasping the&#xD;
offered hand of Amy.&#xD;
"And here's the head, what goes with it!1" exclaimed&#xD;
Amy; again dealing the Captain a tremendous butt, lay-&#xD;
ing him out, for the second time, breathless upon the&#xD;
floor.&#xD;
A loud shout of laughter, greeted this second discom-&#xD;
fiture of Montlack; for 'no one, not even his.associate,&#xD;
Malden, felt any sympathy for him in his distress, or ex-&#xD;
pressed any pity at his painful, but ludicrous overthrow.&#xD;
"Give him my respects, boys," said Adkins, moving&#xD;
off, "and tell him, now don't forget it, not to think hard&#xD;
of old Amy, for it's only one of his ways, and -e don't&#xD;
mean any harm by' it-more nor than a joke."&#xD;
Gaining the door (for, notwithstanding his victory, and&#xD;
his victim put hors de combat, old Amy seemed desi-&#xD;
rous to place himself beyond the reach of any contin-&#xD;
gency in the shape of a' bullet), the old fellow with a&#xD;
patronizing air rubbed his head a moment; giving vent,&#xD;
as he did so, to a low chuckle of satisfaction; then turn-&#xD;
ing to the company within, with a profound bow, he again&#xD;
requested them to assure the Captain it was all a joke;&#xD;
after which, without further ado, he mounted his horse,&#xD;

take advantage of the lull created by these occurrences,&#xD;
to smother the quarrel, on the eve of breaking out be-&#xD;
tween Head, Malden, and the Scout, by proposing that&#xD;
they should at once resume their seats at the table, and&#xD;
finish the business  for which they had been called to-&#xD;
gether. Malden, though sullen and discontented, seemed&#xD;
in no way inclined to renew the quarrel, interrupted&#xD;
by the appearance and subsequent doings of old Amy;&#xD;
and no one objecting to this very reasonable proposition&#xD;
of the Colonel, the company present,. including now the&#xD;
Scout and Head, once more took their places around the&#xD;
hospitable board of Holding, and were soon engaged in&#xD;
busy, and apparently harmonious conversation.&#xD;
They had been called together by Holding, as Colonel&#xD;
of the last expedition against the savages, to decide upon&#xD;
the most feasible plan of securing the settlements against&#xD;
any future attack from the Indians. This design accom-&#xD;
plished, and Kenton directed to continue scouting upon&#xD;
the borders, the company were upon the eve of breaking&#xD;
up and returning to their homes, when Malden, who had&#xD;
during the consultation been rather more reserved and&#xD;
silent than was usual with him, suddenly interrupted this&#xD;
evidentintention, by exclaiming---&#xD;
"Before we part, gentlemen, there is one more subject&#xD;
to which I would. draw your attention, for I think it well&#xD;
deserves some general move in' the community. As for&#xD;
the Indians, I think it well enough to be prepared for&#xD;
them, although I have no fears of another attack from&#xD;
that quarter very soon; but we have in our midst men&#xD;
no better than these savages; I mean, a band of horse.&#xD;
thieves; and unless we adopt some plan to defend our-&#xD;
selves against their future depredations, we shall soon be&#xD;
left without a hoof to till our grounds, or go upon a&#xD;
foray."&#xD;
"You speak very truly, Major Malden," replied Hold-&#xD;
ing, "and I would like right well if you could suggest&#xD;
some way to rid the country of these daring rascals.&#xD;
They have not forgotten to look into my stables, in their&#xD;
recent expeditions; and, no longer than last week, I lost&#xD;
one of my best horses."&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, VOW FULFILLED              177&#xD;
"And I! and I!1" chimed in three or four other voices,&#xD;
showing that the thieves had been in no way partial.&#xD;
"As we have no law to punish them," replied Malden,&#xD;
"unless we unite among ourselves, and make it a common&#xD;
duty of the community to see that punishment be in-&#xD;
flicted upon the rascals, we might as well grant the&#xD;
scoundrels at once the free privilege of roguery; for no&#xD;
one individual, unless supported by the purse and assist-&#xD;
ance of his neighbors, can pursue the villains, with. any&#xD;
chance of success."&#xD;
"What do you propose ?" asked Holding.&#xD;
"I have been thinking over this matter lately,"- An-&#xD;
swered Malden, while a heavy frown gathered upon his&#xD;
brow, "and have concluded that the best and only plan&#xD;
promising success, is for every gentleman present,.and&#xD;
others as we may see them, to pledge their word,, and&#xD;
ratify it with an oath, that, upon information given us&#xD;
of Iany theft, we will as a band, organized for that&#xD;
special. purpose, pursue the thief until he is discovered;&#xD;
and when discovered, that we will hang him up, without&#xD;
law or jury, and let his fate stand as a warning to all&#xD;
other knaves."&#xD;
"An excellent plan, that !" muttered'Montlack to him-&#xD;
self; for, having recovered from the shock given by old&#xD;
Amy's patent battery, he had drawn sufficiently near to&#xD;
hear what was going on within; "and in cunning hands,"&#xD;
he added with a devilish smile, "may be made to work&#xD;
wonders."&#xD;
"A quick, but happy riddance !" remarked Devil Dick,&#xD;
with a careless laugh; -"for we can hang them when we&#xD;
find them, and try them when we have leisure."&#xD;
":Can you suggest a wiser or better 'plan, sir ?" asked&#xD;
Malden, surlily.&#xD;
"Not I," answered Dick, with the same-reckless in-&#xD;
difference; "for I know of no shorter or better plan of&#xD;
ridding the country of these rascals, and at the same time&#xD;
save ourselves unnecessary trouble. We may hang an&#xD;
innocent man now and then; but that is a matter of small&#xD;
consequence, if we are only right in a majority of cases."&#xD;
Malden looked up as if by no means pleased with the&#xD;

&#xD;
pleasant and flippant manner in which Dick had treated&#xD;
his grave proposition, but made no reply.&#xD;
"I must confess," said Holding, "that the mode pro-&#xD;
posed is a little too bloody and summary to suit my&#xD;
taste; but as we have no law in this wild country but&#xD;
the law of might, and no prisons, and as one victim may&#xD;
act as a scarecrow to all others, I know of no better&#xD;
course, and see no reason why we should not adopt the&#xD;
Major's plan; although I sincerely trust that we may&#xD;
never be called upon to execute it."&#xD;
"As you say, we have no prisons, and, if we had, I&#xD;
consider confinement entirely too light a punishment for&#xD;
a damned horse-thief," growled Malden. "I, for one, am&#xD;
for.death; and here now pledge my word not to shrink,&#xD;
when called upon, but to aid, both with purse and hand, in&#xD;
executing this sentence upon any and every horse-thief."&#xD;
"And I! and I 1" was the exclamation of every one&#xD;
present.'&#xD;
"And I!" hissed Montlack to himself, a gleam of ma-&#xD;
licious pleasure covering his pale countenance.&#xD;
"You all swear it ?" continued Malden, in a harsh and&#xD;
stern voice, at the same time glancing searchingly around&#xD;
to see that no one shunned the oath.&#xD;
"We swear !" was the solemn response of each indi-&#xD;
vidual-'.--&#xD;
"Amen to that oath !" muttered Montlack; "for the&#xD;
devil himself could not have made a better mesh to in-&#xD;
sure me bloody revenge."&#xD;
"Then," exclaimed Malden, draining a cup of liquor,&#xD;
"'here's to the speedy death of every rascally horse-thief&#xD;
in the territory !"&#xD;
"You'shall soon have a taste of blood, my old bear,"&#xD;
muttered Montlack, with a low laugh of exultation, as he&#xD;
looked in upon the ferocious countenance of his late&#xD;
friend.&#xD;
"And here's that the horse-loving gentry may all flee&#xD;
the country forthwith, and never call on us for this'&#xD;
hempen cravat we've promised them !" laughed Devil&#xD;
Dick, tossing off his toast.&#xD;
"Amen !" ejaculated Holding and Head.&#xD;
&#xD;
"May the , devil take me if I say amen to that,"&#xD;
growled Malden.&#xD;
"Nor I," hissed Captain Jean to himself; "for I do not&#xD;
intend this oath to be a mere silly formula. They have'&#xD;
sworn; and Captain Jean Montlack has lost all his cun-&#xD;
ning if that oath does not yet cause death."&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XV..&#xD;
&#xD;
"THERE is no doubt of his guilt; the court would&#xD;
have convicted him without hesitation had he not escaped&#xD;
from prison; and as for that foolish story, trumped up by&#xD;
him and his half-savage companion, it is false from begin-&#xD;
ning to end, without even the merit, when you look at it&#xD;
coolly, of having the semblance of reason. I am not sur-&#xD;
prised at that pompous fool, Holding, who thinks, because&#xD;
he was selected to command the' last expedition against&#xD;
the Indians, that he must now become the leader and&#xD;
director of the settlement; or at that silly jay, Dobbins,&#xD;
believing such a cock-and-bull story ; but I must confess&#xD;
myself somewhat astonished that you, Major Malden,&#xD;
should feel any doubts, or permt yourself thus to be&#xD;
imposed upon."&#xD;
Such was the artful reply of Montlack to some ques-&#xD;
tion of Malden, as the two were passing along together&#xD;
through the woods, near the house of the latter, upoit the&#xD;
day following the events narrated in our last chapter.&#xD;
Montlack had already discovered the Major's jealousy of&#xD;
Holding, and had not miscalculated the effect of his artful&#xD;
and somewhat depreciating reference to that gentleman,&#xD;
and his staunch and unswerving supporter, Dick Dob-&#xD;
bins. He also well knew the influence of a little flattery;&#xD;
and in his reply, it will be noticed that he had cunningly&#xD;
excited both the jealousy and vanity of Malden'with the&#xD;
purpose of strengthening and confirming his'dislike to&#xD;
Head, and, at the same time, arraying him in open oppo-&#xD;
sition to the friends and allies of the latter.&#xD;

"HIolding is, a silly fool, as you say," growled Malden;&#xD;
and as  for that rattle-brained Dobbins, he is a mere&#xD;
toady. of  the Colonel's, with only brains enough to be&#xD;
headstrong and dangerous; for, to give the dog his due,&#xD;
he's as brave as the devil. But why, Captain Mpntlack,"&#xD;
continued Malden, looking steadily at his companion, and&#xD;
speaking as if this reference to the bravery of Dobbins&#xD;
had suggested the inquiry, 'did you not resent the abuse&#xD;
of this fellow, Head, and accept his challenge ?  It is not&#xD;
usual,. in this country, to permit such abuse to pass un-&#xD;
punished, or a direct challenge, like his, to remain unac-&#xD;
cepted."&#xD;
I know not the custom of this country ; for, I am, as&#xD;
you are aware, but a stranger in it," replied Montlack,&#xD;
showing very little, if any, embarrassment at the, charge&#xD;
implied by the inquiry of Malden; "but in France, and&#xD;
in the army, it was not the custom with gentlemen to&#xD;
accept the challenge of a disgracedand dishonored man ;&#xD;
..and; before head the right to call upon an enemy to meet&#xD;
him in the field, he must first have cleared up every charge&#xD;
against his fair fame, at least to. the satisfaction of his&#xD;
brother officers and associates of the same rank and stand-&#xD;
ing in society. Nor was it customary to resent the abuse&#xD;
of those beneath us in rank and station in so honorable a&#xD;
manner. You must acknowledge, Major, there would be&#xD;
but little reason, and less equality, in a gentleman of&#xD;
wealth andrank, risking his life and limbs in  personal&#xD;
combat with a low-born, silly booby, who had everything&#xD;
to gain, and nothing to lose. We are only required to&#xD;
meet our. equals ;, and Captain Montlack has never yet&#xD;
been fo4   backward when thus called upon. As. for&#xD;
accepting Te challenge of, a man I know to be a felon,&#xD;
and a fugitive froni justice, as he himself acknowledges,&#xD;
Could. not for a moment think of such a thing, and&#xD;
should consider myself disgraced forever had I done' so."&#xD;
" 1 believe you have spoken correctly,'as to the course&#xD;
pursued by gentlemen in the army, in the old country,"&#xD;
said Malden, his doubts of the bravery of his com-&#xD;
panion being very much lessened by this straightforward,&#xD;
plausible explanation of Montlack; "but I will give you&#xD;
&#xD;
to understand, Captain, that out here, this old code has&#xD;
exploded; and it is customary with us, to accept all chal-&#xD;
lenges, and meet any one; it matters not whether high&#xD;
or low. But then, Captain," added Malden, still pressing&#xD;
Montlack's refusal, "according to. your own code, you&#xD;
should have accepted the challenge of this Mr. Head; for&#xD;
he enjoys the rank of a gentleman, and proved, to the satis-&#xD;
faction of at least a large majority of his associates and&#xD;
equals, his innocence of the charge made against him, and&#xD;
his title to their esteem and respect."&#xD;
"If I am not mistaken," retorted Montlack, with a&#xD;
sneer, not able to answer his companion in any other way,&#xD;
"this same honorable gentleman gave Major Maiden an&#xD;
opportunity of accepting the honor so 'imprudently re-&#xD;
jected by Captain Montlack."&#xD;
' Captain Montlack," replied Malden, with stern empha-&#xD;
sis, his shaggy brows almost meeting over his flashing&#xD;
eye, "may have a chance of proving his bravery, by&#xD;
accepting the challenge of Major' Malden, unless he hus-&#xD;
bands, with more care, his sneers and innuendoes. I am&#xD;
not one to submit to the charge of cowardice, even by&#xD;
implication; and if Captain Montlack would'not dare&#xD;
the resentment of him they call the 'Bloody-handed,' he&#xD;
had best not touch upon such a subject."&#xD;
Montlack, seeing that he had gone too far, and had&#xD;
excited in no small degree the anger of his companion,&#xD;
hastened at once to explain that he meant to give no in-&#xD;
sult, either by word or implication; and that the bravery&#xD;
of Major Malden was too well established for any one,&#xD;
who had ever heard of his daring deeds, for a moment to&#xD;
doubt.&#xD;
Mollified by Captain Jean's ready explanation, mingled&#xD;
as it was by flattering allusions to the reputation he en-&#xD;
joyed throughout the territory, the sullen face of Malden&#xD;
again cleared up ; but, as if still conscious of there being&#xD;
some grounds for the Captain's sneering remark, at which&#xD;
he had taken such umbrage, without immediately' drop-&#xD;
ping this delicate subject, he continued-&#xD;
"The challenge you mention was a general one, and&#xD;
conditional; but made, I acknowledge, with a significant&#xD;

look, that denoted the object, and, by heavens !" he added,&#xD;
his face flaming up with anger, at the very thought, "had&#xD;
not old Adkins interrupted me at the moment, he should&#xD;
not have escaped ; I care, not what his station or charac-&#xD;
ter; be he thief,-forger, or convict."&#xD;
"Damn old Adkins," muttered Montlack, almost losing&#xD;
his breath at the yery recollection of Amy's goatish pro-&#xD;
pensity for impressive jokes; "he should be placed in a&#xD;
strait-jacket, and :encouraged to butt out his brains, if&#xD;
he has .any, against stone walls."&#xD;
"Ha! hat" laughed Malden, with the hoarse growl of&#xD;
a bear, forgetting his'own anger while enjoying the fury of&#xD;
Montlack; " old Amy came devilish nigh, Captain, butting&#xD;
you into the middle oTnext week! For the life of me," he&#xD;
continued, seeing that Montlack by np means enjoyed his&#xD;
merriment, "I can't help laughing, when I think how&#xD;
the old goat fooled you."&#xD;
"Let it .pass," retorted Montlack, quickly, "and with it&#xD;
all memory of that cursed meeting; for what occurred&#xD;
there, I find," he sneeringly continued, "by no means&#xD;
very pleasant, either to Major Malden or myself."&#xD;
"Beware! Captain Montlack," muttered Malden, all&#xD;
traces of merriment gone in a moment at this. distant&#xD;
allusion of his companion; "I give but one warning, and&#xD;
that you have already' had:"&#xD;
"And that was unnecessary," answered Montlack, " for&#xD;
I am not one to willingly wound the feelings of a friend."&#xD;
Malden made no reply, and for a few minutes, the two&#xD;
'walked on in silence. At length, as if suddenly struck&#xD;
with the thought, the Major turned upon Montlack, and&#xD;
in his usi Lbluff manner exclaimed--&#xD;
"But vh tsay you, Captain, to the testimony of Ken-&#xD;
ton, respecting this charge, made by you, against Head ?"&#xD;
"That it is false from beginning to end; and this Cap-&#xD;
tain Kenton, as he calls himself, no better than Head; and,&#xD;
if the truth was known, a confederate."&#xD;
" A§ for this fellow, Head," Said Malden, "I'never&#xD;
thought much of him; and think, with you, that he is no&#xD;
better than he should be; but as for Kenton, Ihave known&#xD;
him' long and well, and must say, notwithstanding he&#xD;
&#xD;
exhibits no love for myself, that he is both. brave and&#xD;
truthful. But he knows nothing of guile or deceit; and&#xD;
this Head, who appears a smooth, plausible fellow enough,&#xD;
may have deceived -him, like he has deceived everybody&#xD;
else. Kenton, blinded by his affection for this man-for&#xD;
he was ever warm-hearted and devotedto his friends-&#xD;
may have been deceived by circumstances; but, that he&#xD;
spoke falsely, and did so designedly, I do not, and never&#xD;
will believe."&#xD;
Montlack was unable to conceal his surprise -at this&#xD;
very unexpected defence of the Scout from the mouth of&#xD;
his enemy. He would not have been at all astonished at&#xD;
abuse, or slander, or low innuendo; for base, and treacher,&#xD;
ous, and unprincipled himself, he never spoke in praise or&#xD;
defence of a friend or acquaintance, except to their face,&#xD;
and to further some selfish end of his own; but was ever&#xD;
ready, behind their backs, to pour out his filthy slime both&#xD;
on friend and enemy alike; and now, to hear an enemy speak&#xD;
well of one known to be hostile, was beyond the compre-&#xD;
hension of his narrow soul, and no wonder it excited his&#xD;
unbounded astonishment. Finding, however, from this&#xD;
unlooked-for reply of Malden, that he had been too hasty&#xD;
in his wholesale abuse of Kenton, the cunning Captain&#xD;
about-ship at once, trimming his sails for another tack,&#xD;
by hurriedly explaining that he knew nothing against the&#xD;
character of the Scout, but only judged him by the com-&#xD;
pany he kept. As for:Head, feeling that he was on safe&#xD;
ground there, and that Malden, if not entirely convinced&#xD;
of the heavy charges he hadmade against him, was only&#xD;
too ready to be so, the Captai did not hesitate.to reiterate&#xD;
his slanders, calling down upon his own he-1d gthe most&#xD;
shameful punishments if he misrepresented nhi  one jot&#xD;
or tittle.&#xD;
The subtle Captain, who was a quick reader of men,&#xD;
saw that his artful words were 'not without their influence&#xD;
upon his silent companion; but if he had any doubts at&#xD;
all, they were speedily removed by the harsh voice of&#xD;
Malden, exclaiming-&#xD;
"I.doubt it not! I doubt it not ! He is a smooth-tongued,&#xD;
plausible knave; but now that my eyes are open, he will&#xD;

&#xD;
not escape me long. He has twice thrown himself in my&#xD;
path, and twice dared the-anger of the 'Bloody-hand;' let&#xD;
him beware of the third offence."&#xD;
Not caring to press the subject further, Montlack made&#xD;
no answer to this ominous threat, and for, a few minutes&#xD;
the two pedestrians walked onin silence.&#xD;
At length, Montlack, as if no longer desirous of the&#xD;
company of his moody companion, or wearied with the&#xD;
distance he had already come, laid his hand upon the&#xD;
shoulder of Malden, exclaiming-&#xD;
"By my faith, Major! if I follow you much longer, I.&#xD;
had better keep company for the day, for I shall never find&#xD;
my way back."&#xD;
Looking up into the heavens, as if he would learn the&#xD;
hour of the day by the situation of the sun, Malden made&#xD;
some reply, then drawing his belt tighter around him, as&#xD;
if preparing for a more extended journey, after a few&#xD;
hurried words, the two parted-company, the Major taking&#xD;
his way alone through the woods; whilst the Captain, as&#xD;
if wearied with the length of his walk, sat himself down,&#xD;
either to await the return of his companion, or, as he was&#xD;
by no means fond of violent exercise, to rest himself ere&#xD;
he commenced retracing his path.&#xD;
"There he goes; a rough, headstrong bear," muttered&#xD;
Montlack, as the stout figure. of his late companion van-&#xD;
ished from sight over a neighboring hill, "and well worthy&#xD;
of the bloody name so flattering to hisisavage pride."&#xD;
"Ha! ha! my dear Major," he laughed, sneeringly,&#xD;
"you may be my superior in following the trail of an In-&#xD;
dian, and in scalping the savage warrior when you have&#xD;
killed him,:_but when it comes to cunning, you are but a&#xD;
child in the hands of Captain Jean Montlack. You have&#xD;
brute strength and courage, I grant you that, and so has&#xD;
the bear or mastiff; but what can they do in a combat&#xD;
with mind. O ho! you snap me up with threats and&#xD;
frowns; but wait awhile, my dear friend, and, in spite of&#xD;
your pride and strength, I'll twist you round my finger&#xD;
as I would a string of, flax, and make you my base tool,&#xD;
the blind worker of my wishes, even into dyeing your&#xD;
'bloody hand' with still more-gore ! Variity and jealousy .&#xD;
can do wonders; but who would have thought this rough&#xD;
&#xD;
fool could thus be led by the nose, with a little flattery!&#xD;
But hold! let me think'awhile, and not rush unprepared&#xD;
to the attack, merely to be driven again, ignominiously,&#xD;
from the field ! Damn that fellow, I believe he's in league&#xD;
with the devil;-for twice ave I netted him, as fairly and&#xD;
securely as cunning could throw the toils, and both times&#xD;
has he escaped me, and not only that, but left me covered&#xD;
with disgrace ! But never mind; my time will come yet!&#xD;
Let me think, now, for it is time this silly struggle was&#xD;
ended, and Captain Montlack-no longer- Montlack, but&#xD;
De Lacy-was back at the old homestead, enjoying the&#xD;
fruits of hissuccess. Ay, my pretty cousin ! you scorned&#xD;
my suit, didyou! and your Mr. Head dared step between&#xD;
me and fortune ; and.you, my honest Duffe, presumed to&#xD;
buffet with your hand the face of a gentleman ; and you,&#xD;
Mr. Kenton, or devil, or Scout, or whatever you may be,&#xD;
disgraced the arms of Captain Montlack with a rope, and&#xD;
made him the subject of your low jokes. I have not for-&#xD;
gotten any of you, you see; nor will I permit you," hissed&#xD;
the soliloquist between his teeth, "soon to forget me. But&#xD;
let me think ; for revenge, wealth, and safety are now at&#xD;
stake, and I must not lose either by too much haste or&#xD;
want of deliberation."&#xD;
Resting his head upon the palm of his hand, andlstretch-&#xD;
ing his body out at full length upon the moss-covered&#xD;
log on which he had been sitting, the plotting Captain&#xD;
was soon lost in thought, and forgetful of the wild.scene&#xD;
around him, and all things else, but the dark 'schemes of&#xD;
his own busy mind.&#xD;
The sun was shining out lightly, but there was not a&#xD;
breath of wind, and the birds and insects, as if aware of&#xD;
the presence of a wicked spirit, were hushed, and would&#xD;
not sing. A solemn silence-the deep and hushed silence&#xD;
of the forest at rest-which can be compared to nothing&#xD;
but the slumber of death, reigned around, and to any one&#xD;
less busy with his own thoughts than Montlack, could not&#xD;
have passed unnoticed, and would not have been without&#xD;
its mysterious awe-engendering influence upon his soul.&#xD;
But the Captain was plotting death, and no thought of&#xD;
God or nature ever entered his breast. The good spirit&#xD;

186           THE WINTER LODGE;&#xD;
&#xD;
had given place to evil, and was hushed and silent now&#xD;
as the scene around; while the gentle knockings of con-&#xD;
science, even as bird and .insect, sent not forth from his&#xD;
=q:     dark heart a single note of warning. He was plotting&#xD;
death to his enemies, and thought himself alone; but not&#xD;
far distant, crouching upon the ground, and stealing to-&#xD;
ward his recumlient figure with the stealthy steps of a&#xD;
panther, came on plotting his own. Unconscious of the&#xD;
danger threatening himself, Montlack continued silent&#xD;
and motionless,scheming only to secure the future; whilst&#xD;
his enemy, for'such his motions denoted him to be, now&#xD;
but, a few paces distant, rising cautiously to his feet, held&#xD;
aloft in his hand a glittering tomahawk, as if in the very&#xD;
act of springing forward, to change, by one blow, the&#xD;
supposed sleep of his victim to the unending slumber of&#xD;
death-&#xD;
"May the devil take me," muttered Montlack, at this&#xD;
moment, slightly moving his person, "if it ain't toQ bad to&#xD;
miss such an opportunity, and be balked in such a glo-&#xD;
rious plan of revenge, merely for the want of some cut-&#xD;
throat assistant, that I might purchase, soul and body, for&#xD;
a trifle, if only a little better acquainted in this infernal&#xD;
country !"&#xD;
The uplifted hatchet, but a moment since trembling&#xD;
to speed upon its bloody errand, was immediately low-&#xD;
ered at the sound of Montlack's voice, and a grim smile&#xD;
of surprise and pleasure passed over the fierce features of&#xD;
the assassin as he-heard this muttered regret of his in-&#xD;
tended victim.&#xD;
"Sacre /" again muttered Montlack, after a moment of&#xD;
silence, "I would willingly give a thousand dollars to&#xD;
meet now witi that damned bloody rascal, Simon Girty !"&#xD;
"You have but to speak of the .devil, Captain, and you&#xD;
know what the old saying is !" exclaimed a harsh, guttural&#xD;
voice, as if in answer to Montlack's earnest wish.&#xD;
Greatly amazed and terrified at this strange interruption,&#xD;
Montlack sprang quickly to his feet, and there, sure&#xD;
enough, immediately before him, stood the well-known&#xD;
formwof the renegade, still holding in his hand the un-&#xD;
sheathed tomahawk, and enjoying, with no little satisfac-&#xD;
tion, the dreadful fright of his old companion.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I claim the reward, Captain," said Girty, after laugh-&#xD;
ing outright at the ludicrous appearance 'of the terror-&#xD;
stricken Montlack, "for favoring you with this unex-&#xD;
pected pleasure. Remember, you offered a- thousand&#xD;
dollars for a look at my beautiful person, and now that&#xD;
you've got your wish, don't think of undervaluing the&#xD;
favor."&#xD;
"It's yours," exclaimed Montlack, recovering from his&#xD;
fright, although still trembling from the effect of the&#xD;
renegade's startling interruption ; "but how in the name&#xD;
of all that's wonderful came you here, and just at that&#xD;
moment when of all others I most desired your com-&#xD;
pany ?"&#xD;
"My presence came devilish nigh proving the death of&#xD;
Captain Montlack," growled Girty, "and had be not&#xD;
spoken just when he did, he would have never wagged&#xD;
tongue again. A moment later, and my tomahawk would&#xD;
have been buried in his brain."&#xD;
"Why, Girty 1" exclaimed Montlack, growing pale at&#xD;
the thought of his narrow escape, "you would not have&#xD;
murdered your old friend ?"&#xD;
"Not when .I heard his voice, and very kind wish for&#xD;
the presence of. one Simon Girty," replied the renegade,&#xD;
with mocking emphasis; "for then I knew him, and no&#xD;
longer mistook Captain Montlack for one of my sworn&#xD;
foes."&#xD;
"But how got you here, without arousing my atten-&#xD;
tion?" asked Montlack.&#xD;
"I thought you one of the borderers ; and knowing&#xD;
their quickness, stole upon fou as a cat upon her prey;&#xD;
but my caution was "unnecessary; for my usual step&#xD;
would not have reached your heavy ear. Take my advice,&#xD;
Captain, and never risk yourself alone in the woods&#xD;
again. It ain't every one that would lower his upraised&#xD;
tomahawk at the sound of your pleasant voice, and you&#xD;
stand no chance of a warning from the soft-treading hunt-&#xD;
ers of this country. . Why, blast me if a Wyandot or&#xD;
Shawanee, or even that damned scout, Simon Kenton,&#xD;
couldn't at any time take your scalp and you never be&#xD;
the wiser."&#xD;

&#xD;
"But you run a great frisk in remaining here, after&#xD;
what has occurred," said Montlack, in a tone between a&#xD;
warning and inquiry.  "You must be aware that the&#xD;
settlers have no love for Simon Girty, and would treat&#xD;
him as a wild beast did he again fall into their hands."&#xD;
"I'm not ignorant of their hatred, but- there's no love&#xD;
lost between us, and Simon Girty has not yet forgotten&#xD;
how to defend himself. But there is a little unsettled&#xD;
business between you and myself, Captain, and notwith-&#xD;
standing the danger, I have chosen to remain, and have&#xD;
been on the lookout for you ever since my escape."&#xD;
" True," replied Montlack, his face becoming a little&#xD;
troubled at the remembrance of his promises to the rene-&#xD;
gade; I believe there was something said about a thou-&#xD;
sand dollars I would owe you upon the fulfilment of cer-&#xD;
tain conditions on your part; but then you must remember,&#xD;
Girty, these conditions have not yet been performed, and&#xD;
I am not yet bound to fulfil my part of the agreement."&#xD;
Montlack ventured upon this reply with no little fear&#xD;
snd trembling, for he knew the desperate character of the&#xD;
outlaw, and expected some outbreak; but he dared the&#xD;
venture, hoping that he might thus, by disputing the&#xD;
matter, lower the claims of Girty, or if not, by at last&#xD;
submitting, show his generosity, especially as he never&#xD;
intended to make good his promises.&#xD;
"Captain Montlack's mind is somewhat forgetful,".said&#xD;
Girty, a flash of fury spreading over his face, and, in his&#xD;
rage, speaking calmly-although his hand rested in a&#xD;
threatening' manner upon the handle of his hatchet, as if&#xD;
half inclined to settle all amounts, with the death of his&#xD;
debtor ; "but he had 'better not attempt any of his tricks&#xD;
with Simon Girty, for I have a trick worth two of his ;&#xD;
and now let him acknowledge himself honestly my debtor&#xD;
for two thousand dollars, or damn me, if don't give him,&#xD;
an Indian receipt by taking his scalp in pay, and leaving&#xD;
his carcass to the vrlf and buzzard."&#xD;
"I have not denied my promise !" exclaimed the Cap-&#xD;
tain, hurriedly, for he saw plainly 'the outlaw was in a&#xD;
a4rngerous mood, and not to be crossed;- "but merely&#xD;
"  ade this suggestion, thinking, as our schemes had failed&#xD;
&#xD;
altogether, that you would not claim of me the entire&#xD;
amount."&#xD;
"Every cent," growled Girty, "for I did all that had to&#xD;
be done on my part ; and if the Indians were defeated,&#xD;
and the prisoners rescued, that's no fault of mine. I&#xD;
have never yet failed you, Captain Montlack," added the&#xD;
renegade, sternly, "and beware now that you do not fail&#xD;
Simon Girty, for he does not soon forget or forgive! I&#xD;
never break my promise, whether for good or evil, whether&#xD;
to save or destroy; nor do I permit those who have pro-&#xD;
mised me, to break theirs, and go unpunished."&#xD;
" You need not work yourself into a passion, Simon,"&#xD;
replied Montlack, hastening to remove all doubt from the&#xD;
mind of the renegade, " for if you claim the whole sum,&#xD;
then I have not a word to say; and what is still better&#xD;
for you, if you will only stand by me in a little scheme I&#xD;
have now on hand, and it proves successful-and there's&#xD;
no chance of its being otherwise with your assistance-&#xD;
then I promise you to double the amount of my indebt-&#xD;
edness, and at the same time insure you revenge upon an&#xD;
old enemy. A few thousands, more or less, is no object&#xD;
with me, Girty, so that my plans are successful.; but these&#xD;
cursed failures have soured me, and make me sometimes&#xD;
forgetful of the services of old friends."&#xD;
"It is rather dangerous for me to remain long in this&#xD;
neighborhood," said Girty, now completely mollified at&#xD;
the ready acquiescence of Montlack. to his demands,&#xD;
coupled, as it cunningly was, with the promise of a still&#xD;
greater reward; "but for the sake of an old friend, and&#xD;
to punish an enemy, if I can be of any assistance, you&#xD;
may count with certainty upon my services; provided,&#xD;
Captain, that to aid you will not detain me too long ii the&#xD;
vicinity of that. damned cunning scout, Simon Kenton."&#xD;
"Never fear him," replied Montlack, with a well-satis-&#xD;
fied smile:; "for, to my own certain knowledge, he has&#xD;
already started, or will, by to-morrow, be off upon a long&#xD;
scout, and Mefore his return we shall have done with his&#xD;
dear friends, and have nothing to fear from him."&#xD;
"0 ho! sets the wind on the same old trail?" ex-&#xD;
,claimed Girty, feeling more at ease, now that he had the&#xD;
assurance of the Scout's absence.&#xD;

himself and motioning with his hand for Girty to do the&#xD;
"Ad you please, Captaimgp returned tke renegade, seat-&#xD;
ing himself familiarly and without ceremony on the log&#xD;
by the side of Montlack, "but without presuming at all,&#xD;
I'd advise you to be as brief as possible; for if we are&#xD;
seen together, I would not give much for your scalp ;'&#xD;
Malden, or the Bloody-hand,' as the Indians call him,&#xD;
wouldn't think twice before he sent a bullet through you,&#xD;
if found in the company of Simon Girty."&#xD;
"He left me but a moment since," said.Montlack, look-&#xD;
ing quickly around as if but ill at ease, and somewhat&#xD;
startled by this caution from his companion.,&#xD;
"Then I'll be off at once," exclaimed Girty, rising has-&#xD;
tily to his feet, his countenance no longer easy or indif-&#xD;
ferent- "for I would as soon have the devil in my neigh-&#xD;
borho d as Jack Malden."&#xD;
"Theie's no danger of his company, for he has gone&#xD;
to the station, some miles distant, and will not, return&#xD;
before to-morrow," replied Montlack; "so be seated, and&#xD;
I'll explain my plan, and then you may be off as soon as&#xD;
you please! You may rest satisfied that I'll not detain&#xD;
you long, for your company is rather too dangerous to&#xD;
be enjoyed; and-I won't be sorry when we part:"&#xD;
Reassured, the renegade resumed his 'seat and listened&#xD;
without remark as Montlack explained his plan of re-&#xD;
venge, and made known the part he wished him to Play.&#xD;
More than once during .the recital, the outlaw bent his&#xD;
fierce gaze full upon the cunning face of his employer,&#xD;
as if he would fainread his s8ret thoughts, as he un-&#xD;
folded, step by step, h$ cold-blooded design; but when&#xD;
Montlack had conci ade4, no longetaeto restrain him-&#xD;
self, and while a bittei smile gathered around his stern&#xD;
mouth, Girty diuttere.&#xD;
"Men call Simon. Girty a heartless villain, and have&#xD;
set-aprice upon his head; but, damn me, if here is not a&#xD;
greater scoundrel than Simon Girty ever dare be; and&#xD;
yet, with the cunning smile of a devil he conceals the&#xD;
&#xD;
cloven foot, and remains honored and respected. Ha!&#xD;
ha 1" laughed the outlaw, mockingly; "you are my mas-&#xD;
ter, Captain ; your plan is a glorious one, and, with one&#xD;
thing added, must be successful."&#xD;
"What's that ?" inquired Montlack, quickly.&#xD;
"My co-operation !" growled' Girty.&#xD;
"You've promised it I" said Montlack, a little startled&#xD;
by the tone and manner of the renegade.&#xD;
"If you agree to my terms."&#xD;
" I have promised you two thousand, if successful."&#xD;
"Exactly !" said Girty, very coolly; "but I want some-&#xD;
thing more than your promise."&#xD;
"'What more do you desire ?"&#xD;
" I want this promise, and the consideration for it, in&#xD;
writing," returned Girty; "for I find your memory some-&#xD;
what slack respecting past agreements; and, to save all&#xD;
disputes hereafter, this one must be put down in black&#xD;
and white, or damn me if I raise hand or foot in this&#xD;
nice little affair."&#xD;
"It can't be done," said Montlack, unwilling to. place&#xD;
himself in the hands of Girty, by giving the writing re-&#xD;
quired, and at the sameltime fearful of refusing; "for I&#xD;
have neither pen, ink, nor paper; and your wish could&#xD;
not be satisfied, even if I were ever so willing."&#xD;
"It must and shall be !" replied the renegade, peremp-&#xD;
torily, "if you would have my assistance."&#xD;
"Then'be it so," said Montlack; "but you must wait&#xD;
until a more 'suitable time ; for to do so now, you see, is&#xD;
impossible:"&#xD;
SYou can take your own time, Captain," observed&#xD;
Girty, surlily; "but at the same time I give you.to under-&#xD;
stand that I will not make one move to aid you in your&#xD;
designs until I hive your promise, in writing, to pay&#xD;
me the sum agreed upon ; and the consideration I-re-&#xD;
member."&#xD;
Montlack, in making these promises to Girty, had never,&#xD;
intended to- fulfil them, and was'no little 'troubled now&#xD;
at this unexpected demand Qf the outlaw. He knew the&#xD;
danger of the step required of him by his stubborn ac-&#xD;

&#xD;
falling into the hands of any one of the settlers, it would&#xD;
secure his own certain destruction; and then, too, he was&#xD;
fearful of treachery; -and in case he should escape both of&#xD;
these evils, the Captain had a faint notion that he would&#xD;
somehow or other be compelled to pay the money, which&#xD;
:was by no means a very pleasant reflection. But seeing&#xD;
no escape, and Girty remaining firm, Montlack, with a&#xD;
faint thought of the trick he had played upon Head, run-&#xD;
nling in his mind, at last agreed to the unwelcome demand&#xD;
of the renegade, promising to deliver him the paper re-&#xD;
cjuired, at their next meeting.&#xD;
"Don't expect to trick me, Captain, as you did this Mr.&#xD;
Head," replied Girty, with a cunning leer, as if he had di.&#xD;
vined the thoughts of Montlack; "for you can't do it, and&#xD;
might run the risk of losing your scalp by the attempt."&#xD;
"I have never failed in my engagements with you yet,"&#xD;
said. Montlack, "and cannot imagine why you are now so&#xD;
cautious and suspicious.n&#xD;
"You've'never failed," laughed Girty, "because you've&#xD;
nevershad a chance; and I don't intend for you to fail&#xD;
now by giving you one. I run a great risk by remain-&#xD;
ing here to aid you; and am determined, if I do so, to&#xD;
have my pay .well secured, and run no risk on that&#xD;
score."&#xD;
"But as you have mentioned it," retorted Montlack,&#xD;
"suppose, when you present this writing for payment, I&#xD;
. should do you as I once did this fellow Head? What then?"&#xD;
"I don't depend upon your honesty at all," replied the&#xD;
renegade, bluntly; "and would as soon expect such treat-&#xD;
ment from you as anything else; but I have another hand&#xD;
behindctthis, and one Captain Montlack dare not meet."&#xD;
" What.is it?" inquired Montlack with some curiosity,&#xD;
for he was a little uneasy at the quiet and indifferent&#xD;
manner of his accomplice.&#xD;
"Suppose I should say it was this?" retorted Girty,&#xD;
holding up his, horny hand to the gaze of Montlack, and&#xD;
laughing at the joke.&#xD;
"A dangerous- hand to meet, I acknowledge," said&#xD;
Montlack, feigning to join in the merriment of the outlaw;&#xD;
"but is that your only dependence to insure my honesty?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Quite enough to secure prompt payment, or prompt&#xD;
punishment," growled Girty; "but, that Captain Mont-&#xD;
lack may see exactly how he stands, and never attempt&#xD;
any of his tricks with'me, I will give him to know that&#xD;
have still behind a stronger reason than the fear of per.&#xD;
sonal chastisement, to insure the performance of his pre-&#xD;
sent promises."&#xD;
"What is it ?" asked Montlack, becoming every mo-&#xD;
ment more anxious.&#xD;
"Has Captain Montlack lost a very valuable paper&#xD;
lately ?"&#xD;
"If so, he has not missed it," replied Montlack, his face&#xD;
becoming a little pale.&#xD;
"Let him examine, and I dare say he will discover his&#xD;
loss," was the cool remark of-the renegade.&#xD;
"You have not dared," exclaimed Montlack, his face&#xD;
becoming agitated with fear and passion, "to pry into or&#xD;
remove any of my private papers ?"&#xD;
"When you were a prisoner to the Shawanee, your&#xD;
papers were delivered into my hands for inspection,"&#xD;
replied Girty, with a cunning smile, "and among them I&#xD;
discovered one, not exactly yours, although in your pos-&#xD;
session; and that "I took the liberty of securing, merely to&#xD;
keep it safe, Captain, as it was very valuable, and I didn't&#xD;
know but what it might be useful to me upon some occa-&#xD;
sion.&#xD;
"And you've got it with you ?" exclaimed Montlack, a&#xD;
gleam of dark meaning gathering upon his face..&#xD;
"Not exactly with me, but I have it in a safe place,"&#xD;
replied the outlaw, with suspicious caution, hig hand&#xD;
quietly dropping upon the. handle of his tomahawk, as&#xD;
his eye caught the threatening look of his questioner.&#xD;
"And that paper was"-asked Montlack-&#xD;
"The will of General De Lacy, in favor of his daughter&#xD;
Coma, revoking a former one fhi your favor," said Girty,&#xD;
closely watching the motions of his companion.&#xD;
"Will you return it to me ?" asked Montlack, eagerly;&#xD;
"for it can be of no use to any one but the son of your&#xD;
old enemy."&#xD;

"Then go; and when you have secured me my revenge,&#xD;

"I doubt it not," muttered Girty, as he walked away;'&#xD;
"for you can't now help yourself.".&#xD;
"He knows too much," was the bitter exclamation of&#xD;
Montlack, as the renegade passed from his sight; "but if&#xD;
he knew even more," he added, with a threatening ges-&#xD;

kill bad man -hurt mamma."&#xD;
"Bless de:Lord!" laughed old Titus, showing his white&#xD;
teeth with delight, at the prattle of the child; "what will&#xD;
de boy be doing' next time ?"&#xD;
"Scalpin' the darned redskins, and scoutin' with old&#xD;
Simon;" said the. Scout, in his joy, tossing up the boy&#xD;
&#xD;
warrior, and catching him in his arms. "Blame me! if we&#xD;
don't make him 'the greatest hunter in all Kaintuck ;&#xD;
won't we, Bang ?"&#xD;
"I guess we will !" barked the dog, while, with a digni.&#xD;
fled air, he acknowledged the copartnership by looking&#xD;
'wisely into the bright face of the laughing child.&#xD;
"Gora'mighty !" muttered the black,. for he could&#xD;
never exactly understand Bang, and always seemed a&#xD;
little alarmed at his growling replies to the queries ofthQ&#xD;
Scout; "dis nigger b'lieve dat dog de devil, and Massa&#xD;
Simon better look out; for some of dese days, he take him&#xD;
down to de big fire and roast him, like* de dam Shawa-&#xD;
nee."&#xD;
"You hear that, Bang ?" said the Scout; "the black&#xD;
rascal thar' says you are a devil, and worse than an&#xD;
ingen."&#xD;
Whether it was the tone of his master, or his significant&#xD;
gesture in the direction of old Titus, or whether the dog&#xD;
actually understood the slanderous remark of the black,&#xD;
we are ignorant; but no sooner had the. Scout spoken,&#xD;
than Bang, bristling his hair, with a deep growl, showed&#xD;
his anger, and evident intent to resent the insult offered&#xD;
his dogship.&#xD;
"Bless de. Lord! Massa Simon," said Titus, quickly,&#xD;
and in evident terror; "what for'you say dat; de dam dog&#xD;
know ebery word you say, and be on dis nigger in no&#xD;
time, if you don't stop him."&#xD;
Do you still call him a devil?" said the Scout, a spark&#xD;
of humor playing around the corners of his mouth, as&#xD;
with a powerful grasp he detained the dog.&#xD;
"Me no call him debil," exclaimed Titus; " he ain't&#xD;
muffin' but a dam dog."&#xD;
"Down, Bang!" shouted Simon, laughing. with hearty&#xD;
delight at the superstitious terror of the negro; he as'&#xD;
taken back the charge, and you are no longer a devil,&#xD;
but a dog."&#xD;
Quick to obey the commands of his master,. Bang&#xD;
dropped his bristled hair at once, and quietly laid down&#xD;
at the feet of Simon; but, greatly to the annoyance of&#xD;

Titus, still kept his eye fastened sharply and knowingly&#xD;
upon the face of his slanderer.&#xD;
",If dat dog ain't de debil," muttered Titus, emphati.&#xD;
cally, but too low for the ears of Bang or his master,&#xD;
"den dis nigger gib up dat he jist know nuffin'. Whew!1"&#xD;
thought he to himself, "may-be dis child won't treat dat'.&#xD;

he muttered, with a great sinking lof the heart, at the dire&#xD;
thought; "won't he roast dis child for calling him de&#xD;
debil, when he want to pass for a dog ?"&#xD;
"Now, Titus,"4remarked the Scout, gravely putting on,&#xD;
or rather showing out in his true colors, for he was not&#xD;
wholly free from superstition himself, " what you've said&#xD;
agin Bang-ain't 'zactly right or perlite, and wer' very un-&#xD;
kind in an old friend; but may-be you wern't so far&#xD;
wrong, after all; for Mister Bryan told me one day, when&#xD;
we wer' out in the .hills together, and I wer' 'scribin'&#xD;
the strange sort of feelins what come over me sometimes&#xD;
when goin' to cut the throat of a wounded deer, that&#xD;
some people b'lieve that our spirits, when we die, jist&#xD;

after all; and that Bang, thar', for all he looks darned like&#xD;

transmigrated into a cur ?' It wouldn't be so cussed&#xD;
strange if he wer', for I've seen many a dog wrapped in&#xD;

"Gora'inighty! M assa Simon," exclaimed the black,&#xD;
his eyes rowing   1ith astonishment, "I wouldn't be&#xD;

"Dev l or man in dog skin,, I'll -ay this much for&#xD;

"I hope not," said Coma, in a low voice, for she had for&#xD;
a few minutes been an unseen and greatly amazed listener&#xD;
'to this metaphysical disquisition of the Scout and-Titus;&#xD;
"for if Sharp-Eye be caught sleeping, what wilt become&#xD;
of Master Bryan, and the rest of us&#xD;
Twilight had just given way before the silveryrays&#xD;
of night's great luminary, and this conversation between&#xD;
the Scout and Titus had been carried on whilst the two&#xD;
sat upon the door-sill in the open passage between-the&#xD;
rooms of Head and Duffe; Simon, during the time, hold-&#xD;
ing in his arms the little son of Coma-now riding him&#xD;
upon his knee, then answering his childish questions&#xD;
about the moon, ever and anon- varying these pleasant&#xD;
duties, by familiar intercourse with the honest black.&#xD;
Coma, coming out in search of her child, had, unseen by&#xD;
the wise disputants, and in their zeal quite unnoticed,&#xD;
been. standing 'immediately behind him, admiring the'&#xD;
bright face of her infant nursling in the arms of the&#xD;
brawny Scout; and, whilst thus standing, had heard Si-&#xD;
mon's philosophical remarks upon the dog, and Bang, in&#xD;
particular, interrupting his oath of the'latter's humanity&#xD;
in the manner we have-stated.&#xD;
"Never fear, Miss Coma," said the Scoutturing his&#xD;
head quickly, at the sound of her voice;  "Bangandme&#xD;
watch by turns, and have been too long scouting' together&#xD;
to be s'prised now by Creek, gjkawnee, or Wyandot."&#xD;
"Take care, Simon, and dgnot become careless because&#xD;
you have escaped so long," replied Coma, with kindly -&#xD;
terest, "and don't depend too much upon Bang; for&#xD;
though a good and brave dog, yet, after all, he is but a&#xD;
dog, and may fail you at some trying moment."&#xD;
"Bang fail me?" exclaimed Simon, laying his hanS1&#xD;
emphatically upon the rough, shaggy mane of his brute&#xD;
companion; "why, Miss Coma, I'd sleep sounder in the&#xD;
very country of an enemy, with Bang for my guard, than&#xD;
if surrounded by a hundred sentinels. You don't know&#xD;
Bang as I do, and ain't laid for hours and hours together&#xD;

to stand guard, or you wouldn't say that.. He never yit&#xD;
slept upon his post, and never yit has man or beast, crept&#xD;
upon our camp-fire without his giving the alarm. No,&#xD;
no; give me Bang for my companion, and I defy beast or&#xD;
Ingen toatch Simon Kenton asleep. Bang fail me, Miss&#xD;
Coma? you ain't past days and days, and weeks and&#xD;
weeks, with no other companion by day, or guard by&#xD;
night, or you wouldn't say that; and whenever he does,&#xD;
then the blasted redskins are jist. welcome to my scalp,&#xD;
for I wouldn't live any longer. Bang fail me? Why,&#xD;
who was it gave the alarm when the cunnin' Shawanee&#xD;
came crawlin' through the long grass upon the solitary&#xD;
camp-fire of Sharp-Eye?  Bang. And who, when the&#xD;
Creek warrior, decked in his horse-skin, grazed his way&#xD;
- 'long side of the sentinel, into our camp, first found out&#xD;
the spy? Bang. And who, when we wer' rushin' like&#xD;
fools right into the ambuscade of the Wyandots, seized&#xD;
ne by the leg, and held me back till I guessed somethin'&#xD;
were wrong, and by callin' a halt, saved our scalps?&#xD;
Bang. And who, when we wer' all lost in that blasted&#xD;
cave,-and had giv' up to die, led us out? Bang. I tell&#xD;
you, Miss Coma, if Bang ar' a dog, he jist knows more&#xD;
than mortals; and when Bang's dead, Simon Kenton will&#xD;
be no longerSharp-Eye.'&#xD;
Discovering from the eager defence of Simon, that she&#xD;
had unintentionally wounded his feelings by doubting&#xD;
the sagacity and faithfulness of his dog, Coma hurried at&#xD;
once to-remove all trace'of his anger, by playfully pat-&#xD;
ting B3ang upon the head and warmly praising his&#xD;
btvery and Wonderful watchfulness.&#xD;
"You may well say that," replied the Scout, com-&#xD;
pletely mollified by Coma's praise of his brute companion.&#xD;
"for thar' ain't no man, and not many dogs, like Bang;&#xD;
and though Miss Coma," he addedi,'with an arch look,&#xD;
"ain't slow to watch over Master gan-and I dare say,&#xD;
is even now on the hunt of niim-I'd jist rather trust&#xD;
Bang to guard himagin danger than her. What do you&#xD;
say, Titus?"&#xD;
"Gor'mig i   I'se jist got nuffin' to say," exclaimed&#xD;
the black, not wishing either to join against his mistress,&#xD;
&#xD;
or incur the present or future displeasure of the dog, or&#xD;
devil; foi- to which of these two titles Bang had the best&#xD;
claim, old Titus was not yet entirely able to determine;&#xD;
though, as all men should do in cases of difficulty, he&#xD;
had split the difference, by thinking if he was =not the&#xD;
devil, he was at any rate a devil of a dog.&#xD;
Laughing good-humoredly at the Scout's great confi-&#xD;
dence in his dog, Coma asserted her own superior watch-&#xD;
fulness, by taking little Bryan from his arms, saying, as&#xD;
she turned to move away-&#xD;
-"Sharp-Eye and Bang are guards sufficient for any&#xD;
treasure; but I hold,-Simon, that a mother's eye is even&#xD;
more watchful than scout or dog. 'Tis time now, Master&#xD;
Bryan was in his cradle, and.I feel better content when&#xD;
I I have him under my own vision; but mind, Simon," she&#xD;
added, shaking -her finger good-naturedly, "I don't mean&#xD;
any disrespect to Monsieur Bang."&#xD;
"Bang's a gentleman, and can't be insulted by a lady,"&#xD;
returned the Scout, in the same pleasant tone, "and Miss&#xD;
Coma needn't fear, for we'll watch close over her and&#xD;
hers."&#xD;
A grateful smile was Coma's only reply.&#xD;
"Hi! hiI" chuckled old Titus, when his mistress was&#xD;
gone, still suspiciously eyeing Bang; " Missus needn't&#xD;
trouble herself 'bout you needer; for I 'ze always hearn&#xD;
say, Massa Simon, dat de debil will take care of him's&#xD;
own."&#xD;
An hour later, all the inhabitants of the station; with&#xD;
the exception of Coma and her child, were gathered, as&#xD;
was a usual thing with them, around the fireside of Du1e.&#xD;
The Scout was busy moulding bullets, whilst Titus was&#xD;
as busy heading and preparing them for use; and Bryan&#xD;
and the Sergeant, conversing together, watched the mo-&#xD;
tions of their industrious companions.&#xD;
"Do you tink, Massa Simon," inquired the black, in a&#xD;
low tone, with a cautious glance around to see whether&#xD;
'other ears were listening, "you'll see datvhite doe agin',&#xD;
and hab no better luck dis tine, 'dan de1~st&#xD;

happen, without first seem' her. She seems to come' alb&#xD;
ways, when I'm most in need of food, for all the world&#xD;
as= if she would tempt me to shoot, merely to laugh at,&#xD;
the besyshot in the settlement.  I'll shoot at her no&#xD;
more, I'm 'tarmined on that; for she's a witch or some-&#xD;
thin' worse to a sartainty, and Sharp-Eye ain't going' to&#xD;
ruin the character of old Betsy onsich a blasted critter."&#xD;
"I'ze hearn say," returned Titus, this time resting his&#xD;
eye for a moment,. with a look of doubt, upon the quiet&#xD;
face of the seeping dog, "dat witches"and ghosts, and all&#xD;
dem kind of tings, may be shot wid silver bullets, or wid&#xD;
one dat wer' never moulded, but chewed wid de teeth.&#xD;
'Spose you try him, Massa Simon, and see what he do&#xD;
den?"&#xD;
It won't do 1" said the Scout, shaking his head;&#xD;
"I've tried both, and it wer' all the same. The white doe&#xD;
didn't care any more for silver bullet, than one of lead.&#xD;
No, nod she may dome as often as she pleases now, but&#xD;
blast meif I ever raise old Betsy again the critter again '&#xD;
"what's that you say, Simon ?" asked Bryan, who, un-&#xD;
noticed by the busy couple, had been listening to the&#xD;
strangestory of Kenton. "Is it possible that Sharp-Eye&#xD;
has missed his mark so often ?"&#xD;
"Mister Bryan knows," said the Scout, with gloomy&#xD;
emph asis, "that Sharp-Eye never yit missed his aim, when&#xD;
old Betsy wer' pointed at anything mortal; but what's&#xD;
the use- of shootin' at. a thing no bullet can touch, and&#xD;
what ain't to be killed by mortal man?"&#xD;
"Surely, you don't believe any such thing ?" said&#xD;
Bryan, touched by the sad look and mournful tones of&#xD;
the old hunter.&#xD;
II jist don't know what to b'lieve, Mister Bryan; but&#xD;
this much I do know, that I've seen this white doe more&#xD;
than once, and never without.some; misfortune happening'&#xD;
either to myself or some .fried, shortly after; and I've&#xD;
shot at her time after time, at point-blank distance, off-&#xD;
hand and attest with silver and leaden bullet, and never&#xD;
yit has she appeared even frightened at the shot. No,&#xD;
no!.I'll shoot at her no more; on that I'm 'tarmined,&#xD;
&#xD;
for she ain't to be killed by mortal man, and what's the&#xD;
use of tryin'?"&#xD;
"You've had the buck ague!" laughed Bryan, "or&#xD;
you've become so greatly the prey of your superstitious&#xD;
fears, that your hand has become unsteady; and this is&#xD;
the cause of your failure, and not that the doe bears a&#xD;
charmed life."&#xD;
"Not at all; my nerves wer' never more steady. I'de&#xD;
wager all I'm worth, that, both before, at the time, and&#xD;
immediately after firing at this 'ere witch or devil, or&#xD;
whatever it may be, at seventy paces off-hand, I could&#xD;
strike a dollar; as I've often done, from the fingers of&#xD;
Titus, and never raise the skin."&#xD;
"'Tis strange !" muttered Bryan, becoming insensibly&#xD;
affected at the wild story of the Scout; "but when saw&#xD;
you this white doe last ?"&#xD;
"No longer ago than this morning, and only some mile&#xD;
or more away in the hills !" replied Kenton, with an&#xD;
uneasy glance around, and in a dogged, gloomy tone.&#xD;
"Did you fire at it ?"&#xD;
"Twice; and in as calm and cool amanner as I ever&#xD;
drew trigger in my life, and yet she bounded away un-&#xD;
touched. I've made up my mind, Mister Bryan, never to&#xD;
do the like aging; and nothin' now will tempt me ever to&#xD;
raise old Betsy to take the life of that doe."&#xD;
"And you say some misfortune has always followed&#xD;
the appearance of this strange animal ?" said Bryan,&#xD;
musingly, a cloud gathering upon his brow.&#xD;
"Always, either to myself or some of my friends," re-&#xD;
plied Simon; "and so sartain am I that sich will now be&#xD;
the case, that, when I think of it, I almost dread to start&#xD;
upon my scout."&#xD;
"I trust.that you may return to us safe and well!" mut&#xD;
tered Bryan, scarce knowing, so deep was his reverie,&#xD;
that he had. made anyremark.&#xD;
"If misfortun' or danger is hangin' over myself; I care&#xD;
plaguey little about it," replied the Scout, with more&#xD;
spirit and animation than he had yet spoken. "It's on&#xD;
account of them I leave behind I'm troubled."&#xD;

listlessness by the generous and unselfish reply of the no-&#xD;
ble-hearted borderer; "for here at the station, we are in&#xD;
 safety, and no injury can reach us; but be mindful of&#xD;
yourself; for you go upon a long and dangerous journey,&#xD;
where fierce enemies will seek 'your life, and dangers of&#xD;
every kind beset your path,. and .it 'is for you alone that&#xD;
there is any cause of fear."&#xD;
"Bang. and me will go forth upon our lonely journey&#xD;
without a thought of danger; for we've dared the terrors&#xD;
ofsaxight, and forest, and savage. foe, too often to have&#xD;
any dread of 'em  now. But sorrow and death is a&#xD;
strange thing, Mister Bryan, and comes when we ain't&#xD;
lookin' for it, and when there's no reason for 'spectin' it.&#xD;
I've known men to pass through bloody battles without a&#xD;
scratch; have seen 'em 'scape from danger after danger,&#xD;
as if bearin' a charmed life, and at last be killed when&#xD;
they thought they wer':in perfect safety, and .had every&#xD;
reason to' consider 'emselves free from all' danger and&#xD;
every chance of injury. No, no! have no fear for me;&#xD;
for I've carried mylife in my own hands for these many&#xD;
years, and he that would take it now, must be- both bold&#xD;
and cunnin' to get the better of Sharp-Eye and Bang.&#xD;
Have a care for yourself and them I leave behind at the&#xD;
station, Mister Bryan; for that ar' blasted doe crossin' my&#xD;
path as she did this morning , tells of some deviltry on&#xD;
hand, and I'd, be only too glad to think it wer' coming' to&#xD;
myself 'sted of any one else."&#xD;
"The day of omens has passed," said Bryan, in a more&#xD;
cheerful tone, struggling to throw off the gloom produced&#xD;
by the Scout's strange story, "and the presence of the&#xD;
white doe can portend -nothing. I'd wager now, Simon,"&#xD;
he add d, with a forced laugh, "that she would never stand&#xD;
up under my fire; and I'd like right well 'to put an end to&#xD;
.your idle fear, by sending a bullet through the heart of&#xD;
this charmed witch  of the forest, and bringing home her&#xD;
fair hide to ornament the lodge of Coma."&#xD;
Kenton make no reply to this sally of Bryan, merely&#xD;
shaking his headunbelievingly; then turning once more&#xD;
to his bullet&amp;amp;ind lead, evidently wished to drop the dis-&#xD;
agreeable suhect.&#xD;
&#xD;
For half an hour longer, Simon and Titus continued their&#xD;
occupation; -Bryan, during this period, gazing with rest-&#xD;
less look into the flaming fire, whilst Mrs. Duffe and the&#xD;
Sergeant sat in silence ; the former -plying, with rapid&#xD;
hand, her yarn and needle, the latter vacantay regarding&#xD;
the movements of the Scout and'negro.&#xD;
At length, Titus, carelessly seizing, by mistake, a bul-&#xD;
let hot and steaming from the mould, threw it quickly&#xD;
down, and broke the long silence that had gathered over&#xD;
the little party, 'y exclaiming, as he blew upon the ends&#xD;
of his fingers-&#xD;
"He dam hot! mass Simon; ain't you got 'nul 'for&#xD;
dis time ?"&#xD;
Simon, with a smile spreading over his face at the mis-&#xD;
hap of his sable companion, made no reply to his query,&#xD;
other than to throw to one side his ladle, and deposit in&#xD;
his pouch his bullet-mould, this beings considered, both&#xD;
by himself and interrogator, as answer sufficient.&#xD;
"If we are to judge as to the length of your scout by&#xD;
the quantity of ammunition prepared," remarked Duffe,&#xD;
addressing Kenton, "it -will be some time before we see&#xD;
you agai. . You have bullets enough, without counting&#xD;
that hot one dropped by Titus, to last you through a six&#xD;
months' campaign."&#xD;
"I always like-to set out well prepared," replied Si-&#xD;
mon, "and a bullet don't come amiss on a long scout. I&#xD;
don't know what may turn up before I git back; and&#xD;

"But, will you be long absent from the station ?"-asked&#xD;

to pass over certain distances. -&#xD;

"But why not' t-ai the river on the north, and then&#xD;

"butif Captain Montlack is no more to be feared than&#xD;

torted Simon, slightly ruffled at the light manner in&#xD;
whichnDuffe had treated his fears; "and when too late to&#xD;

warnin'.".&#xD;
"As to the white doe," said the matter-of-fact Sergeant,&#xD;

'1He never leave till he has had revpn n-d wl1 be&#xD;

his musings by the excited voice of the Scout, had been&#xD;
listening to his warning, "but you need not fear; for,&#xD;
knowing our enemy as we do, we shall be on our guard,&#xD;
and Captain Montlack will have to be more cunning than&#xD;
I am disposed to give him credit for, if he catches us&#xD;
napping in his dangerous vicinity."&#xD;
"Gora'mighty," exclaimed Titus, who had been* a&#xD;
silent listener to the conversation of his master, and had&#xD;
discovered the cause of their secret uneasiness "what for&#xD;
you be troubled? If Massa Bryan jist say de wod;, dis&#xD;
child take- de dam Capting's scalp, and him den sleep,&#xD;
and no fear dis mulatter any more."&#xD;
"The best thing that could be done," muttered Simon,&#xD;
coolly; "for the cussed skunk won't fight like a man, and&#xD;
deserves to be scalped by a nigger."&#xD;
After a few minutes' earnest conversation, during&#xD;
which it was arranged that Bryan and Duffe should accom-&#xD;
pany the Scout some distance upon his first day's journey,&#xD;
the former left the room and retired to bed. Duffe soon&#xD;
after showing by his movements that he too was prepar-&#xD;
ing for sleep, Simon, as was his usual custom  on the,&#xD;
night prior to setting out on one of his scouting ex pi-&#xD;
tions, whistled to Bang- and, accompanied by his  .&#xD;
and Titus (for the latter had rather a penchant for camp .&#xD;

ing out on a small scale), retired to the yard, where he&#xD;
spent-the remainder ofthe night, sleeping upon the&#xD;
ground beneath the open sky, wrapped in his blanket, to&#xD;
prepare himself, as he was wont to say, for the approach-&#xD;
ing campaign. Simon and Titus slept soundly enough;&#xD;
but Bang, who kept watch and ward, at one period of the&#xD;
night became restless and uneasy, often bristling up his&#xD;
hair, and emitting low growls, as if conscious of the pre-&#xD;
sence of some enemy. At last, as if fully satisfied of the&#xD;
approach of some danger, and of the necessity of giving&#xD;
the alarm, he sprang forward with a fierce bark; and as&#xD;
he did so, a head, that had been cautiously peering over&#xD;
the picket. fence, was drawn quickly back, and its owner,&#xD;
dropping lightly to the ground, stole cautiously away into&#xD;
the woods.&#xD;
Alarmed by the warning oice of Bang, the Shout,&#xD;
rifle in hand, was on' his feetrin a moment; but seeing&#xD;
nothing, after a few minutes of quiet survey, he again&#xD;
flung himself upon the ground, muttering, as he prepared&#xD;
for sleep-&#xD;
"Only a sneakin' wolf, Bang, but thar's no danger from&#xD;
varmints here. Down, old fellow !" he added drowsily,&#xD;
seeing the dog still restless, "'tis nothin', and you'd bet-&#xD;
ter sleep; for once outside of the picket, and we won't git&#xD;
much rest for some time to come."&#xD;
The prowling wolf had fled; and Bang and his master&#xD;
slept quietly.&#xD;
CHAPTER        XVII.&#xD;
"A bloody villain, and treacherous, is this dear Cap-&#xD;
tain of mine,". muttered Girty, a few days after the&#xD;
departure of Kenton from the station, as ;he-journeyed&#xD;
leisurely along through the forest on his way to a meet-&#xD;
ing with Montlack, "and he would be dangerous too,&#xD;
had he 'only courage ,equal to his rascality. But 'he pays&#xD;
well; and. damn te diference," muttered~ the renegade,&#xD;
&#xD;
01, VOW FULFILLED.           207&#xD;
&#xD;
with a satisfied air, "so long as he does the honest thing&#xD;
with me; and he can't help himself now, for I have. him&#xD;
in my power, and he knows it; and what's still bettei,&#xD;
I'm going to keep him there; for, may the devil take me&#xD;
if he shall ever handle the old General's will again, so&#xD;
long as I can squeeze a cent out of him."&#xD;
Laughing to himself at the happy thought of thus&#xD;
holding Montlack in his power, and well pleased with&#xD;
the prospect of as golden harvest ahead, the renegade&#xD;
continued his journey. He moved now with greater&#xD;
caution than he had yet exhibited, rapidly scanning, as&#xD;
he went the forest, before and around him, and with the&#xD;
quick rolling glance of one accustomed to wood life, and&#xD;
as if fully conscious of the danger of a chance meeting&#xD;
with some wandering hunter.&#xD;
"A devilish good place this for an ambuscade," he&#xD;
muttered, halting in a deep narrow dell, covered with&#xD;
thick undergrowth, and viewing it with a critical eye,&#xD;
"but that sort of business is all over now, and my last&#xD;
expedition to Kentucky has proven rather a losing one&#xD;
to my savage friends. But never mind," he continued in a&#xD;
consolatory tone, "it's an ill wind, as the old saying goes,&#xD;
that dent blow some one good, and damn me if I don't&#xD;
think I'll make something of it yet. They're getting&#xD;
too strong for us here now, and the spoils of a few small&#xD;
stations won't pay for the danger of a brush with the&#xD;
settlers, and I for one don't intend to run my head into&#xD;
the halter again. Let this Captain of mine but come&#xD;
down pretty freely with his cash, and though the devils&#xD;
killed and scalped all my Shawanee friends, I guess I'll&#xD;
play quits with them, and be off. I had my revenge at&#xD;
the Blue Licks; and plenty of gold," he added, with a&#xD;
low, unfeeling laugh, "will soon wipe out all recollection&#xD;
of my redskin brothers. But .come ! before I see the&#xD;
Captain, let me think a little, for he's as slippery as an&#xD;
eel; and blast him, even if he did play the traitor, I&#xD;
couldn't kill him, for then I'd lose all chance of his gold,&#xD;
and only have the scalp of a coward in place of his&#xD;
money.' 'Honor among thieves!' there's no truth in that&#xD;
old saying; for a rascal is honest no longer than it is his&#xD;

&#xD;
interest to be so. At any rate, I'll trust the Captain's&#xD;
honesty no farther than his interest goes. But let me&#xD;
think."&#xD;
And the renegade, seating himself, silently ran over in&#xD;
his mind his own schemes and plans, and at the same&#xD;
time the probable designs of his employer; ever and anon,&#xD;
as some thoughts would forcibly strike him, bursting out&#xD;
with a bitter exclamation or hoarse laugh; and then again&#xD;
sinking back to silence with a heavy, frowning brow, he&#xD;
would inwardly contemplate his own treacherous heart,&#xD;
fancying the reflection he saw there, but a picture of the&#xD;
deceit he feared at the hands of Montlack.&#xD;
"A damned villain, sure enough," he at length mut-&#xD;
tered, clothing his thoughts with words ; "as bad, if not&#xD;
worse than I am myself. I am Simon Girty, the renegade,&#xD;
and fugitive from his country, the ally of the savage,&#xD;
and detested foe of my own race, and don't pretend to&#xD;
be anything else ; but he, damn him, is just as bad, and&#xD;
gets himself up for a gentleman, while all the time he's&#xD;
creeping about, engaged in some rascality, and has been&#xD;
a traitor ever since he set foot in the country, and no&#xD;
one's the wiser. But never mind! he can't deceive me;&#xD;
and I have him bound by the only tie that will hold a&#xD;
villain-his interest. Ha! ha! he forgot, did he?  But&#xD;
he can't forget now, even if he wished. I have some-&#xD;
thing in my hands that will keep him in remembrance,&#xD;
and make the name of Simon Girty a dread sound in his&#xD;
ears as long as h#lives. Let him but give me that little&#xD;
paper; and curse me if I make a move until he does,&#xD;
then, for the sake of his gold and revenge, I'll finish this&#xD;
little job on hand, and it's easy enough, now that blasted&#xD;
Scout has gone; but when once finished, Simon Girty is&#xD;
off for Canada, to live like a gentleman, and without&#xD;
another meeting with honest Captain Jean. Ha! ha?&#xD;
once I've done this business for him, it won't do to trust&#xD;
myself any longer in his hands; for the least hint of my&#xD;
presence to 'Bloody-handed Malden' would be certain&#xD;
death. Ay, I see my way clear enough now ; so here&#xD;
goes for my last meeting with my dear friend; and may&#xD;
&#xD;
the devil take me if it won't be a meeting between two&#xD;
precious villains."&#xD;
Starting up, the renegade hastily resumed his journey,&#xD;
not forgetting, as he hurried along to the appointed ren-&#xD;
dezvous, his usual caution and watchfulness. Montlack&#xD;
was before him, and, as Girty drew aside, with the prac-&#xD;
tised hand of an expert woodsman, the matted limbs- of&#xD;
some taigled undergrowth, and peered cautiously out,&#xD;
he beheld the Captain, sitting upon the trunk of an over-&#xD;
thrown tree, and apparently buried in deep thought; for&#xD;
his gun lay by his side, and his face sunk in his hands,&#xD;
gave token of his indifference to all external things, and&#xD;
expressed a carelessness to danger that, in the mind of&#xD;
the renegade, could only be ascribed to his total ignorance&#xD;
of border life.&#xD;
"Ha_! Captain," he shouted, laying his hand heavily&#xD;
upon the shoulder of Montlack; "gone to sleep again !&#xD;
Why damn it, man, won't you never learn any caution?&#xD;
I wouldn't give a button for your scalp, if you stay much&#xD;
longer in this country, and sleep on your post in this&#xD;
manner. The veriest lubber in the settlement could brain&#xD;
you, and Captain Jean Montlack be none the wiser."&#xD;
Provided the brain is the seat of sense, and the opera-&#xD;
tion mentioned by the renegade had been skillfully per-&#xD;
formed upon the musing Captain, we doubt not but the&#xD;
latter clause of his remark would have been true; but&#xD;
Montlack, starting up in alarm, was not in a proper state&#xD;
of mind for a metaphysical argumentand so met the&#xD;
salutation of the outlaw by exclaiming, in an angry&#xD;
tone-&#xD;
" Why don't you give some notice of your approach;&#xD;
and why are you forever startling one in this abrupt way?&#xD;
Have you been long present ?" he added, with a suspicious&#xD;
glance at the dark countenance of the renegade.&#xD;
"Not long enough," retorted Girty, as'if divining his&#xD;
thoughts, "to hear any of Captain Montlack's cunning&#xD;
schemes; so you may rest easy, and we'll to, business."&#xD;
"Well, what say you now ?" exclaimed Montlack, his&#xD;
suspicions of Girty removed by this blunt reply;. "can&#xD;

&#xD;
my plan be executed, so as not to fail, and secure me&#xD;
revenge?"&#xD;
Not so fast, Captain," muttered Girty; "there's some-&#xD;
thing to be done by you, before I answer your question."&#xD;
"What is it ?" said Montlack, a slight cloud gathering&#xD;
upon his brow.&#xD;
"That little paper you promised me ; I would like to&#xD;
see whetherit's all right, before we go any further."&#xD;
"Can't you tryst in my promise ?" saidMontlack.&#xD;
"A promise is a promise; and business is business,"&#xD;
growled Girty; "and if you want any information from&#xD;
me, you must first hand over the paper."&#xD;
"You doubtmy honesty !" suggested Montlack.&#xD;
"Damn your honesty !" muttered Girty, "I don't doubt&#xD;
it, when you find honesty is your best policy ; but I&#xD;
haven't forgot the trick you played upon this fellow, Head;&#xD;
so out with the paper, if you have it; and if not, then&#xD;
that's the end of the matter, and we part company at&#xD;
once."&#xD;
Seeing that the renegade was determined upon having&#xD;
his bond before he would answer any question, Montlack&#xD;
with reluctance slowly drew it from his pocket, and with&#xD;
a sigh handed it over.&#xD;
"All right !" muttered Girty; but not until "he had&#xD;
twice slowly and cautiously read the. obligation of Mont-&#xD;
lack, and closely scrutinized the signature. "I find you&#xD;
have done the fair thing, Captain, and am now at your&#xD;
service."&#xD;
"A fair exchange is no robbery," said Montlack, with&#xD;
a miserable attempt at pleasantry; 'and as you have my&#xD;
bond, suppose you return me that little paper of mine;&#xD;
it can be1of no use to you.now, and remember, you pro-&#xD;
mised that you would do so, when I delivered you my&#xD;
obligation."&#xD;
"I remember no such promise ;" replied Girty, em-&#xD;
phatically, "nor does Captain Montlack."&#xD;
"But it can be of no benefit to you now," urged Mont-&#xD;
lack; "for you have my bond,, and I have never yet failed&#xD;
to make good my premise."&#xD;
"No proof that you never will !" sneered the renegade,&#xD;
&#xD;
"and as to it's being of no use to me, I have my own&#xD;
views on that subject, and think it my only security for&#xD;
the payment of the obligation you-have just given me."&#xD;
" But will you ever return it ?" inquired Montlack, with&#xD;
some anxiety.&#xD;
"When you:pay off the bond !"&#xD;
"But what security have I, that you will then do so ?"&#xD;
"My word !" laughed Girty,."the word of a renegade&#xD;
and murderer. Ain't that enough, Captain ?"&#xD;
Montlack muttered something in reply ;to which the&#xD;
renegade growled in answer-&#xD;
"Damn the other security you'll ever get, so you might&#xD;
as well make up your mind at once, Captain; for -you'll&#xD;
never see the General's will again, 'till you down with the&#xD;
gold; you have my word for that. Knowing you as I do,&#xD;
I'm not fool -enough to give up the will and permit Cap-&#xD;
tain Montlack to deny this little paper, as he did the one&#xD;
given Head; or swear in some of the courts, where Simon&#xD;
Girty dare not appear, that it was executed to' save his&#xD;
scalp, or escape from captivity. Ha! ha! Captain! did&#xD;
I strike you then ?" laughed the renegade, seeing the Cap-&#xD;
tain wince, as he suggested the defence he might make;&#xD;
"you see I'm no fool when money is at stake."&#xD;
"Well, have it as you will!" said Montlack, with a cun-&#xD;
ning smile, "for it matters very little with me. I intend&#xD;
to pay off the obligation when presented, and as you will&#xD;
then hand over the will, it is of very little consequence,&#xD;
and not worth a quarrel between -old endss"&#xD;
"Exactly !" said Girty, with cool indifference; "I knew,&#xD;
when you thought over the matter, you wouldn't think&#xD;
hard of my keeping the will, merely as a security, you&#xD;
know; for when the money is paid, it will be of no fur-&#xD;
ther value to me."&#xD;
"None in the world," said Montlack, quickly;."but&#xD;
now let me know what's the chance of my getting clear&#xD;
of this Mr. Head?"&#xD;
"It's just as certain now as that you and me are two of&#xD;
the greatest scoundrels alive !" replied Girty, with a low&#xD;
chuckle at his more truthful thaPolite asseveration.&#xD;
" But'how have you arranged At" said Montlack, his&#xD;

face brightening up at this- positive assurance of his ac-&#xD;
coimplice.&#xD;
"Is there no danger of that prying Scout marring our&#xD;
plot?"&#xD;
"None in the world, for I've trailed him beyond the&#xD;
settlements, and he'll not return for manyweeks."&#xD;
"Let him go1" hissed .Montlack, a gleam of hatred&#xD;
passing over his face, "and would to. God somesavage&#xD;
or wild beast would forever prevent his return. I have&#xD;
an old score gainst him, and would like right well to&#xD;
wipe it out now while my hands are in; but as he is gone,&#xD;
in the devil's name let him go!"&#xD;
"Amen !" growled Girty, "but take the advice of one&#xD;
just now interested in your welfare, Captain; and when&#xD;
this little job we have on hand is finished, don't let' the&#xD;
grass grow under your feet between this and the old&#xD;
State."&#xD;
"You think this Scout will prove a dangerous enemy,&#xD;
do you ?" replied Montlack, with the slightest possible&#xD;
sneer.&#xD;
"If you dont," said Girty, bluffly, "then you are a&#xD;
much greater fool than I took you to be. Simon Kenton,&#xD;
when he returns and finds his friends'murdered, will be&#xD;
like a lioness over her lost whelps, and let those that have&#xD;
done the injury beware of his teeth. With less than five&#xD;
hundred miles between me and him, I wouldn't have this&#xD;
damn Scout upon my trail, for double the amount you&#xD;
have promised me.&#xD;
"Never'fear!" replied Montlack, "I'll take good care of&#xD;
myself. Now let me know how you. have arranged it,&#xD;
that suspicion will fall certainly upon' my enemies?"'&#xD;
"It is all easy enough, now that the Scout has gone ;&#xD;
and what I would not have dared to do had he and that&#xD;
cursed-dog of his remained' at the station, can be done&#xD;
now without any danger, and makes the thing certain."&#xD;
"Sacre!" exclaimed the Captain, with a gesture of im-&#xD;
patience; "go on,. and tell me what you propose."&#xD;
"I propose nothing 1" said the renegade, surlily; "it is&#xD;
you thit proposes."&#xD;
Doyou wish to ma xe mad?" shouted Montlack&#xD;
&#xD;
"I have no such an intention," laughed Girty; "for I&#xD;
don't want you to be non compos-when I present that&#xD;
little bond of yours."&#xD;
"Then tell me your scheme for bringing down the&#xD;
vengeance of Maidenand his friends upon my enemies at&#xD;
the station, and do so at once; for my patience was never&#xD;
very great, and at present I have less than usual."&#xD;
"The scheme is a cunning one, and bound to succeed,&#xD;
Captain; but you deserve all the praise for its concoction,&#xD;
and I only lay the train for you to explode. I've been&#xD;
to the stables of Major Malden, and know exactly what&#xD;
to do there ; I've also been to the station, and find that&#xD;
your enemies keep their horse-gear in the open passage&#xD;
between the two cabins, and so to-night I intend to go&#xD;
there; for, the Scout and his dog gone, there's no danger."&#xD;
"And what will you do?" exclaimed Montlack, inter-&#xD;
rupting him.&#xD;
"I'll take a bridle and some other well-known articles&#xD;
of horse-trapping, then away to Malden's, and steal his&#xD;
favorite horse."&#xD;
"And what then ?"&#xD;
"I'll take him to the little valley at the east side of&#xD;
the station, and fasten him up with the stolen bridle; and&#xD;
the other articles I may lay my hands on, I will scatter&#xD;
around, s6 as to increase suspicion."&#xD;
" And then what?"&#xD;
"I'll make a trail from the horse to the gate of the&#xD;
station."&#xD;
"And then ?"&#xD;
"And then I'll leave the matter in your haqds," growled&#xD;
the renegade, "and I think it won't stop there."&#xD;
"It couldn't be better !" exclaimed Montlack, "and&#xD;
they are safe enough now; but how about the trail from&#xD;
Maiden's ?"&#xD;
"For some two or three hundred paces from the stable,&#xD;
I'll carefully conceal the trail; but do you remember the&#xD;
tall tree shivered by lightning about that distance, imme-&#xD;
diately south ?"&#xD;
Montlack nodded his head.&#xD;

"Let Malden summon' those fools -that so sillily took&#xD;

scowl shading his fierce features-&#xD;
"My enemies shall know the fate of those who balk&#xD;
the plans of Jean Montlaek 1" hissed the Oaptain between&#xD;
his teeth.&#xD;
"In other words, be numbered with the dead!" said&#xD;
Girty, with a fiendish laugh.&#xD;
"Ay t the hunt will then be up, and the game. run&#xD;
down."&#xD;
"And Captain Jean Montlack," sneered the renegade,&#xD;
"satisfied with his bloody revenge, and secure in the pro.&#xD;
perty of General De Lacy, will spend the remainder of&#xD;
his days in peace, honored and esteemed by the gaping&#xD;
worshippers of wealth, and die"-&#xD;
".As he has. lived !" muttered Montlack, intermipting&#xD;
himo.&#xD;
"A hypocrite tosthe last," growled Girty.&#xD;
" And, Simon Girty," retorted Montla k, aggravated&#xD;
beyond endiance ,at the bitter irony of the renegade,&#xD;
"what will be-his fate ?'&#xD;
-" Secured from want brythe liberality of his employer,&#xD;
he will seek a home in the kingdom of king George."&#xD;

&#xD;
distorting his dusky countenance, "a renegade and trai4&#xD;
tor to his country; but an open and avowed one, cursing&#xD;
his enemies and his race to the last !"&#xD;
A short space of silence followed this bitter outbreak;&#xD;
but at length the renegade, shouldering his rifle; as if in&#xD;
preparation for his departure, exclaimed, in a harsh and&#xD;
threatening voice-&#xD;
"I go now, Captain, to perform my part of the con-&#xD;
tract ; and, remember, when I present your bond for pay-&#xD;
ment, there must be no shrinking on your part ! You&#xD;
may live and die a hypocrite, and, for aught. I care, a&#xD;
traitor to allthe world ; but beware the day when you&#xD;
deceive Simon Girty.. Once false to me, FIl have re~&#xD;
avenge, though a lifetime roll away between the hour of&#xD;
injury and day of reckoning."&#xD;
"And remember ! I must have back that will," re-&#xD;
torted Montlack.&#xD;
Ay! Pll remember it," replied Girty, walking away,&#xD;
"and I guess," -he added to himself when beyond the&#xD;
hearing of Montlack, "there will be somebody else that&#xD;
won't forget it :soon."&#xD;
"There hegoes!"muttered Montlack, "the thick-skulled&#xD;
fool! to think himself able to match Jean Montlack in&#xD;
cunning ! Ha! ha ! I wonder if he really thinks -intend&#xD;
to pay him such a sum, or let such a scoundrel bear away&#xD;
the important paper he boasts of possessing? Go your&#xD;
way, Master Girty, for this time. To secure the death of&#xD;
my enemy, I must let you live for the present, but be-&#xD;
ware oftour next meeting! We part now, but will&#xD;
meet again, and then,, if the devil does not play me false,&#xD;

CHAPTER XVIII.&#xD;
THE wicked designs of Montlack were now in a fair&#xD;
ray of being completely successful. The renegade, true&#xD;
to his base compact, had stolen the favorite steed of Major&#xD;
Maiden; and the latter, discovering his loss, had been fu-&#xD;
riou4in his rage, even beyondthe hopes or. desire of his&#xD;
plotting guest. The trail, for awhile cunningly con-&#xD;
cealed by-Girty, had at first balked the Major's eager&#xD;
hope ofdiscovering the thief, but found at last, accident-&#xD;
ally, asit then appeared, by Montlack ;-:but, indeed, just&#xD;
where the arch plotter-knew, his accomplice would leave&#xD;
the trace; with a ferocious shout, betokening his rage,&#xD;
and. desire for bloody vengeance, Maiden at once, and&#xD;

lowed the footprints, intentionally left by the renegade;&#xD;
nor did he halt, or linger for a .moment in his hot pur-&#xD;
suit, until the low. whining :of his horse, greeting his&#xD;
appearance, declared the, successful termination of'the&#xD;
hunt..&#xD;
The stolen horse, discovered in the immediate vicinity&#xD;
of the station, and secured by a  ride belonging to&#xD;
Bryan, whih was instantly recognizdby the quick eye&#xD;
of Malden heineeded no -farther proof as to who were the&#xD;

companion, ,4,ng'trail made by Girty, from the&#xD;
horse to the     )f     station, were entirely thrown&#xD;
away and unn     ay; for the situation of the stolen&#xD;
steed, the bridle, ,nd his own hatred'to Head, wer fully&#xD;
suffioient.for Maiden, and"proof enough to mak  him&#xD;
determine upon a a peg ryand' bloody reckoning.&#xD;
Jhis'fary,'the aheat.ded and unthinking borderer&#xD;
&#xD;
would have hastened at once without delay to the station&#xD;
to insure the punishment of those he believed guilty ; but&#xD;
so dangerous a move met with strenuous opposition from&#xD;
his more cautious comrade.&#xD;
Persuaded at last by Montlack, that to attempt present&#xD;
punishment would not only be dangerous, but might re-&#xD;
sult in defeat, and that it would be much better and much&#xD;
more certain of success to return home and summon to&#xD;
his aid all those who had taken the oath, with the excep-&#xD;
tion of Holding and Dobbins (for his wicked mentor&#xD;
took great pains to impress upon him the propriety of&#xD;
saying nothing of the theft, or as to who were suspected,&#xD;
to either of these, for fear of opposition), Malden at length&#xD;
yielded to persuasion, saying, with a fierce imprecation,&#xD;
as he shook his hand threateningly towards the distant&#xD;
station-&#xD;
" They shall not escape me; but, by the gods! Holding&#xD;
and Dobbins took the oath, and I would have them here&#xD;
to see the end of their horse-thieving friends !"&#xD;
"Nothing would please me better !" replied Montlack,&#xD;
with a devilish smile; " but as they would not believe&#xD;
this fellow guilty, even when he acknowledged himself a&#xD;
fugitive from prison, Lear they would still refuse to be-&#xD;
lieve, although here's evidence sufficient," pointing with&#xD;
his finger ,to the.horse and bridle, "to convince any one,"&#xD;
he added with a sneer, "unless determined to be blind !"&#xD;
"By the gods! you speak wisely, Captain," exclaimed&#xD;
Malden; "and though I'd like much to make Holding&#xD;
and Dobbins aid in the death of their roguish friends, I'll&#xD;
have to forego that pleasure, I suppose, for fear of their&#xD;
mealy-mouthed opposition. But what shall we do with&#xD;
the horse ?"&#xD;
"Leave him, of course !" replied Montlack; "for if we&#xD;
take him away, it might alarm ths rogues, and then, you&#xD;
know, it may be well enough t6bring our friends here&#xD;
to see for themselves, and be convinced, before we lead&#xD;
them on to punish the thieves"&#xD;
"Right again, Captain !" exclaimed Malden,. wondering&#xD;
at the quick shrewdness of 'his companion; I" 've a most&#xD;
excellent counsellor in you, for- twice you've saved me&#xD;

The slantingiis of the setting sun shot upwards from&#xD;
behindAhewep      agforest, gilding with its lingering&#xD;
light of gold t1 tops of the distant hills and woods,&#xD;
while Coma sat uponthe trunk of a fallen tree in the&#xD;
little yard of the station, waiting the coming of her hus-&#xD;
band. He had been gone since early dawn along with&#xD;
Daffe, on a hunting expedition, and it was now time for&#xD;
his 'return, and Coma noted with some uneasiness the&#xD;
declining luminary, as there was yet no sign of his ap.&#xD;
preach. Her eye was ever and anon thrown with&#xD;
less lane beyond the picket to the summit of a  i ant&#xD;
hillwhere she expected to catch the first si fhfis&#xD;
e1l-kl qn figure'; but, as time after time  loked&#xD;
thence, and saw nothing but the far-off ha r,.int with&#xD;
it;seatte   dwarf growth, now glow    it the last&#xD;
rays of the setting sun, then shroudea Whthe first shades&#xD;

her fair face, and something ver ear akin to fear settle&#xD;
down upon her heart.' But as  nas she withdrew her&#xD;
anxious gaze, the gambols   heboy, and the playful&#xD;
fawn upon the greenswar&amp;amp;    her side would attract&#xD;
her attention, and for the driveie away her uneasiness-;&#xD;
and then once more wryV e'smile, and encourage with&#xD;
laughing eye and  iA  ir sport, only to' return agai&#xD;
&#xD;
to her weary watching. It was by no nieans an, iinusual&#xD;
thing for the hunters to remain out as-late and even later&#xD;
than it then was; but somehow, Coma knew not why, she&#xD;
felt more uneasy and restless on, that particular evening&#xD;
than she had ever done before; and as the sun sank lower&#xD;
and lower, her' glances toward the forest became more&#xD;
frequent and searching, and the heaviness of her'heart&#xD;
could scarcely be removed by the glad laugh. of her&#xD;
romping child.&#xD;
But as she looked her eye brightened, the cloud upon&#xD;
her brow gave place to a gleam of yellow sunshine, and,&#xD;
springing to her feet with eager joy, she exclaimed-&#xD;
"Pa's coming, Bryan !"&#xD;
"Let me see!1" shouted the boy, running to herside.&#xD;
Taking him up' in her arms, Coma, with a glowing face,&#xD;
pointed out with her finger the now rapidly approaching&#xD;
person of his father.&#xD;
" Me see him " shouted the child, with a leap'of sudden&#xD;
joy, clapping his hands, "and uncle D'iffe, too; but where's&#xD;
'daddy Simon, mamma!1"&#xD;
"Daddy Simon has gone away, and won't be back for&#xD;
a long, long time," said the mother. " Don't you remem-&#xD;
ber, Bryan, how he told you he wouldn't ride you on his&#xD;
knee for so many days?"&#xD;
"But he has been gone a long time," insisted the child,&#xD;
in a discontented tone, "and I want to see daddy Simon,&#xD;
mama. When will he comeback to ride little Bryan?"&#xD;
"I don't know," replied the other, scarce noticing his&#xD;
eager inquiry, oi thinking of the answer she gave him,&#xD;

wife, "if, instead of the Sergeant or -myself, you had had&#xD;
the pleasure of packing, some five miles or more,, two of&#xD;
the finest bucks killed this season. Eh! what -do you&#xD;
think, Sergeant ?"&#xD;
"I think it by no means the niost pleasant part of a&#xD;
hunter's life-this packing of his game home, after he has&#xD;
slain it," replied the Sergeant, bluntly, busy the while&#xD;
wiping from his heated brow the gathering perspiration,&#xD;
but at the same 'time eyeing, with a sportsman's pride,&#xD;
the' size and fatness of the noble game lying at his feet.&#xD;
"'Tis a hunter's dot, and lie should never grumble,"&#xD;
laughed Goma; "but I suppose your toils have not de-&#xD;
stroyed your appetites, so I'll away and see to supper."&#xD;
"We'll answer that question, fair lady," replied Bryan,&#xD;
gayly, "when seated at your hospitable 'board; and have&#xD;
no fears of being chided for not paying our devours, like&#xD;
men of mould, to the good things of the table."&#xD;
.a         -       * .    *      *&#xD;
An hour later, and the two borderers, rested from the&#xD;
fatigue of their' day's hunt, with their sharpened appetites&#xD;
fully satisfied by a hearty meal, sat by the fireside of&#xD;
Head, enjoying that luxurious home feeling, so often ex-&#xD;
perienced by the traveller, after a weary day's journey,&#xD;
when safely ensconced by the warm hearthstone of some&#xD;
wayside inn ; but which is only enjoyed in all its dreamy&#xD;
beatitude by the hunter, after a toilsome tramp over bill,&#xD;
and' dale, and valley, in the eager pursuit of the wary&#xD;
deer.&#xD;
eThe Segeant, almost concealed in a cloud of tobacco-&#xD;
smoke, puffed with earnest good-will from a huge Indian&#xD;
pipe, was seemingly too happy and contented, or too&#xD;
much overcome by the mellowing infliences of rest, and&#xD;
warmth, and satisfied hunger, even for conversation;&#xD;
since, to several remarks made by Bryan, and to one or&#xD;
more inquiries from Coma, he merely nodded his head in&#xD;
acquiescence, as if careless orindifferent how his con-&#xD;
tinued nods were understood; or, as was the truth in his&#xD;
case, too much under the ',way'of his luxurious situation&#xD;
to make any exertion w  atver.&#xD;
Bryan, stretched leisueyout-in an easy, abandoned&#xD;
&#xD;
position, in a huge arm-chair, made soft and comfortable&#xD;
by repeated -folds of soft furs, seemed but little behind the&#xD;
honest Sergeant in listlessness, and by no means inclined&#xD;
to loquacity, though he did manage, now and then, with&#xD;
monosyllabic brevity, to answer the questions-of Coma,&#xD;
or reply to the unceasing prattle of his little son..&#xD;
It was a pleasant family scene-all love, warmth, and&#xD;
comfort-and .such a one as fully repays a man, for all&#xD;
the trouble, toil, and danger ever attending his path along&#xD;
the flowery or thorny journey of life. It was an hour of&#xD;
sunshine among the man# of clouds and darkness; and&#xD;
though that happy family were unconscious of danger,&#xD;
and dreamed not of the tempest then gathering, to burst&#xD;
with destructive fury over their devoted heads, yet it&#xD;
was even so;- and the storm was then swooping, to sweep&#xD;
away, and forever, all their household joys.&#xD;
And thus it ever is with man.&#xD;
In his happiest moments, when all seems bright, and&#xD;
gay, and joyous, and he is anticipating only a long con-&#xD;
tinuance of pleasure, sorrow comet, and soon his laugh&#xD;
is turned to mourning, his golden dreams to clouds of&#xD;
gloom, and he awakes, .with a shudder, to all the stern&#xD;
realities of life. Reveling in wealth, and enjoying all&#xD;
the luxuries of riches, our hearts are elate and proud;&#xD;
but the wind, or fire, or earthquake cometh; there is a&#xD;
roar, and it is all swept away; a crackle, and the fire,&#xD;
with greedy tongue, licks it all up ; or a sudden trem-&#xD;
bling of the earth, and ,it is gone forever. We strive&#xD;
after fame; our health, our youth, the best -days of. our&#xD;
manhood, and: may-be our very souls are given, and still&#xD;
it is forever eluding our grasp, until old age, with palsied&#xD;
hand and weakened faculty comethl, and death, crowding&#xD;
close after, sweeps us, along with all our hopes and cares,&#xD;
into the grave., At length we sleep in peace. We listen&#xD;
to the glad low tones of our children, and battle with the&#xD;
world (God only knows how fiercely) to clothe .them in&#xD;
purple and fine linen, andleave to them wealth. But&#xD;
one by one they fall around us, the diseases of infancy&#xD;
sweeping away some in the first bud; others, in the&#xD;
morning tide of life, go dwn t fthe grave; and even in&#xD;

strong manhood, those that are left may wither before&#xD;
our eyes; and after all, we ourselves sink down into the&#xD;
tomb with none to mourr our departure; and that wealth&#xD;
fQr which we risked all, and perhaps lost all, passes at&#xD;
length to strangers, or stillworse, to greedy and unthank-&#xD;
ful heirs.  Or may-be, in our glad young days, we&#xD;
dreamed of love, and worshipped the sweet smile and&#xD;
bright eye of some fair young creature, and when we had&#xD;
wooed. and won her, and transported her to our home,&#xD;
and called her our own, we thought ourselveshappy,. and&#xD;
beyond the reach of sorrow. But soon her eye grew&#xD;
dim, the roses on her cheek withered away, and the lute-&#xD;
like tones of her voice: sank into the low, inarticulate&#xD;
whisper of death, and we followed her, at last, to the&#xD;
grave. Such is life, and-such the fleeting joys and sor-&#xD;
rows of man!   'T is scarce worth the struggle we are&#xD;
every day making, and yet how loth are we all to take&#xD;
our long sleep! But Providence has ordained all things&#xD;
wisely.  We may be glad to-day and sad to-morrow.&#xD;
We know when the sunshine is around and about us, but&#xD;
We know not of the storm, until the winds and light-&#xD;
flings are playing about our heads. The little family-&#xD;
party gathered in the Winter Lodge of Coma were a&#xD;
pleasant group, reminding one of home comforts and&#xD;
home joys; and the two hunters, lolling listlessly before&#xD;
the fire after their long day's tramp, were fine pictures&#xD;
of abandoned enjoyment.&#xD;
Busied with some-of her household duties, Coma had&#xD;
not yet-although she had r eid*d nlo answer to more&#xD;
than one-of her inquiries-remarked the silence of her&#xD;
companions. But at length looking up, aftersa quiet&#xD;
gaze, first at her husband, and then at the cloud-covered -&#xD;
Sergeant, she,. with a merry laugh,:exclaimed-&#xD;
"A most amusing couple, indeed!1 and I owe you&#xD;
many thanks for the very. pleasant manner in which I&#xD;
have whiled away the last half hour, not forgetting the&#xD;
grave rods of. the one, or iteresting 'yes' or 'no' of the&#xD;
Qthod  I trust you won'tmake 'buck-carrying' the cause&#xD;
of' yoursilenge, as you4id for your late return."&#xD;
"Your yardon" V1replkd Bryan, smiling pleasantly at&#xD;
&#xD;
her badinage, "but you know, Coma, extreme happiness&#xD;
is as often the, cause of a silent tongue as extreme grief;&#xD;
and believe me now, when I say, it is not the fatigue of&#xD;
'buck-carrying,' as you insinuate,: or surliness, that has&#xD;
produced the taciturnity of which you complain; but 'in&#xD;
truth, nothing else than the indescribable pleasure of rest&#xD;
and fireside influences after a day of toil, is to be blamed&#xD;
for our present sinning.&#xD;
"Exactly!" muttered the Sergeant, managing to re-&#xD;
move his pipe, "it is just what I would have said myself,&#xD;
Bryan."&#xD;
"Could you have, spared the time from your pipe,"&#xD;
laughed Coma, interrupting him.&#xD;
"Exactly!" replied the.soldier, with a nod an4o:ko&#xD;
ing twinkle of the eye, covering his defeat with a',cloud&#xD;
of smoke.&#xD;
"But, after all," said Coma, "I'm at a loss whether to&#xD;
take your excuse as a compliment, or not ; for it is one&#xD;
or the other, just as we ascribe it to the toils of the day,&#xD;
or the soothing influences of home."&#xD;
"To the latter, of course !" laughed her husband, "for&#xD;
when saw you a hunter complain of fatigue,- after an&#xD;
hour's rest and a hearty meal?"&#xD;
"Always the same, and there's no getting the truth&#xD;
.from any of you !" replied Conia, with a merry toss of&#xD;
the head, once. more resuming her employment; "for you&#xD;
are all flatterers alike-whether in palace or hovel-&#xD;
whether savage or civilized. But to make us poor wo-&#xD;
men the source of your stupidity, and call- it a compli-&#xD;
ment is too bad, and I'll have nothing more to say to&#xD;
you." 0&#xD;
Ten minutes may have followed this laughing raillery&#xD;
of Coma, when the Sergeant, suddenly withdrawing from&#xD;
his mouth his pipe, started to his feet, with an eager ex-&#xD;
pression-of countenantcs -as if listening intently for some&#xD;
distant sound.&#xD;
"What is it ?" said Braanquickly.&#xD;
"I thought I heard the trym: of horsemen," muttered&#xD;
Duffe, again sinking back in bi iseat.&#xD;

"I hear nothing but the sighing of the winds; but&#xD;
there it is again !" he exclaimed; "I distinctly hear the&#xD;
tramp of horses 1"&#xD;
"I hear nothing !" said Bryan, listening attentively."&#xD;
"Nor do 1, now; but I could not have been mistaken."&#xD;
"You must have been dreaming, Sergeant,": said Head,&#xD;
with a snmi at the doubting' expression of his compa--&#xD;
nion's face. "Who could be riding through the forest at&#xD;
this time of night ? If you heard anything more than&#xD;
the windit must have been the tramp of a passing herd&#xD;
of buffalo."&#xD;
"I may have been mistaken," replied the Sergeant,&#xD;
thoughtfully; "but my ear played me a strange trick if I&#xD;
heard not. the regular gallop of. horses."&#xD;
Startled by the abrupt exclamation of Duffe, Coma had&#xD;
stood trembling, during the conversation between him&#xD;
and her husband---her face fully expressing the terror of&#xD;
her beating heart. She wasj fearful of another attack of&#xD;
the savages upon the station; and since her captivity, her&#xD;
countengnce grew pale at the sound of every strange or&#xD;
undtathoise, .With her earnow painfully acute from&#xD;
fearfulanxiety, she was the first to catch the low tread&#xD;
of cautious footsteps in the yard without the cabin, and,&#xD;
with' a dreadful effort to appear calm, whispered with ter-&#xD;
rified distinctness-&#xD;
"Hear you not that?"&#xD;

moment.&#xD;
"Better be certainI" said Bryan in a ,low voice, as&#xD;
Duffe moved towards the door, "it may be a strolling&#xD;
band of savages, hailing in this manner, to throw us off&#xD;
our guard."&#xD;
"No fear of that !" said Duffe, confidently, "for no In-&#xD;
dian ever gave that hail; and besides," he added, unhesi-&#xD;
tatingly drawing back the door, "I know the.voice."&#xD;
He did know the voice; but it was the voice of a friend&#xD;
betraying him to destruction.&#xD;
The sharp volley of rifles, greeted the appearance of&#xD;
the unsuspecting soldier; and poor Duffe, a victim of&#xD;
treachery, decoyed to death by the voice of an old com-&#xD;
panion in arms, fell backwards across the threshold he&#xD;
had just passed in the full vigor of health and life, a&#xD;
corpse. He had fought through the battles of the Revo-&#xD;
lution; the bloody Camden; the daring struggle of Greene&#xD;
at Guilford Court-hou'e; and had joined in many'a wild&#xD;
fray upon the border, and escaped from all without a&#xD;
wound, only to die at last by the hand of assassins, and&#xD;
without a blow for life or vengeance. The, cradle, the&#xD;
world, and the grave, the three great scenes in life, to him&#xD;
had passed away, and he slept now the quiet sleep of&#xD;
death.&#xD;
Springing to his rifle, Bryant prepared to -sell his life&#xD;
dearly, and avenge, if with*dhis power, the cowardly&#xD;
murder of his foster-father. Nor  was he a moment too&#xD;
soon ; for a rush of feet followed the fall of Duffeand&#xD;

4ae his appearance.&#xD;
For a moment, the heartless hypocrite stood eyeing the&#xD;

"My cousin gives me but a cold welcome!" snee&#xD;
Montlack.&#xD;
At the sound of his icy and measured voice, Coma&#xD;
started, and a shudder passel over her frame; but she&#xD;
made no reply, only motioning with her hand, as if she&#xD;
would drive some loathsome monster fromn her sight,&#xD;
 "Ha! ha !" laughed'the cold-blooded villain; "my dear&#xD;
cousin plays the tragic queen to admiration! 'Tis a pity&#xD;

"You have slain the beautiful and brave," m  mured&#xD;

" The forger and thief !" sneered Montlack.&#xD;

faith, has not forgotten how to use it !"&#xD;
"Begonel! and free me from your presence!" exclaimed&#xD;
Coma, with a threatening gesture, her eye flashing with&#xD;
wild fury. -"Your fiendish malice, has pursued him to&#xD;
death; but beware, Jean, their of vengeance will yet&#xD;
come P'&#xD;
"'Tis already hereI" muttered Montlack.&#xD;

OR, VOW FULFILLED.&#xD;
&#xD;
r threats generally end in harmless noise 1" sneered&#xD;
Montlack.&#xD;
Him you dared not meet as man to man, has fallen&#xD;
at last beneath the blows of hired assassins !" murmured&#xD;
Coma, her fury once more giving place to a gush of tears.&#xD;
Begone,.now, and leave me to my grief; for you have&#xD;
done your worst !"&#xD;
"Re met7 the fate of all those that would balk my&#xD;
plans  muttered Montlack, "but I have not done yet."&#xD;
What other .victim would you, have to gloat your&#xD;
malice ?" said Coma, looking fearfully around in search&#xD;
of her child. "If you seek my blood, take it; I offer it&#xD;
freely, for I would not live, now that he is dead; but in&#xD;
metcy's name, spare my orphan boy 1"&#xD;
"I seek neither the blood of mother nor child," said&#xD;
Montlack, coldly; "but there was a time Coma, when I&#xD;
was dren-ay, Jean Montlack was driven like a dog!"&#xD;
he shouted, his face becoming livid with rage at the very&#xD;
memory of his ignominious situation, "and with his. hands&#xD;
tied behind him as a thief, to witness the defeat of all his&#xD;
hopes, and the triumph of his hated. rival I-Do you re-&#xD;
mmber that scene, 'Com a ?"&#xD;
Shuddering at his fearful vehemence, and wondering to&#xD;
what this bitter allusion to the past would lead, Coma&#xD;
stared wildly in his face, but made no reply.&#xD;
"Ay, if you don't remember it, I do !" he continued, in&#xD;
the same bitter and mocking tone; "I can. never forget&#xD;
how that cursed low-born friend of your husband forced&#xD;
be present-an unwillng witness of yougnarriage,&#xD;
he then exulteder o my defeat-taunting me&#xD;
h his vugare :ttims       Do you n   recollect," he&#xD;
dled, with hissing emphasis, "his'gatuiig jest when the-&#xD;

Coma shook her heady&#xD;

this littlpiece ofplea try has escaped the memory of&#xD;
my cousin, she-has at sme recollection of my reply ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"No, noI I remember nothing 1' murmured Cons&#xD;
covering her eyes to shut the malignant expression ofciai&#xD;
cuntenance, as, with a cold, derisive smile, he awaited&#xD;
her answer.&#xD;
"I swore then that the time would come when he that&#xD;
was Head should be made Headless, and the hour to fulfil&#xD;
my vow is now at hand !"&#xD;
What more would you do 2" exclaimed Coma, shud-&#xD;
dering with horror at the dreadful import of his words.&#xD;
"This 1" hissed Montlack, severing the head of his&#xD;
victim from the body, and holding it up before the horri-&#xD;
fied gaze of the ife&#xD;
With devilish glee the brutal villain stood a moment&#xD;
enjoying the agony of the gasping and speechless widow;&#xD;
then tossing the gory head of the husband into the lap of&#xD;
the wife,* he exclaimed, tauntingly-&#xD;
" If I remember rightly, there was .a time when Jean&#xD;
Montlack offered his hand and heart to Coma De Lacy,&#xD;
but she preferred a low-born knave, and scorned his&#xD;
offered gift ! I trust," he. added, with a mocking laugh,&#xD;
"she'll receive, with better grace, his last present ! Ha!&#xD;
ha! he was Head once, but is Headless now, and my vow&#xD;
"      eBut not childless !" murmured Coma, mournfully, as&#xD;
she threw her arm around the shrinking form of her little,&#xD;
boy, who at this awful moment crept with tearful eyes- to&#xD;
her side, and, as he saw his mother kiss the bloody brow&#xD;
of his father, faintly lisped the endearing title-'Papa"&#xD;
"De dam bloody villain 1" howled old Titus, Jiir&#xD;
streaming down his sable countenance. "Gora'jh&#xD;
Miss Sally, can you cut dese dam ropes, and letne t&#xD;

The blackat  the  st note of alarm, had rushed to the&#xD;

powered by the regulate s, he had been securely bound,&#xD;

THE WINTER LODGE;&#xD;
&#xD;
d had been a silent witness of the meeting between her&#xD;
aid Montlack upto this-moment, when, no longer able to&#xD;
restrain his fury, whilst struggling to break his bonds,&#xD;
hadthus shoutedforth his malediction. ugn the head of&#xD;
thigassassin, and his cry for assistance to the widow of&#xD;
Difre.&#xD;
Turning.quickly, at the deep, fierce cry of the negro,&#xD;
Montlack, inalarm, drew up his rifle, exclaiming, with&#xD;
an oath, as he pointed it, in a threatening manner, at the&#xD;
weeping widow of the Sergeant-&#xD;
"Move but one step, and I'll fire."&#xD;
His cowardly threat was needless; for the poor woman,&#xD;
kneeling by the body of her husband, heard neither the&#xD;
cry of the one, nor the menace of the other, and, indifferent&#xD;
le to both continued, with low sobs, to pour forth her&#xD;
heavy grief. Seeing that such was the case, and that he&#xD;
had nothing to fear from her interference, Montlack shook&#xD;
his hand menacingly at the slave, muttering-&#xD;
"Another word, you blackrascal, and I'll soon put an&#xD;
end to your bellowing."&#xD;
"If I be black," growled Titus, sirlily "I'se got a&#xD;
white heart; and dat's more dan a dam cowardly mur.-&#xD;
derin' villian like Captin' Montlack can say."&#xD;
Seeing that the black's continued and fierce struggles&#xD;
to"free himself were hopeless, and not caring to longer&#xD;
bandy epithets -ith him, Montlack turned away-to con-&#xD;
inue his cruel triumph over Coma.&#xD;
But=the sight that greeted his wondering gaze, when&#xD;
he ber ned' from Titus, filledeven the breast ofthe devil-&#xD;

even to her malignant enemy, those heavy folds, but&#xD;
moment since as black as the raven's wing, were now as ;&#xD;
white as the driven snow.&#xD;
Horror, tetpr, and griet had produced this fearful&#xD;
change, and in one moment of dread supremacy had done&#xD;
the work of years.&#xD;
Filled with awe, Montlack gazed a minute with shud-&#xD;
dering curiosity at the wonderful change wrought by a&#xD;
few moments of intense despair; then turning away-for&#xD;
he no longer had any desire to exult over his victim-&#xD;
with a silent gesture of horror and fear, he stole cau-&#xD;
tiously, as if fearful of arousing her attention, from the&#xD;
room; and with a wild cry of anguish, fled the dreadful&#xD;
sight.&#xD;
In vain did hefly; for Remorse had&#xD;
"flapped&#xD;
Her fiery wings, and breathed upon his lips."&#xD;
The vulture's bloody beak was now fastened in his&#xD;
heart; and, awake or sleeping, the gory head of his vic-&#xD;
tim, the blanched locks of his mourning cousin, and sad&#xD;
face of her orphan child, will ever press, like a horrid&#xD;
nightmare, upon his soul, and drive away all peace.&#xD;

"We advise our readers to obtain the book, and enjoy it to the full themselves. They will unite&#xD;
with us in saying that the self-drawn character portrayed in the letters of Lord Jeffrey,is one of the&#xD;
most delightful pictures that has ever been presented to them."-Evening Bulletin.&#xD;
"Jeffrey was for a long period editor of the Review, and was admitted by all the other contribu-&#xD;
tors to be the leading spirit in it. In addition to his political articles, he soon showed his wonderful&#xD;
powers of criticism in literature. He was equally at home whether censuring or applauding; i&#xD;

on Shakspeare, or Scott, or Burns."--New York Express.&#xD;

CONSISTING OF A SERIES OF&#xD;
Cabinet     Histones        of   all   the    States     of   the    Union&#xD;
TO EMBRACE A VOLUME FOR EACH STATE.&#xD;
We have so far completed all our arrangements, as to be able to issue the whole series in the&#xD;
shortest possible time consistent with its careful literary production. SEVERAL VOLUMES ARE&#xD;
NOW READY FOR SALE. The talented authors who have engaged to write these Histories, are&#xD;
n., strangers in the literary world.&#xD;
NOTICES OF THE PRESS.&#xD;
"These most tastefully printed and bound volumes form the first instalment of a series of State&#xD;
Histories, which, without superseding the bulkier and more expensive works of the same charac-&#xD;
ter, may enter household channels from which the others would be excluded by their cost and&#xD;
magnitude."&#xD;
"In conciseness, clearness, skill of arrangement, and graphic interest, they are a most excellent&#xD;
earnest of those to come. They are eminently adapted both to interest and instruct, and should&#xD;
nave a place in the family library of every Americn."-N. Y. Courier and Enquirer.&#xD;
"The importance of a series of State, History like those now in preparation, can scarcely be esti-&#xD;
mated. Being condensed as carefully as accuracy and interest of narrative will permit, the size&#xD;
and price of the volumes will bring them within the reach of every family in the country, thus&#xD;
making them home-reading books for old and young. Each individual will, in consequence, become&#xD;
familiar, not only with the history of his own State, but with that of the-other States; thus mutual&#xD;
interests will be re-awakened, and old bonds cemented in a firmer re-union."-Home Gazette.&#xD;
NEW THEMES FOR THE PROTESTANT CLERGY;&#xD;
CREEDS WITHOUT CHARITY, THEOLOGY WITHOUT HUMANITY, AND PROTESTANT-&#xD;
ISM WITHOUT CHRISTIANITY:&#xD;
With Notes by the Editor on the Literature of Charity, Population, Pauperism, Political&#xD;
Economy, and Protestantism.&#xD;
'The great question which the book discusses is, whether the Church of this age is what the&#xD;
primitive Church was, and whether Christians-both pastors and people-are doing their duty. Our&#xD;
author believes not, and, to our mind, he has made out a.strong case, He thinks there is abundant&#xD;
room for reform at the present time, and that it is needed almost as much as in the days of Luther.&#xD;
And whyI Because, in his own words, 'While one portion of nominal Christians have busied&#xD;
themselves with forms and ceremonies and observances; with pictures, images, and processions;&#xD;
others have given to doctrines the supremacy, and have busied themselves in laying down the&#xD;
lines by which to enforce human belief-lines of interpretation by which to control human opinion&#xD;
-lines of discipline and restraint, by which to bring human minds to uniformity of faith and action.&#xD;
They have formed creeds and catechisms; they have spread themselves over the whole field of the&#xD;
sacred writings, and scratched up all the surface ; they have gathered all the -straws, and turned&#xD;
over all the pebbles, and detected the colour and determined the outline of every stone and tree&#xD;
and shrub; they have dwelt with rapture upon all that was beautiful and sublime; but they have&#xD;
trampled over mines of golden wisdom, of surpassingrichness and depth, almost without a thought,&#xD;
and almost without an effort to fathom these priceless treasures, much less to takepossession&#xD;
of them'&#xD;
