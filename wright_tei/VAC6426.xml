            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHAT Life has taught me, I have written. "What is writ, is writ, would it were
               worthier." This book is a romance, but it contains more of fact than fiction; the
               incidents of the child life of the characters are mostly memories; the memories of
               our childhood are sacred in our riper years.</p>
            <p>The memories of youth, too, are holy; the college-boy and school-girl opinions of
               this world, and the inhabitants thereof, I have represented as I have known them, in
               my acquaintance with developing humanity. The <emph>sentimental season</emph> of
               human progress is pictured here somewhat in the ideal. There are many natures only
               partially developed who will not sympathize in the wild, pure dreams of the
                  <emph>perfect</emph> humanity. They come to all, however, in a life-time.
                  "<emph>How we have loved, and hoped and aspired!</emph>" Most of us find our
               "idols made of clay," and men learn to mock at the wrecks of the beautiful which they
               once worshipped, and the wild dreams that once gave life its glory. In this men do
               wrong; the glory of those perished hopes was caught from better regions, and will
               come back to us, when the discipline of earthly education has taken away the dross of
               earthly being.</p>
            <p>There is very little of fiction in the Southern Life represented in this book; the
               conversations and incidents are such as occurred with southern people; the negro
               characters are all from<pb n="iv-v (Table of Contents) " xml:id="VAC6426-00000003"/>
               life, without the veil of false names. If, at times, the name of the Supreme Being is
               mentioned with seeming irreverence, in these pages, I have only to say that I have
               used it as those around me were accustomed to use it when speaking earnestly on
               subjects that stirred the vital depths of humanity. May the "Our Father" forgive me,
               if I have taken His name too lightly upon my pen, even in portraying the words of His
               imperfect children of earth. The heroine and hero of this book are ideal characters;
               the others are mostly portraits drawn from life. If there is any one character
               especially unnatural in this book, that character is a portrait from life; if there
               is any one incident of this book that is especially improbable, that incident is
               fact.</p>
            <p>This book is written to show how we are the framers of our own destinies, the
               materials for the work being given by the All-Father. Some tell us that great souls
               control circumstances; but circumstances <emph>must</emph> influence and educate even
               the strongest souls. "We must <emph>work</emph> out our salvation (even on earth)
               with fear and trembling."</p>
            <p>"Faith without works is dead."</p>
            <p>This book is written for all who have doubted God when the Tempter has met them
                  <emph>alone</emph> in the deserts of life.</p>
            <p>This book is written for all who have doubted God under temptations that wrung the
               last fibre of the <emph>perfect</emph> triune nature—the passionate, intellectual and
               spiritual being.</p>
            <p>"There hath no temptation taken you, but such as is <emph>common</emph> to man; but
                  <emph>God is faithful,</emph> and will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye
               are able, but will, with the temptation, also make a way of escape, that ye may be
               able to bear it."</p>

               <p>"WHAT a grand time we'll have this afternoon! School is out in time for lots of
                  fun."</p>
               <p>Mag stood on the school-house steps, and as she spoke her eye took a sweeping
                  glance upward, as if she knew the universe was hers, and had only to choose from
                  its infinite resources the joys most delicious to her present mood. She quickly
                  drank the inspiration, then skipped from the door, hopping across the green with a
                  motion like a young robin.</p>
               <p>She paused a moment by a little specimen of mortality, laden with a bag of
                  marbles, and commenced an original "pas seul" around him, half dancing, half
                  hovering—then, struck by a sudden thought, darted off toward the brook, her hair
                  flying over her eyes.</p>
               <p>"Come, Josie, let's swing!" she called to a small, blue-eyed beauty, who stood
                  near, and springing to catch the lowest branches of a sycamore shading the stream,
                  she swung herself over the waters on a flying leap.</p>
               <p>"Ain't it fun, Josie?"</p>
               <p>Josie thought it was—and as she came up, caught hold of the same branch, and the
                  two, clinging together, made<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6426-00000005"/> a safe air
                  journey above the waters that fretted over the rocks. As they landed, Mag, the
                  madcap, with a bound clasped the limb above Josie's fingers and swung off
                  again.</p>
               <p>"You, Mag, you'll push me in!" Josie called in alarm. "My fingers are slipping!"
                  And sure enough, off slipped Josie's fingers, and off went Josie among the rocks
                  into the water, dragging Mag down upon her as she went.</p>
               <p>"Hillo, Mag, that was splendidly done! Precisely like yourself!" called a little
                  rascal from the bank. "That is what is termed landing into the water."</p>
               <p>He was a short, broad-shouldered little fellow of fifteen, whose black eyes were
                  perpetually boiling with mischief.</p>
               <p>"I always knew you were amphibious. Thought you'd visit your cousins the frogs?
                  How that splash must have astonished the innocents! Can't see why you always do
                  consider it your duty to <emph>pitch in!</emph> You scare their very wits out of
                  'em!"</p>
               <p>Mag helped herself demurely out of the water.</p>
               <p>"It is decidedly a funny exploit, Mag!" Frank concluded, as he turned toward a
                  group of boys. Mag gave her hand to Josie—poor child—who stood dripping like a
                  mermaid—her garments dripping water and her eyes dripping tears. Josie was
                  completely drenched; Mag, by falling upon her, had wet only her feet.</p>
               <p>"I'll never play with you again, Mag Barclay!" said Josie angrily, as she
                  emerged.</p>
               <p>Mag put her finger in her mouth to prevent a laugh at the ludicrous appearance of
                  Josie's clinging dress.</p>
               <p>"I'm sorry about it lots, Josie; I didn't mean to do it," said Mag, as she
                  attempted to wring the water from the dress.</p>
               <p>"I'm sorry lots, too, but what good does that do? It won't dry my dress," said
                  Josie, pouting. "Just let me alone now, will you? I think you have done enough for
                  once."</p>
               <p>Mag lifted her eyebrows, shrugged her shoulders, and walked off toward Frank and
                  Alec Ross, her cousins, who were discussing the chances for sport.</p>
               <p>"It will be a capital time for ball," Frank was saying, in most energetic tones;
                  "and I've a bran-span new one, that will just do the business
                  <emph>prime.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"No, no, Frank, its too warm to play ball," was the response. "Let's go fishing! I
                  know a grand place over the hills yonder, and the <emph>way</emph> sucker and
                  trout will bite such a day as this."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes! oh, yes! let's go fishing!" eagerly chimed in Mag. "I know where the
                  place is! down by the deep hole where the big rocks shade the water, and the big
                  trees shade the rocks. It's splendid! I'll climb the rocks while you are fishing,
                  if you can't lend me a hook. I reckon I shall find a bird's nest; maybe I'll see a
                  flying squirrel. Won't it be fun!"</p>
               <p>"I should just think you'd be ashamed, Mag, to be always tagging us boys around!"
                  Frank bolted out for reply. "We never go anywhere, but you think you must go too.
                  You plague us more'n a little. Last time I went hunting you wasted all my powder
                  shooting fish, 'cause you didn't dare shoot up a tree—spoilt my pistol, too,
                  trying to hit flowers—you peppered 'em amazingly; but we don't want you with us
                  always. The first we should know of you, you'd be perched, like a monkey, in the
                  top of a tree, or splashing into the water—it's a way you have of doing—and
                  scaring all the fish. We never could get a single bite with you around. What a
                     <emph>tom-boy</emph> you are, anyhow, Mag Barclay!"</p>
               <p>Poor Mag! Poor little Mag! She stopped short in bewildered
                  amazement—stunned—thunderstruck. Frank's harangue astounded her—made her brain
                  reel. It had never occurred to her as among the list of possibilities, that her
                  sports and employments might be separate from her cousin Frank's, and his speech
                  was a perfect apocalypse to her. Her mental eye took its first divining glance
                  into the depths of her own being. Socrates taught that the foundation and essence
                  of all knowledge was <emph>self</emph> knowledge.<pb n="10-11"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000006"/> The first thorough, true lessons in self-wisdom are
                  frequently stern and painful ones. This was Mag's first lesson, flung at her in
                  rude fashion, by a rough boy-Socrates. "Know thyself, Magdalene Barclay!" was the
                  substance of the lesson, and she was an apt disciple, nor slighted it because it
                  was a distressing one to learn. She lived an age of thought as she stood pondering
                  it, her forefinger again in her mouth and her eye fixed on the toe of her shoe,
                  which was working industriously, but unconsciously, in the sand—the image of
                  abstraction—of woefully puzzled bewilderment. The blood had rushed in a tempest
                  over her neck and face as Frank went on; it quietly subsided, flowing back from
                  her very finger-tips, and a long sigh relieved her heart, as a medley of thought
                  poured through her busy, curious brain.</p>
               <p>"Now that she thought of it, what a queer little, forlorn human she must be, sure
                  enough. She guessed the rest of the girls didn't play with the boys as she did,"
                  and she added, half in spite, "It wasn't because they didn't want to, but they
                  didn't know enough to learn how! And she was a <emph>tom-boy?</emph> Oh, dear! she
                  was afraid she was, and she couldn't help it. She guessed she looked like a
                  tom-boy." And her eye roved from her stringless shoe to the pantalette that hung
                  in a tattered fringe over it. Her apron was shockingly stained with berries, that
                  she had gathered in it on her way to school. She swept back the tangled masses of
                  hair from her eyes, and took another view. Both shoes were covered with sand and
                  mud, which were forming into plaster on her ankles. "Oh, dear! she reckoned she
                  did look like a <emph>tom-boy,</emph> there was no denying it; it was a miserable
                     <emph>fact</emph> she wondered she had never thought of it before. But what
                  could she do about it? How could she help liking to play ball? Couldn't she catch
                  it as well as the best of 'em? and sweep it as far as Frank, himself? Then, too,
                  couldn't she climb trees? and didn't she love to look for squirrels and bird's
                  nests? and how could she help loving to do it? and why not she as well as Frank
                  and Alec? They didn't know half as many bird's nests as she. And why mightn't she
                  climb into the tops of the cherry-trees, and apple-trees, and pear-trees? She knew
                  the way the chip-mucks had found into the tops of the chestnut-trees."</p>
               <p>And while she was cogitating these mighty questions, she stood pondering the toe
                  of her shoe, which was making wonderful geometrical diagrams in the sand—and she
                  puzzled her queer little brain over many of her life-problems that were terribly
                  hard to solve; and as she puzzled over them, she grew grieved, and choked down a
                  throatful of sobs, and half-strangled herself swallowing tears, while Frank, Alec,
                  and their companions, left her, deep in her mathematical and metaphysical
                  abstraction. Poor Mag! It was the saddest lesson she had ever studied. At last,
                  heaving a long, deep sigh, of unavailing regret, she started for home, with her
                  meditations.</p>
               <p>"If she mustn't, or couldn't, or shouldn't play with the boys, what on earth could
                  she do with herself? She didn't want to play with the girls all the time, in doll
                  houses, with rag-babies—and the rest of the girls did nothing else; she didn't
                  love to sit and make dolls' frocks and petticoats. Live babies were pretty enough
                  (all except her baby cousin, Harry Fenn—what a little cub he was, to be sure);
                  when she played with babies, she'd have a real live baby of her own; but
                  rag-babies! she didn't like them, and she couldn't like them, and moreover, she
                  wouldn't like them—and oh dear! what was there for her to like? She wished she was
                  a boy, as well as Frank—boys could have just the nicest sort of fun, and go where
                  they pleased. Dear, dear, she wondered why she couldn't have been a boy."</p>
               <p>In the midst of her reverie, she found herself at home. Pussy met her in the yard,
                  and rubbed her fur against Mag's dress, and looked up wistfully into her dolefully
                  wise face. Mag took her up in her arms, and commenced any quantity of pussy-talk,
                  in cooing, pet-tones, and vented her self-pity on the cat. "Poor pussy! Poor,
                  little, forlorn, friendless pussy-<emph>cat!</emph> We are <emph>so sorry,</emph>
                  ain't we, pussy? You and I,<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6426-00000007"/> and all
                  kittens in trouble, are sorry about it, and the more we are sorry the more it
                  don't do a bit of good!" And so she somewhat relieved herself.</p>
               <p>Then she threw her bonnet on the grass, seated herself on the cottage door-step,
                  and gazed upon the broad hill beyond the brook, and into the sky beyond the
                  hill.</p>
               <p>The sweep of green pasture and forest, and the massive ledge of rock, darkling
                  among the green, caught her attention; then a gush of sunshine flooded it with
                  glory, and the beauty entered her soul, and she saw mysteries in the blue,
                  unfathomable sky, and strange forms were flitting among the snowy cloud-piles; and
                  as she looked, the restless bitterness softened into sadness, that crept down into
                  her heart.</p>
               <p>At last she became weary of it all, and there came a spirit of rebellion against
                  fate, against sorrow and sadness. "She wouldn't fret about it, nor break her
                  heart, either. Who would care if she did, or didn't; and there was no use in it.
                  If her heart ached, nobody but herself was hurt. It didn't hurt Frank when her
                  heart ached, any more than when her finger ached, and it did no one any good, and
                  she wouldn't be such a little goose as to ache all for nothing, and all alone,
                  too." So she roused herself.</p>
               <p>Two or three cages of canaries hung under the locust-trees in the yard, and there
                  came a gush of bird-music to charm away the overplus of wisdom with which she was
                  almost submerged. The expression of abstraction on her features was not becoming;
                  the light faded out of the merry brown eyes; the dimples were all hidden, that
                  played hide-and-seek around her mouth; and the red lips covered the white teeth
                  with a premature, gloomy pout, that was anything but lovely. Perhaps the birds
                  noticed it, and trilled out their melody to hint that there was a better sort of
                  wisdom for her to learn.</p>
               <p>Then Mag helped puss to some supper. She had found in a corner of her head, an
                  original invention for feeding cats. She filled a bottle with milk, and, holding
                  it over pussy's head, taught her to catch the stream upon her tongue as it fell.
                  Puss felt interested—was an apt scholar, and soon lapped the showers of drops with
                  marvellous skill. "You are not <emph>prejudiced</emph> against milk, are you,
                  kitty?" said she, going on with her kitty-talk, and laughing at the grotesque
                  expressions of kitty's countenance in the performance. Part of the stream spilled
                  upon the grass. "You and I are philosophers, ain't we, pussy-cat? We don't
                     <emph>cry over spilt milk,</emph> that we don't; 'cause why? it don't do a bit
                  of good, and it makes us ache, which is bad, and not comfortable!"</p>
               <p>Mag had a passion for pets, if not for babies. She petted Uncle Alph's pony; it
                  came up to the fence, and watched puss at her supper; so Mag got some bread and
                  salt and let him eat out of her hand, for which he thanked her with a low
                  whinny.</p>
               <p>Then a tame crow came hopping up, and looked at puss and the milk-bottle with
                  longing eyes. Mag did not offer him the bottle.</p>
               <p>"No, no, Tommy; milk isn't good for crows, and you couldn't eat out of this
                  bottle, and you'd know it if you had ever read Mr. Æsop's fable of the Fox and the
                  Stork; but what a dunce you are, Tommy! you never read that much in all your
                  life!"</p>
               <p>Tom was a wretched phenomenon; Alec Ross had caught him in the fields, and given
                  him to Mag. Nearly every feather had been torn from him by fate or cruel
                  misfortune, and he was a striking representation of that definition: "Man—an
                  unfeathered biped." Mag bestowed any amount of pity on his forlorn condition.</p>
               <p>"Don't I pity you, Tom? Don't I sympathize with you? Ain't you a poor Tom in
                  trouble, and ain't I a tom-boy in trouble? Haven't I a fellow-feeling for you,
                  Tom? that I have." And then she flitted off to feed the squirrels, Bunny and Susy,
                  and the rabbits, Billy and Nelly, and at last she was quite herself again. Aunt
                  Lina then called her to set the table for supper, and she ran in.</p>
               <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6426-00000008"/>
               <p>"Mag Barclay, what a looking sight you are!" exclaimed Aunt Lina, as she made her
                  appearance; "I should think you were brought up among the heathen. What on earth
                  am I ever to do with such a young one? I declare I'm at my <emph>wit's
                  end!</emph>"</p>
               <p>And so was Mag, which was nothing uncommon, either in Mag or her aunt; both
                  survived the catastrophe, as usual.</p>
               <p>But that day Mag was destined to prove the truth of the old adage, "Sorrows never
                  come singly." As she was taking down the canaries, one little, restless bird
                  contrived to slip a wire of his cage, and pushed himself into freedom. Straightway
                  he fluttered into the locust branches, overhead. It was a daring experiment for
                  his untried wings. How he felt about his bravery, he did not make known, though he
                  semed quite in a flutter, and Mag under the tree was in what might be termed a
                  flutteration. In her excessive sympathy she would have flown immediately after
                  Willy, up among the green leaves, but unfortunately she was not yet endowed with
                  wings. She followed him by means of her hands and feet as soon as possible, but he
                  was too wary for her; she could not find him. Mag commenced shaking the branches,
                  hoping he would be silly enough to fall off into her apron, instead of which he
                  flew off over the house-top, and she was left in a quandary. Not being able to
                  follow him in his flight, she did the next best thing, climbed a ladder and
                  mounted guard upon the cottage roof, and commenced observations, some with her
                  brown eyes, <emph>for</emph> Willy, some with her red lips <emph>concerning</emph>
                  him.</p>
               <p>"Oh! oh! oh! I want a dozen new cages, and I will have them," was her first cry:
                  her next was a gush of tears. She was getting over-excited, and losing her
                  equanimity.</p>
               <p>"What you want of a dozen new cages beats me," said Aunt Lina, who came out in the
                  midst of the tribulation; "you have only six birds, and one bird can't be in two
                  cages at the same time," which remark contained a profound truth.</p>
               <p>Mag found out soon that her tears were a worse than useless outlay of capital;
                  they dimmed her eyes so that she could not look for Willy, so she concluded to get
                  cool; she wiped away the mist, and continued her watch upon the house-top till
                  nightfall.</p>
               <p>Frank and Alec passed her on their way home from fishing.</p>
               <p>"You are getting mighty <emph>high</emph>-notions, Mag," called Frank; "you are
                  looking <emph>up</emph> in the world, I see."</p>
               <p>Mag did not condescend to reply.</p>
               <p>"Well, I always knew you were a <emph>rising</emph> genius," he continued, and Mag
                  very expressively turned her back upon him.</p>
               <p>"Amazing <emph>up</emph>ish, ain't you? 'Hem—guess you'll come <emph>down</emph>
                  some, by and by," he added, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">sotto voce,</foreign> as he
                  opened the garden gate, and went home.</p>
               <p>Sport, her dog, came barking and frisking around—in vain—Willy would not come
                  back. Grandma Walton came out and sympathized with her, and the sympathy conquered
                  her; her philosophy broke down under it, entirely, and at last, giving up to grief
                  and disappointment, she went sobbing to bed.</p>
               <p>Before going to sleep she bethought herself of the great "Our Father," who could
                  help her in <emph>all</emph> her troubles. Utterly subdued and broken-hearted, she
                  prayed to Him to take care of Willy through the long night, and to help her be
                  good, so that Frank would never call her a tom-boy again. Then she quietly sobbed
                  herself to sleep.</p>
               <p>Mag was an orphan—an embryo specimen of immortality, sent by a wise and mysterious
                  Providence to develop amid the sunshine and storms of earth. A peculiar soul—as
                  many souls are—destined to search for and find sympathies among the accordant and
                  discordant elements of this sphere of existence; destined to marvel, as all souls
                  do marvel, through childhood, youth and age, concerning the mysteries by<pb

                  develop, according to the use made of the talents of mind and body, and the
                  circumstances in which they were to act, either into a noble being—an honor to its
                  Maker, or destined to work out its own destruction, and add another to the list of
                  weak and unfaithful ones, who have permitted themselves to be tempted beyond
                  refuge.</p>
               <p>A somewhat peculiar soul. There were mingled in her nature elements of fire and
                  passion, also of endurance and strength. Yet these are common to humanity. She was
                  an orphan, living upon the charities of her aunt.</p>
               <p>Uncle Alph and Aunt Lina Fenn lived in Glenlyn, a pleasant New England village,
                  nestled in a valley, surrounded by half a dozen hills.</p>

               <head>II. THE MORNING BREAKETH.</head>
               <p>MAG opened her eyes the next morning to greet the sunrise: a strange pressure was
                  upon her lids, upon her brain, and upon her heart—a dim remembrance of grief.</p>
               <p>Something weighed down her spirits; it would require an effort to force them to
                  be, as usual, buoyant and elastic. She remembered that once before her heart had
                  been crushed, and she had awoke to the feeling of desolation and bereavement; on
                  that morning she found herself sleeping on her dead mother's bosom. Now, that
                  seemed a terrible dream, as if she had lived in another life, whose shadowy
                  memories visited her. A great gush of pining swept up from her heart.</p>
               <p>"Oh, oh, oh! how she longed and longed to see her mother once more! Her heart
                  would tear itself out, it was so homesick! Would God never, never let her see her
                  mother again? She would ask him. Grandma Walton had told her to ask God for
                  whatever she wanted, and God would love her better for it."</p>
               <p>So she rose, folded her hands, and knelt down, and asked "'Our Father who art in
                  heaven,' to please to let her see her mother again just as soon as he could make
                  it right;" and then she asked him to take care of Willy, and make him come back
                  again, and to help her to be good, so that Aunt Lina wouldn't scold, and so that
                  Frank wouldn't call her a tom-boy any more.</p>
               <p>Then Aunt Lina called. "Come, come, Mag! Hurry up and down, and set the table for
                  breakfast!"</p>
               <p>So down she ran, feeling better for her prayers. She<pb n="18-19"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000010"/> stopped and played with Harry, the baby, even
                  managed to kiss him, cross as he was, and gave herself credit for her self-denial
                  and sacrifice of taste, and then she made herself busy as a bee, and wonderfully
                  useful, till Grandma Walton, who sat in the corner, smiled so benignantly that Mag
                  wondered what had happened.</p>
               <p>The birds were singing in their cages. She thought of Willy, and couldn't help
                  looking sorrowfully away over the house, where she last saw him flying—and a great
                  light flashed into her brown eyes as she looked—for there on the roof the wanderer
                  was sitting—little, tired, repentant Willy. She could hardly contain herself, for
                  excitement, her joy was so eager. Her fingers were tremulous as she held out his
                  cage to him, inviting him in her sweetest bird-prattle, to come home; and he,
                  silly little fellow, fluttered gladly down to his prison-home, and never again
                  went roaming. Like many another wanderer, he had grown tired of liberty with its
                  hardships. Free and glorious as were the ways of the world, he could not pay the
                  price of freedom; his nature was undisciplined, had not been cultivated to enjoy
                  the wild, rough road to independence, and he was too great a coward to accomplish
                  the training necessary to fit him for the blessing of liberty. Mag nearly lost her
                  senses with gladness as she greeted him.</p>
               <p>"Charming, big, nice, old world, out there, isn't it, Willy? Hungry, though, and
                  greedy too!" said she, as he flew eagerly at the seeds in his cage. His bill was
                  stained with green leaves, the forage of his expedition.</p>
               <p>"They don't feed birdies out there with canary seed, do they? And what is worse
                  than all the rest, nobody <emph>loves</emph> them, and the world isn't worth much
                  when there is nobody to love, and nothing in particular to eat."</p>
               <p>"Mag, <emph>you,</emph> MAG! I say!" called Aunt Lina; "come in and put the
                  breakfast on the table, and behave yourself."</p>
               <p>Mag obeyed after a sort.</p>
               <p>"Now don't put the coffee in the cream cup, nor the salt in the sugar bowl,
                  because you've lost seventeen of your senses."</p>
               <p>Mag made a powerful effort to recall her "seventeen" scattered senses, and almost
                  succeeded. She finished breakfast creditably, and ran to feed the chickens.</p>
               <p>"Glad to see me, Speckle-toe?" she chirrupped. Her gladness was obliged to bubble
                  over in some fashion. "Have you been a grand, good chick, little Flibbertigibbet?
                  How many eggs are you going to lay to-day?"</p>
               <p>"Cut-cut-ke-daw-cut," screamed Flibbertigibbet in answer.</p>
               <p>"Cut-cut-ke-daw-cut? I thought so," sung Mag, as she showered him with corn.</p>
               <p>"Cuck-a-doodle-doo-oo!" crowed old Top-knot, strutting up after his share.</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes; I know all about that, old fellow; I learnt it a long time ago. You are
                  getting jealous, I suppose," said she, mocking him. "Great, funny, bouncing world
                  we are in, isn't it, Col. Top-knot? But I'd like to know what business you have
                  eating those bugs and worms? Ugh! Don't you know it hurts them to be eaten
                     <emph>alive?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"But they'll get used to that," whistled Top-knot, complacently.</p>
               <p>"You take it comfortably, old fellow—but what a depraved taste you have; catch me
                  eating worms alive. You'll be sorry for your sins, when your wickedness comes home
                  to you; you'll be eaten yourself, some of these fine days, and I shall be there to
                  see it done."</p>
               <p>And Mag ran in, mocking the canaries, as she wiped the plates for Aunt Lina.</p>
               <p>"Mag alive! What a nest of noises you do raise! I just believe you were born
                  crazy!" commented Aunt Lina.</p>
               <p>"May-be the world went crazy after she was born," suggested grandma, who sat in
                  the corner with Harry, the baby.</p>
               <p>"Once upon a time!" added Mag, laughing at the conceit. Grandma continued:</p>
               <p>"You are almost too much of a music-box, Mag. Little<pb n="20-21"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000011"/> girls, you know, should be seen, and not heard. If
                  you are not crazy you are a born genius, certain."</p>
               <p>Just then Mag stumbled upon Harry, who set up a yell.</p>
               <p>"I believe the young one will drive me distracted with her genius!" exclaimed Aunt
                  Lina, in a fret, pushing Mag off from Harry. Mag ran out in the yard, thinking
                  intently, "That torment of a baby will drive me distracted if the music don't."
                  She found her bat, and commenced playing ball with Sport, her dog.</p>
               <p>"Nice old world, though, if it has gone crazy, isn't it, Sport?" said she, as she
                  tossed the ball upon the cottage roof: when it came down with a bound, she swept
                  it with her bat over the garden fence, almost to Dr. Ross' house, at the south of
                  the garden.</p>
               <p>"There, Sport, off with you! Exercise is good for little dogs, as well as girls.
                  That ball is for you."</p>
               <p>Frank Ross saw the ball too, and started for it, but Sport reached it first, and
                  brought it back with glistening eyes and teeth. He enjoyed the game amazingly.</p>
               <p>"It does little dogs good to laugh, especially sometimes; don't you think so,
                  Sport?" she chattered.</p>
               <p>"And little tom-boys, too," continued Frank, coming up. "You are going to school
                     <emph>with me</emph> this morning, Mag—that is, you <emph>may,</emph> if you'll
                  promise to be good—and we'll go 'round by the brook, there'll be time before
                  school."</p>
               <p>"No, sir! Mr. Frank Ross, I'm not going to school with you any more. You needn't
                  think you're going to call me tom-boy again."</p>
               <p>"W-h-e-w!" whistled Frank. "Wonder what's in the wind now? I'll call you
                     tom-<emph>girl,</emph> then. Will that suit?"</p>
               <p>"No, it won't suit, and <emph>you</emph> don't suit me at all either," said Mag,
                  the clouds gathering over her face and eyes.</p>
               <p>"Yes, indeed, you <emph>are</emph> going to school with me. Why, I'll be as polite
                  to you as—as—</p>
               <p>The clouds deepened and darkened, the eyes flashed.</p>
               <p>"Mag, if you'll go with me, I'll be <emph>powerful</emph> good," said he,
                  softening his tones so that he plead away a part of the pout on her lips, though
                  she saw the comic twinkle of his eye.</p>
               <p>Frank gained his suit, after making a world of promises. They compromised matters
                  and went to school together by way of the brook. It was a beautiful stream,
                  wandering away on one side of Glenlyn, among the mountains. Mag haunted it like a
                  familiar spirit, babbled with it all manner of nonsense in the summer-time, and in
                  the winter skated over its frozen waters, to run races with the winds and Frank
                  Ross. She greeted the waters now as old friends.</p>
               <p>"Glad to see us this brave, bright morning," said she, as, at sight of her, they
                  danced onward, sparkling and flashing smiles up in the sunshine.</p>
               <p>"They are laughing at <emph>you,</emph> Frank," she added with a merry gush,
                  trying to mock them. "Ain't they beauties? The darlings! I must have a game with
                  them before school."</p>
               <p>Which was precisely what Frank expected. She commenced splashing rainbows up in
                  the sunshine.</p>
               <p>"Yes, you'll put the mischief in them, no doubt of that, even if you have to put
                  yourself in, to make it out," said Frank.</p>
               <p>"That very thing I shall do, Mr. Frank," she rejoined saucily, and slipping off
                  her stockings and shoes, she waded in, watching her bare, white feet, among the
                  pebbles. Frank seated himself, as a matter of course, upon the bank, took his
                  fishing-tackle from his pocket, and put an angle-worm on his hook. Mag stopped and
                  watched the operation, making all sorts of wry faces to see the struggles of the
                  worm.</p>
               <p>"I say, Frank," said she with intense pity, "see how the poor fellow squirms. How
                  he does ache, don't he?"</p>
               <p>"I expect he does, Mag, but I can't help him. That was what he was made for. The
                  fish will squirm, too, when he swallows him, hook and all. I just hope a big one
                  will want his breakfast in a hurry this morning."</p>
               <p>"It's so queer we can't <emph>see the pain</emph> in him now. I wonder what shape
                  the pain is, Frank, and what use it is, and where it goes."</p>
               <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6426-00000012"/>
               <p>"Perhaps into the soul of the wayward girl I now see," said Frank, with an
                  imperturbable look at her, meant to be very expressive; "s'pose there's some use
                  in it, or it wouldn't be, for God made it; and if there was any use in our seeing
                  the pain, he'd make us see it."</p>
               <p>Mag turned away, waded to the bank, and pulled a flower-cup that was dipping into
                  the water.</p>
               <p>"Hillo, Mag, how you did hurt that little blue-bell, when you broke its back.
                  Ain't you ashamed of yourself? Don't you see it is bleeding itself to death?"</p>
               <p>"Pooh, Frank, you know it ain't in pain." She looked wistfully up.</p>
               <p>"How do I know it? There may be plenty of pains in it of all sorts and sizes. Of
                  course I can't see'em, but how do I know they ain't there, hey? I just don't know,
                  nor you either. It don't make wry faces and cry, as you would if I broke your back
                  so, but how do I know it don't ache, every inch of it? And I've no doubt there was
                  a fairy asleep in that flower, when you pulled it, and you've tipped her out of
                  bed into the water and she's drowned."</p>
               <p>"No, fairies have wings, and she must have flown away, though I didn't see
                  her—wish I had," said Mag, in grave simplicity.</p>
               <p>Frank looked up with a stare, to discover if she was quizzing.</p>
               <p>"What a grand little simpleton you are, Mag!" Frank fished on with intense
                  complacency.</p>
               <p>"I say, Mag, ain't you afraid I shall fish up a nymph or a mermaid?" he added,
                  hauling up his hook at a nibble. "That was a whopping big bite."</p>
               <p>"'Hem! you needn't think any nymphs or mermaids are going to bite at your
                  angle-worms. They don't eat such stuff."</p>
               <p>"How do you know that?"</p>
               <p>"Grandma says they live down in ocean caves, among the corals, and dance in the
                  silver-mist of the moonshine, and they sleep in shells among the sea-flowers."</p>
               <p>"With all the oysters, and crabs, and such vermin? Can't say that I approve of the
                  company they keep in their sleeping-rooms. I suppose they <emph>eat out</emph> the
                  other inhabitants before they go to sleep."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Frank, what does make you talk so?"</p>
               <p>"Because I'm such a sensible fellow, I suppose."</p>
               <p>Mag turned, climbed up the bank, and over the rocks after some flowers hanging
                  above the water.</p>
               <p>"I love the flowers and the waters, whether there are any fairies or mermaids in
                  them or not," said she, "and what's more, they love me too."</p>
               <p>"I've not a doubt of that!" ejaculated Frank; for just then, "according to
                  custom," as he said, her foot slipped, and she came plunging into the deepest part
                  of the water. The waves gurgled and laughed around her—caught her in their arms,
                  and drew her fondly into their bosom, and she might have slept there forever, if
                  Frank had not plunged after her and forced her from their ravishing embraces.
                  "That's what I call loving not wisely, but a little too well," thought he as he
                  pulled her ashore.</p>
               <p>"I've fished you out, Mag, but you're a funny fish. In fact, I can't quite say,
                  this time, whether you're a fish, a fowl, or a frog. I think I'll carry you to
                  Master Socrates, and he may classify you. You're a splendid specimen."</p>
               <p>"The mermaids wouldn't own me now," she replied, "and I'm in a pretty fix for
                  school! What's to be done with me, Frank?"</p>
               <p>"Better let me hang you up on one of these trees to dry. Let me see if I can't
                  wring you out."</p>
               <p>"How Aunt Lina <emph>will</emph> scold if I go home!" she added, after a few
                  minutes of deep consideration. "I shan't go home. I'll go wet, anyhow; I shall get
                  dry sometime today."</p>
               <p>So she stood on the banks, and permitted the sun to drink the water from her
                  garments, while the sauciest rays were kissing the drops from her hair.</p>
               <p>"Why, Mag, you'll evaporate—you'll go up into the clouds," said Frank, as he saw
                  clouds of mist rising from her.</p>
               <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6426-00000013"/>
               <p>"I may ride a rainbow if I do," said she, trying to be brave, but succeeding only
                  in getting up a dreary smile.</p>
               <p>"You'll make one," said Frank.</p>
               <p>"It will be a forlorn affair, I'm thinking, Frank," said she, monstrously wanting
                  to cry.</p>
               <p>Frank concluded to pity her forlorn condition.</p>
               <p>"You'd make a very respectable one, certain," said he. "Come, let's go on to
                  school. You'll be dry as a fish by school-time."</p>
               <p>"Oh, dear, I hope so!" said Mag, "as dry as <emph>two</emph> of 'em."</p>
               <p>"Any how, we'll have a grand time to-morrow after school; you shall go hunting
                  with me. Don't forget it, now."</p>
               <p>"And will you let me shoot half the time?" asked Mag, her eyes glistening with
                  eagerness.</p>
               <p>"Yes, if you won't plague me."</p>
               <p>And with this dubious parcel of comfort, the two odd atoms of humanity trudged on
                  together toward school. But the next day, as we shall see, it fell out that Mag
                  forgot the engagement.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>III. MAG AT SCHOOL.</head>
               <p>EVERYBODY agreed that Mag was a queer little soul. Aunt Lina declared daily that
                  "she believed the young one was <emph>possessed</emph>—it would take a witch to
                  keep track of her." And Uncle Alph gave his opinion of her in more emphatic than
                  elegant language: "That Mag is one of the d—l's own unaccountables!" And Mag
                  thought that perhaps he measured the "Old Boy's" capacities by his own.</p>
               <p>We would remark that there are many young souls in the world whose inner
                  lives—whose aspirations are in spheres never dreamed of by parents and
                  guardians—which state of affairs is the cause of many of the innumerable
                  heart-aches, misunderstandings, et cetera, peculiar probably to earthly existence,
                  education and development. The discords in Mag's sphere often kept her brain busy
                  solving problems—but the brain was given for action.</p>
               <p>"Dear, dear, what a world of trouble there is!" said she, as she plodded her way
                  to school with Frank. The bath had cooled off her ecstasies amazingly.</p>
               <p>"The world is well enough, I'm thinking," answered Frank, "the best I ever
                  remember to have pitched into, if the <emph>people</emph> in it only knew enough
                  to behave themselves! The <emph>folks</emph> make all the fuss."</p>
               <p>The two reached school in due time.</p>
               <p>As Mag's teacher influenced her development, we must take his portrait for these
                  pages, premising that the portrait is from life.</p>
               <p>Socrates Wilson was of the Ichabod Crane order of pedagogues. Frank thought he had
                  caught the mantle of<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6426-00000014"/> Ichabod himself,
                  when that worthy ascended from this lower sphere. He differed, however, from the
                  elder prophet in many things. He was eccentric—but the embodied spirit of
                  laziness; he was immensely philosophical, and quoted Plato and Aristotle, and
                  talked of gods and divinities; and the villagers, in their simplicity, considered
                  his words Delphic oracles, and watched reverentially all his eccentricities as
                  evidences of the divinity within. Were there not marvellous heaps of knowledge
                  stored away beneath those black, bushy locks? They stood out from his head toward
                  every imaginable point of compass, as if perpetually electrified by the
                  understanding beneath! What scintillations of wit and wisdom shot out from the
                  little, twinkling, black eyes, notwithstanding the shaggy, craggy, beetling cliffs
                  of eyebrows, and the narrow ledge of forehead above.</p>
               <p>Master Socrates was fond of solitary, mystic contemplation—"communion with
                  absolute being, in which thought rejected all determinate thought, and falling
                  back within its own depths, arrived at such oblivion of itself, that consciousness
                  vanished, or seemed to vanish." To him this was ecstasy. Often he dismissed his
                  few disciples to study as peripatetics in the sacred groves of his Academia; and
                  while some, like Mag, were perched in the branches of the trees, conning their
                  lessons in nature and art, and others, like Frank, were angling for mischief and
                  fish in the brook, he dozed away the hours in the schoolroom in mystic
                  contemplation.</p>
               <p>He was a peripatetic philosopher. He took scientific walks amid the "sacred
                  shades" with his students, and conversed with them on "those things in heaven and
                  earth now dreamt of in philosophy." He was wonderfully learned in botany, geology,
                  zoology, conchology, mineralogy, ornithology, etymology and theology, and the
                  young lovers of wisdom brought him clusters of flowers and rocks, shells and
                  insects, beasts and fishes, for analysis.</p>
               <p>On especial half-holidays he invited them to his sanctum sanctorum. It was a
                  solitary cottage, a mile from the academy, under the mountain. The solitary
                  cottage contained little besides a solitary room of miniature dimensions, with its
                  philosophical furniture. The bed nearly filled the floor. At the head of the bed
                  stood a cabinet, the upper half of which was filled with books in many languages;
                  the lower half contained all manner of curiosities, of both natural and unnatural
                  history—piles of rocks, of ancient coin, quantities of stuffed bipeds and
                  quadrupeds, and unstuffed reptiles and insects.</p>
               <p>And the brown rafters were covered with pictures—specimens of his own handicraft,
                  for the master studied practical, as well as ideal aesthetics; he both preached
                  and practised painting. The specimens of the sanctum were done on sheets of
                  foolscap, in mottled water-colors, in a style to have startled the very shades of
                  Raphael and Titian. Well for them that their peaceful ashes were never disturbed
                  by the sight of that rival glory.</p>
               <p>The <emph>crowning</emph> attraction of the sanctum was an immense stuffed
                  rattle-snake, reposing serenely by the side of a scarlet spy-glass, just under the
                  ridge-pole. On propitious nights the spy-glass performed its duty—the academicians
                  were made to see stars, and look for the man in the moon, while Master Socrates
                  expounded and expatiated to them concerning things in heaven above and earth
                  beneath, and the waters under the earth. On these occasions his immense proboscis
                  of a nose seemed to peer forward—to penetrate the future—to prognosticate with
                  mysterious acumen its wonderful secrets, while the skirts of his garments trailed
                  their slow length with characteristic gravity in the rear.</p>
               <p>Mag was at times a special favorite of the master, and then he unfolded to her
                  strange secrets of human nature—especially when he revealed to her pages of
                  heart-history; his conquests among the fair; his <emph>power</emph> over female
                  hearts, reminded Mag of Caesar's "Veni, vidi, vici"—it was equalled only by the
                  son of Venus himself.</p>
               <p>At times, though, Mag became an especial nuisance to<pb n="28-29"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000015"/> him, and then there was a warring of elements; but
                  the sun always shone clearer after storms—a beautiful provision of nature.</p>
               <p>At the age of ten, Mag had been introduced by the master into the primal glories
                  of "la langue Française," and now at the age of twelve she was deep in the
                  conjugating mysteries of "Amo" with Frank. She sat next Frank at the desk. He was
                  her right-hand man, and Josie Newton her nearest left-hand neighbor. The desk of
                  the room was of a primitive fashion; it was one continuous desk, running across
                  three sides of the room, and joining at right angles, so as to form two very
                  luxurious corner seats, that seemed to fit to a nicety the angles in the backs of
                  lazy disciples. This corner seat was the cause of many a quarrel between Mag and
                  Frank. On that day, in a fit of willfulness, she claimed it by right, which was,
                  of course, a bad stroke of female policy. She had not become indoctrinated with
                  that prime principle in human nature which teaches that the unfair sex delight to
                  grant, as favors, to female dependence, those attentions which are never bestowed
                  when demanded. As Mag demanded the seat by <emph>right,</emph> Frank was thereby
                  stirred to oppose her claims; he took the seat by <emph>might,</emph> and Mag
                  found that "might makes right." They kept up a sort of skirmishing for the seat
                  all the morning; at last, when Frank was called up for recitation, Mag secured it.
                  Poor Mag!</p>
               <p>Frank's imperturbable face was stamped with an admirable expression of the most
                  profound and unconscious indifference as he returned—he became suddenly inspired
                  with a desperate attack of mathematical devotion, in which he was so absorbed as
                  not even to notice Mag's triumphant glances; and when at last she got entangled in
                  the horrors of a long sum (alas! mathematics were not her forte), and, as usual,
                  appealed to him to extricate her, he merely lifted his eyebrows with a stare of
                  unparalleled astonishment at her presumption—then shrugged his shoulders, making
                  at the same time a very eloquent gesture, by playing ing an inaudible tune on the
                  air with his fingers, while his thumb was reposing on the tip of his nose,
                  revealing volumes—thus teaching the young lady a lesson which all have to learn
                  sooner or later, viz.: that a prize secured at the sacrifice of peace of mind, of
                  ourselves or others, seldom pays the cost of its acquisition.</p>
               <p>Poor Mag! She was by no manner of means prepared for the contest; she had not
                  calculated her resources; she had no reserved strength for the emergency; she was
                  obliged to surrender after all, and that too on Frank's own terms.</p>
               <p>And yet, dear little soul, she was infinitely happier when she had acknowledged
                  her defeat, and thrown herself on the mercy of her victor—as was natural—for Frank
                  was boiling over with the manly element, and was as magnanimous a conqueror as he
                  was an uncompromising adversary; he showered her with luminous mathematical
                  explanations; shed upon her the rarest floods of light from his saucy, black eyes,
                  and ended his lesson by offering her the contested seat—appreciating fully the
                  truth of that gospel, "It is more blessed to <emph>give</emph> than to
                  receive!"</p>
               <p>Job says, "Man's days are few and full of trouble." Mag found it true all her
                  life-long. Pity that she had not sooner learned the true philosophy of life,
                     <emph>to appreciate fully every blessing of the present;</emph> unheeding those
                     <emph>seeming</emph> blessings beyond the reach; knowing that the grand
                  charm—almost the only charm of forbidden fruit is its being
                  <emph>forbidden</emph>—if once placed within the grasp, it serves as the fruit of
                  Eden served our first mother. Mag proved it in many a life-lesson after this.</p>
               <p>She directly found herself in new trouble from another quarter on this unfortunate
                  day.</p>
               <p>We have said that at times she was an especial torment to the master. She was a
                  rebellious little subject when her passions were aroused. The master himself had
                  never proved the truth of Solomon's proverb—"He that ruleth his spirit is better
                  than he that taketh a city. The idea of his accomplishing either exploit was
                  perfectly mythical to him; he<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6426-00000016"/> could not
                  comprehend it. On one occasion, when he had blamed Mag wrongfully, with insulting
                  severity, and she had answered him with indignant and passionate scorn, she was
                  addressed instanter:</p>
               <p>"Magdalene Barclay, take your books and leave this school, and don't show your
                  face here again."</p>
               <p>Mag's eyes blazed; she rose, walked deliberately up before him, made a sweeping
                  courtesy of mocking deference, retired to the door, repeated her salaam, and then
                  walked home to face the fury of her aunt. However, the affair was arranged in a
                  few days, by the students taking sides with Mag. She was on the "sick list" for a
                  short time, and at last returned, as Aunt Lina said, "with no words about it."</p>
               <p>The <foreign xml:lang="LAT">spiritus domini</foreign> came upon Socrates like an
                  inspiration when it came at all, and when the divine afflatus was kindled, he
                  endeavored to atone for all previous remissness of duty, so he used the rod of
                  government enough in one day of the week, to atone for the other six days'
                  rest.</p>
               <p>But for Mag's next trouble. If there was one thing that she scorned above all
                  others, it was the idea of looking in a book at recitation; she never pirated her
                  lessons in that way; but Josie, her neighbor, considered it lawful to dispose of
                  her lessons in any fashion except by learning them.</p>
               <p>As they were reciting together that morning, Mag saw Josie slily peeping into the
                  book; she made a quick gesture for her to quit it and put the book away. Josie
                  caught the master's eye at the instant, and her book went with a jerk under the
                  desk. The "spirit" of Socrates, like that of Saul, chanced to be on him—he saw the
                  movements.</p>
               <p>"Were you girls looking in your books?" thundered he. Josie was speechless.</p>
               <p>"Come out into the floor, both of you," he commanded.</p>
               <p>Josie began to cry; Mag denied having looked in the book—in vain—he had seen her
                  eager gesture, and was determined to punish her for the transgression. As <hi
                     rend="i"/>prin-<hi rend="i"/>ceps criminis, she was first made to hold out her
                  hand to receive the rod. It was a rosy-looking member after the torture had been
                  inflicted, and the indignant blood was surging rampant with passion through her
                  whole system. Josie might have saved her the punishment by giving the facts of the
                  case, but misery loves company, and so Josie was silent.</p>
               <p>"Will you look into your book <emph>again</emph> at recitation?" echoed Jupiter
                  Tonans, in shrill thunder.</p>
               <p>"I thank you, sir, I have told you that I haven't done it yet," Mag replied, with
                  eyes flashing fiery indignation.</p>
               <p>"Hold out your hand again!"</p>
               <p>Mag obeyed—bore the pain again without flinching, or shedding a tear, and then the
                  question was repeated on a shriller key.</p>
               <p>"Will you look into your book <emph>again</emph> at recitation, I say?"</p>
               <p>"Thank you <emph>very</emph> kindly, indeed, sir; I haven't done it yet." Mag's
                  nostril was quivering with passionate scorn.</p>
               <p>The question was repeated—so was the answer—so was the torture. Six times the
                  punishment was inflicted, and then Mag's fortitude began to fail. Flesh and blood
                  couldn't bear it. She had been reading in French, "Rien est beau, que le vrai."
                     <emph>Truth</emph> alone is beautiful. It was a splendid <emph>theory</emph> to
                  die for truth, but she began to think the <emph>practice</emph> rather painful,
                  and on this occasion martyrdom wouldn't pay. She couldn't, on the whole, see the
                  use in it. Spite of herself, at last, under the excruciating pain, the tears would
                  come; she struggled against them—bit her lips and tongue, but the muscles would
                  quiver; every nerve in her body was raising an insurrection at the stinging
                  torture. The <emph>spirit</emph> was willing to die for truth, but the
                     <emph>flesh</emph> was weak.</p>
               <p>At last came a slight variation to the question. The master was getting doubtful
                  as to the result, and softened his tones, with a dubious question.</p>
               <p>"Will you never look into your book while reciting, Mag?"</p>
               <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6426-00000017"/>
               <p>Mag bolted out a fierce "No," and was released.</p>
               <p>Josie had stood by whimpering, and when the master turned to her, she begged off
                  with such pathetic pleading, and with so many promises that "she would
                     <emph>never</emph> do so any more—no, she <emph>never</emph> would. Please,
                  sir, only let her go this <emph>one</emph> time." The master's heart was
                  touched.</p>
               <p>The blows she received from the birch, "were like angels' visits, few and far
                  between," and gentle, like falling dew. Both returned to their seats meditating on
                  the politics of school, which bear a strong resemblance to the politics of the
                  larger school of life.</p>
               <p>And the next day Mag was astonished to find herself and Josie again in disgrace,
                  paraded in the middle of the floor, on a triangular stick of fuel for a dunce's
                  seat, as objects of scorn, to all curious beholders. They sat in their humility
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">à la Turque,</foreign> for an hour, Mag looking
                  unconcerned; Josie, with a variety of expressions on her pretty face—she could not
                  quite decide which would be most becoming in the emergency, and as Mag's impudence
                  on former occasions had won her popularity, she made some faint attempts to assume
                  a little bravery.</p>
               <p>"Are you not tired of your seat, Mag?" asked the master.</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, sir!" answered Mag, in a tone meant to say that she possessed inherent
                  dignity enough to grace any seat, and was superior to any disgrace.</p>
               <p>"Is your seat pleasant, Josie?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," answered Josie, her eyelids falling. She was sitting on the most acute
                  angle of the triangle.</p>
               <p>"Well, you may enjoy your seats as long as you please," said the master,
                  graciously.</p>
               <p>And they stayed after school with the master to enjoy them to their full
                  satisfaction. The master frequently inquired after their peace of mind, and found
                  them tranquilly appreciating Paul's philosophy, "In whatsoever state I find
                  myself, I have learned therewith to be content." But Josie's share of it was
                  exhausted at last, and she was dismissed. She averted her eyes as she passed Mag;
                  she felt that it was a cowardly desertion.</p>
               <p>And Mag remained there, cross and vexed, feeling a growing contempt for human
                  weakness, and beginning to think that there were some noble qualities of soul in
                  this world, above the recognition of common minds. She began to wonder if she
                  wasn't in the habit of throwing her pearls before swine.</p>
               <p>The master sat by her, reading geology. Mag grew cross enough to wish she could
                  see him boiled in a volcano, like that one pictured between the leaves. He was
                  tired himself, at last, being not a little puzzled to know how to manage her.</p>
               <p>"Will you go now, Maggy?" he asked gently.</p>
               <p>Mag looked up, thunderstruck. A soft <emph>answer</emph> turneth away wrath, said
                  Solomon; so did a soft <emph>question</emph> then.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, <emph>if you please,</emph>" she replied, smilingly</p>
               <p>"Well, good afternoon, then."</p>
               <p>"Good bye, sir," said she pleasantly, as she tripped away.</p>
               <p>On the door-steps she found Frank, fretting with impatience, and then her hunting
                  engagement flashed upon her. Language could not express her regret and
                  disappointment. She had beer wasting golden hours and diamond moments, stringing
                  "pearls" of pride in her humility, while sitting on that abominable angle of a
                  stick, to throw before—what? It was too excruciatingly bad—and Frank was a Job's
                  comforter.</p>
               <p>"If you ain't one <emph>stupid,</emph> Mag, I wouldn't say it. To sit poked up
                  there for three blessed hours, on that three-cornered nuisance, just to show your
                  spirit! I've heard of dunces, who would cut off their noses to spite their faces,
                  and you are one of 'em, <emph>certain!</emph> Just take a fellow's advice now, and
                  never be such a fool again! You haven't <emph>made</emph> one thing by it; and
                  just think of the grand fun we've <emph>lost</emph> by your being obstinate as
                  forty mules!"</p>
               <p>Mag had not a word to say—language failed.</p>
               <p>"And you did the same thing yesterday, taking those<pb n="34-35"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000018"/> whippings. Where was the <emph>use</emph> of your
                  bearing all that, just because Master Socrates thought you'd <emph>lie?</emph> You
                  haven't one grain of common sense, Mag, nor an ounce of wisdom. Why, I've got more
                  in my little finger than you have in your whole body, Mag."</p>
               <p>Mag's ears were tingling with mortification. She wanted to cry, but it was against
                  her principles. Frank saw it.</p>
               <p>"Never mind now, Mag! better luck next time. You'll never be such a goose again.
                  Come on now. We must march in double quick time to make up for it."</p>
               <p>They started across the brook, up the mountain. Frank took the gun from its
                  hiding-place.</p>
               <p>"Grandma tried to raise blue blazes about my taking the gun to school. You know
                  she thinks she must be ruler of all creation."</p>
               <p>Frank considered his grandmother the especial trial of his life, and delivered
                  long and eloquent lectures on her frailties, little reprobate as he was.</p>
               <p>"It was no fault of the young 'uns," he said, "when they didn't respect the old'
                  uns. Old 'uns must make themselves <emph>respectable,</emph> and then the young
                  'uns would respect 'em, 'cause why? then they couldn't help it," which was famous
                  philosophy.</p>
               <p>"I say, Mag, wouldn't she make an out-banging captain of Granny-dears,
                  though?"</p>
               <p>"Grenadiers? What are they?"</p>
               <p>"Soldiers who wear caps, to be sure, so Mr. Webster says. Hey, Mag! wasn't that
                     <emph>smart,</emph> some?"</p>
               <p>"So smart you won't be able to learn of Mr. Socrates much longer, I fear."</p>
               <p>"By the by, Mag, speaking of soldiers, there's to be a bloody revolution in these
                  United States. The Union is going to be dissolved—negroes to have a universal
                  stampede—all creation is going to be turned topsy-turvy, and the end of it will be
                  that—well, I think I shall come up top of the heap, and be King of America. Father
                  says that Congress behaves like a parcel of school-boys, that need a master to
                  whip 'em into reason; and I'll do that, certain, when I'm king."</p>
               <p>"Oh, there's a squirrel, Frank!" exclaimed Mag; "let me shoot! You know you said I
                  might, half the time!"</p>
               <p>"Which half, Mag?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Frank, you <emph>promised</emph> me!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, if you'd <emph>behave;</emph> and haven't you behaved with a vengeance? Kept
                  me waiting forever and a day! You may shoot next time; the gun has been loaded a
                  month, and it will kick like forty mules!"</p>
               <p>Frank shot the squirrel. Mag ran and took it up from the ground, and poured over
                  it a great flood of compassion.</p>
               <p>"Poor, little, bloody fellow! I'm <emph>so</emph> sorry for you! Where has his
                     <emph>life</emph> gone, Frank?"</p>
               <p>"Where was his life a hundred years ago, Mag?"</p>
               <p>"Where would our lives be now if our mothers had never lived, or had died before
                  we were born?"</p>
               <p>"Where was the world, Mag, before it was made? And suppose there never had been a
                  God to make it?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, dear! it puts my head in a whirl to think of it! It ain't a supposable
                  case."</p>
               <p>"There are lots of puzzles that get our heads into a snarl when we try to untangle
                  them. Better let 'em alone, and take the world as we find it."</p>
               <p>"But I can't let them alone. I want to know <emph>why</emph> my father and mother
                  died, and yours didn't; and <emph>why</emph> I must live with Uncle Alph, who
                  loves nobody, and hates me, and with Aunt Lina, who does nothing but scold."</p>
               <p>"Grandma Walton says, 'Because God knew that on the whole it was best for
                  you.'"</p>
               <p>"I can't believe that, Frank; it can't be best to be orphans, or everybody would
                  be born orphans."</p>
               <p>"Just as the flowers are orphans!"</p>
               <p>"I think—and think about it when Aunt Lina is scolding—and think, too, that one of
                  these days I'll run away into the woods, and live with the squirrels, in a cave,
                  to get out of the way."</p>
               <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6426-00000019"/>
               <p>"Go to <emph>housekeeping</emph> with the squirrels and wild cats?
                     <emph>Don't</emph> do it, Mag! You'll starve! Though you might learn to suck
                  your claws!"</p>
               <p>"You needn't laugh, Frank, I'm in earnest."</p>
               <p>"So am I, Mag. On the whole, it's a capital idea—just crooked and queer enough to
                  have crawled out of your brain. And I'll come to visit you when you get settled.
                  You'll tuck me up, in winter, into a bed of leaves, and give me lots of nuts to
                  crack, besides teaching me to suck my paws. There goes one of your family, Mag!
                  Now, fire away!"</p>
               <p>"Bang!" went the gun, and off scampered the squirrel. Mag shot after him, clapping
                  her hands and laughing.</p>
               <p>"No go, this time, Mag. You couldn't hit a cow a rod off by your squinting. I'd
                  risk myself at two rods for a ginger-cake."</p>
               <p>"You see, Frank, the squirrel was so pretty, I didn't want to kill him, so I aimed
                  t'other way! hey, Frank?"</p>
               <p>Here they reached a cool spring, gushing beneath a ledge of rocks, shaded by large
                  oaks, and threw themselves down to rest.</p>
               <p>"Well, Miss Sour Grapes, you stay here awhile, till I go over the hill yonder and
                  shoot a <emph>bear.</emph> I'll be back in half a twinkling."</p>
               <p>And off he marched, leaving Mag pulling mosses, flowers, ferns, and berries, which
                  she wound in wreaths around her head, neck, and waist, so busied with her
                  meditations that she waked at last from her wanderings and reveries, to find the
                  sun going down and Frank away. She hurried back to the spring, in sudden, wild
                  alarm. She called him, there was no answer, and a terrible fear took possession of
                  her. She called again and again, syllabled his name to every breeze, but echo only
                  answered. An almost mortal agony seized her; she fancied his gun had gone off and
                  killed him, or a snake had bitten him—or—or—her brain was teeming with horrid
                  fancies. And, oh, what an agony of love gushed into her heart for him then—she
                  turned faint with passionate longing to see him, if only once again; she staggered
                  on—and on, till, utterly exhausted by emotion, she lay down on a rock and sobbed
                  till she could sob no longer. Passionate, wayward Mag! At last she bethought
                  herself of the great God who could help her, and there on the rock she knelt down,
                  and told him that "her heart was <emph>broken,</emph> and she couldn't live if he
                  didn't find Frank for her. Oh, would he please keep him safe and she would promise
                  to be good and grateful all her life." And while she prayed, soothing rest and
                  peace hushed her grieving heart, she remembered her prayer for Willy's return. As
                  she lay, wearied with passion, her beautiful child-faith nestled into her bosom
                  and comforted her. Well for her if, in after years, she had never lost that loving
                  trust in our Father. In the world wilderness, years afterward, she sent forth the
                  dove over desert and billow, and wandered a long, weary journey, before it
                  returned to her with its blessed comfort—the olive branch of faith and peace.</p>
               <p>As she roused herself, she met Frank. He had been looking for her over hill and
                  dale. Not for an instant had God forgotten either of his children.</p>

               <head>IV. GRANDMOTHER.</head>
               <p>THERE was no denying it, Mag was a tom-boy, "the oddest mortal compound that ever
                  breathed," Aunt Lina said. Mag was terribly grieved about it, after Frank had so
                  unceremoniously opened her eyes, and she made desperate efforts to reform with
                  desperate success. God had given her a mind to expand by action. He had also given
                  her a perfect physical nature—restless muscles and nerves, and full pulses—they,
                  too, found life and development in action. She endeavored to make herself very
                  ladylike; but she had propensities that she forgot to control. Sometimes she found
                  herself running races across the tops of the pews in the lecture-room of the
                  academy. She was cured of that propensity by a fall, in which she was knocked
                  breathless and senseless, besides nearly breaking half a dozen ribs on the top of
                  the pew over which she went headlong. Again, she nearly broke her head in
                  attempting to slide down the ice-covered flight of steps, leading to the
                  lecture-room. At an other time she was seized with a fancy for sailing through the
                  air, which feat was accomplished with a pole in her hands as a lever. She was
                  cured of this by taking a leap from a high fence, where her dress caught on the
                  end of a rail. Springing with her full momentum, the other end of the rail acted
                  as a fulcrum, also, and the opposition levers, with their counteracting forces,
                  sent her little body on a grand flight, but it also upset the centres of gravity
                  and motion; she landed upon her ribs and lay breathless till her passion for
                  flying leaps was entirely extinguished.</p>
               <p>There was a ledge of rocks upon the hillside, near the academy, over which some
                  fine sycamores were growing, on whose branches it was her delight to swing. The
                  cold bath with Josie did not quench her ardor in the least—another lesson was
                  needed to cure her of that passion.</p>
               <p>"You'll break your obstinate little neck there yet, Mag," said Frank to her one
                  day, as she went flying over the precipice, clinging with her fingers to the end
                  of a limb, "and here's somebody that won't lift a finger to mend it for you."</p>
               <p>"You'd try to mend it the first thing, Frank; and just <emph>do</emph> see how
                  nice it swings now!" and off she sailed again.</p>
               <p>"If you wasn't so everlasting headstrong, I would say your cranium was a little
                  cracked, Mag."</p>
               <p>"Oh, how funny that speech was, Frank. Didn't it affect your brain some to think
                  it up?"</p>
               <p>"Don't you see, Mag, that limb is splitting down from the trunk."</p>
               <p>"But just look at this, Frank," she said, springing with her whole force—and Frank
                  next saw her lying on the rock just above the precipice, with the broken limb
                  above her. He ran to her.</p>
               <p>"I told you, you'd break your neck, and now you've <emph>done it,</emph>" said he,
                  lifting her in his arms.</p>
               <p>"No, I'm not hurt," she said, smiling and trying to lift her head from the rock;
                  but as she staggered to her feet, her brain reeled, she turned deathly sick, and
                  Frank laid the paling face upon his shoulder, his mischievous eyes glistening with
                  something besides fun.</p>
               <p>"Lie down, Mag, you little harum scarum thing. Your head is covered with blood. I
                  guess you'll believe its cracked now."</p>
               <p>The schoolboys and girls came gathering in crowds. One of the older girls laid the
                  giddy head upon her lap, while Frank ran and brought water in his cap, to bathe
                  the white face and wash off the blood. She tried to raise herself again, but her
                  head felt as if it had been a cannon-ball on her shoulders, it was so heavy; she
                  opened her eyes, but the sunshine looked sickly, and, somehow, the trees above
                     her<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6426-00000021"/> acted strangely, dancing with all
                  kinds of grotesque manœuvres; and the sky, too, was falling, or heaven and earth
                  coming together. She was in tribulation, and so were her schoolmates. At last, a
                  kind neighbor, passing in his buggy, saw the distress, took her in his arms, and
                  drove home with her and gave her into charge of grandma and Aunt Lina.</p>
               <p>For several days, her existence was very dream-like, and Frank told her,
                  afterward, that "during that time there were more queer crotchets rigadooning in
                  her cracked head than could be stuffed into forty nutshells with the tightest sort
                  of squeezing."</p>
               <p>Aunt Lina found this a case beyond the reach of fretting; words failed, and, in
                  desperation, she was silent. She gave Mag over to grandma.</p>
               <p>And such nursing as she received! Mag forever remembered grandmothers as blessed
                  institutions. Grandmother's room was to her a haven of refuge in times of disaster
                  and tribulation that tried the soul.</p>
               <p>It was a large, airy room, and as Mag was convalescing, she discovered nice little
                  nooks by the windows, shaded by the locusts, where the canaries where singing. At
                  times her heart went bubbling over, and she warbled choruses with the birds, while
                  grandma sat smiling at the music, with an old volume of the Spectator in her lap;
                  and Billy Jack, the cat, enthroned in her best rocking-chair, purred for an
                  accompaniment some old-time story.</p>
               <p>Grandma Walton had a cultivated mind, and refined tastes, and she entertained Mag
                  during her convalescence with an infinite series of fairy tales, to which Mag
                  listened with intent eagerness. There was a very pointed moral to each story; all
                  reckless, disobedient fairies met with terrible mishaps, disasters, and
                  punishments, while only the careful and obedient received rewards of love and
                  honor.</p>
               <p>At last Mag was well enough to go out and breathe the fresh air on the hills
                  again, with Frank and Alec. "Was it not grand? And she was cured forever, she
                  thought, of being a tom-boy!"</p>
               <p>"What are you doing now, child?" asked grandma one day, in her soft, pleasant
                  voice, lifting her spectacles over her cap border.</p>
               <p>Mag was seated on the floor in the corner of the room, in the midst of an
                  incongruous heap of old stockings, boots and india-rubber shoes. She was cutting,
                  tearing, twisting, ravelling and winding on what seemed an interminable thread of
                  mysteries entangled in all—as absorbed in tracing it as if life depended on her
                  work. She drew a long breath and looked up—something was wrong.</p>
               <p>"Please, grandma, do fix this ball for me. The cover stretches every which way. I
                     <emph>can't</emph> fix it good out of such an old, twisted boot-leg as this one
                  Uncle Alph gave me. It plagues me more than a little. His foot made it screwshawed
                  and crank-sided I think! so the stitches won't stay. Do look at 'em. I can't
                     <emph>make</emph> 'em stay. It's awful!"</p>
               <p>"I know a little girl about twelve years old who plagues me more than a little,"
                  answered grandma, in benignant tones. "I should like to know what business it is
                  of yours to be making balls?"</p>
               <p>"Why, Frank knocked the cover off my old one yesterday, and then I made a mistake
                  and swept it into the brook instead of the garden, and between us both, you see,
                  it got murdered, and then drowned, poor thing; so I'm obliged to have a new
                  one."</p>
               <p>"There is no end to the troubles you have, is there, child? You are the most
                  unfortunate little girl I know. Let me see what can be done for you."</p>
               <p>And up got Mag, shaking herself free from the accumulated fragments, as Aphrodite
                  rose and shook herself free from the foam of the sea.</p>
               <p>"Why, Mag, alive! look at your frock!" exclaimed grandma. "How did you tear that
                  so?"</p>
               <p>Mag looked down in dubious concern at a big rent in her dress.</p>
               <p>"You see, grandma, Frank and Alec and I went over<pb n="42-43"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000022"/> Broad Hill after grapes this morning, and I tore
                  that climbing the grape-vines."</p>
               <p>"But what business had you climbing grape-vines with Frank and Alec?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I was <emph>obliged</emph> to, grandma, 'cause they didn't have any apron,
                  you know, to hold the grapes; and I filled my bonnet too, and Alec and Frank
                  filled their hats <emph>brimming</emph> full. Aunt Emma and Aunt Lina are going to
                  make lots of jelly out of 'em."</p>
               <p>"Out of the hats, or your torn frock, Mag?"</p>
               <p>"I'm going to mend the frock, grandma, just as soon as I've managed the outrages
                  in this ball."</p>
               <p>"That is no way to do, child. Mend your dress first, and the ball, I have no
                  doubt, will behave admirably. Any sensible ball would have been outraged to see a
                  little girl at work or play with a torn dress. That ought <emph>first</emph> to be
                  mended."</p>
               <p>"Oh, dear! It is so tiresome to mend dresses, grandma! And my dresses won't stay
                  mended. As fast as I sew one hole, another one gets torn, and I'm
                  discouraged."</p>
               <p>"Yes, but do you run this minute and mend it. The ball will persist in being
                  unfixable till the dress is right. I'll try to persuade the ball to do its duty
                  while you are doing yours. <emph>Duty</emph> before pleasure, <emph>always;</emph>
                  my little girl <emph>must</emph> remember that."</p>
               <p>"Yes, grandma; and your fingers being stronger than mine, that ball cover will be
                  obliged to understand. You shall teach it manners. We shall both behave correctly,
                  with you to help us."</p>
               <p>Grandma took the ball in her hands, with very soft eyes.</p>
               <p>"That's the way exactly, I know," said Mag, bounding off to mend the dress before
                  Aunt Lina could catch a glimpse of it.</p>
               <p>Mag mended the rent, while grandma "persuaded" the ball cover to fit. Mag took it,
                  and went to chatter about <emph>duty</emph> to the birds and squirrels. She must
                  teach them the lessons she learned. Back she came in great trouble, and threw
                  herself into grandma's lap, sobbing:</p>
               <p>"Bunny has killed Susy! Grandma, Bunny has killed Susy!"</p>
               <p>"Bunny killed Susy? Oh, no, Mag! <emph>How</emph> could he?"</p>
               <p>"He just broke her neck in the wheel. He was always bad tempered! He did it out of
                  spite! Do come and look! You never saw the like!"</p>
               <p>Grandma went. Yes, Susy hung dead in the entrance to the wheel-room. The criminal
                  was still in the wheel, and behaving very strangely; he evidently felt conscience
                  smitten, Mag said.</p>
               <p>"Well, I can't remedy this, Mag. Susy is past all her trouble now; but there is no
                  end to your trouble, is there?"</p>
               <p>"If there is," said Mag, "I never have seen it yet."</p>
               <p>"You never will see it in this world, child," said grandma, sadly. "And what you
                  must do with it always is, <emph>bear it patiently</emph> when you can't cure
                  it."</p>
               <p>Frank visited her every day after her fall. He came while they were discussing the
                  disaster that afternoon. Grandma gave him the details in her own style.</p>
               <p>"Susy was a young wife—a foolish one—as most young wives are; and during the
                  honeymoon she did nothing but quarrel with Bunny."</p>
               <p>"Awful to think of!" groaned Frank.</p>
               <p>"Instead of becoming meek and obedient, her contrariness seemed to grow upon
                  her—as faults usually do grow when people indulge them. No matter if Bunny was
                  tyrannical; her obstinacy, instead of softening him, made him worse. And now see
                  what has come of it. Bunny has broken her neck."</p>
               <p>"And if little, <emph>high-flying</emph> girls—(oh, Mag, I hope you see I made a
                  distracting pun)—if they would be less obstinate and obey their
                     <emph>superiors,</emph> they would not get their necks broken, or their heads
                  damaged," Frank said pointedly.</p>
               <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6426-00000023"/>
               <p>Grandma continued:</p>
               <p>"If Susy had yielded gently to his whims, she might have coquetted and bewitched
                  his heart away from him without his knowledge. But like all lords of creation, he
                  refused to be driven to terms, and there came serious family difficulties from the
                  most trifling causes. Mag tried to arrange them; but, alas! during her absence
                  they turned belligerent—there came an outbreak—Susy must needs have her paws in
                  Bunny's affairs—must intrude her nose in his business-world"——</p>
               <p>"Of cracking nuts!" Mag whispered to Frank.</p>
               <p>"He set that world into a <emph>whirl,</emph> on account of it."</p>
               <p>"And so Susy has found other nuts to crack," finished Frank.</p>
               <p>"And the <emph>moral?</emph>" grandma asked.</p>
               <p>"Boys, girls, and squirrels must mind their own business, and so forth, if they
                  don't they will find the world in a whirl around them, and they'll have nuts to
                  crack that will give them wry faces. Isn't it so, Mag?" Frank asked, as he pinched
                  dimples in her cheeks and lips with his saucy fingers.</p>
               <p>They went out to order the funeral ceremonies. During the performances, Bunny
                  acted the part of disconsolate widower, with a wistful look in his eye, that was
                  very touching and appropriate.</p>
               <p>Frank always had said that "Mag was addicted to periodical attacks of philosophy.
                     <emph>Thought,</emph> in her brain, he supposed, got pressed by the temperature
                  up to boiling point, when the philosophy, like gas, escaped from the safety-valve,
                  which was all correct, it keeping the engine from blowing up, and no danger of
                  damage at all to other people."</p>
               <p>Mag went into one of these reveries, after the funeral—the philosophy took a
                  biblical, not to say a theological turn. Frank and Mag had learned to be
                     <emph>free</emph>-thinkers, on Bible topics. They learned their license from
                  Dr. Ross, a professed Universalist; that is to say, Dr. Ross had for a creed,
                  that, "God was infinitely too good to send any created being into endless
                  punishment; moreover, mankind was too good, by far, to be forever damned." A creed
                  which of course gives license to evil by permitting it to wear the raiment of
                  glory. If the tempter ever comes to men arrayed otherwise than as an angel of
                  light, men reject him. Men love evil, only when they deem it good. So many a
                  philosopher has taught. Cousin, the Eclectic, teaches, that all <emph>false</emph>
                  creeds contain <emph>partial truths;</emph> men embrace the creeds only for their
                     <emph>truth.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Carlyle pronounces Mahomet a prophet, acknowledges him to be the <emph>seer</emph>
                  he called himself, because he <emph>saw</emph> one great <emph>truth,</emph>
                  written in letters of light, on the pages of Nature. In pagan darkness his
                  far-seeing eye read the one truth—<emph>there is a God,</emph> who has made the
                  universe, and who governs it. Mahomet proclaimed the <emph>truth</emph> he saw,
                  and in proclaiming it, became what he claimed to be, the <emph>apostle</emph> of
                  the one God. "The <emph>truth</emph> in the creed gave Mohammedanism its
                     <emph>life,</emph>" says Carlyle, "its errors are the germs of disease and
                  decay, which, preying upon its vitals, are full surely bringing it down to death.
                  Error is suicidal in all its tendencies. It has mingled disease even amid the
                  God's truth of Christianity." Bryant says, <q>

                        <l>"Truth crushed to earth will rise again,</l>

               <p>But my pen is wandering. Let it return to the memories of childhood. To every
                  heart, "weary long ago," of passionate wandering, childhood's scenes of joy and
                  sorrow are purifying.</p>
               <p>"There are some things that Adam and Eve never experienced," said Mag, as she came
                  out of her reverie.</p>
               <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6426-00000024"/>
               <p>"Lots of 'em," said Frank. "Never buried any squirrels, for instance."</p>
               <p>"Never had any grandma to comfort 'em, if they did. Eve never had a cousin Frank,
                  as I have; they were never little boys and girls."</p>
               <p>"Getting into 'no end' of scrapes, and having grandma Barclay after them like the
                  mischief, with doses of 'particular Jesse,' to be taken on the raw skin, without
                  sweetening or poulticing," added Frank. "And they never played
                  <emph>four</emph>-old-cat in Eden; 'cause why? how could they, when there were
                  only two of them outside of the sarpent?"</p>
               <p>"And," said Mag, "no grandma to mend their torn balls. Ain't you sorry for 'em,
                  Frank? no boot-legs to make covers for new ones, for they went barefoot. But they
                  had no torn frocks to mend, for they had none to wear—which must have been
                  convenient."</p>
               <p>"And the lady never had a chance to wear the trowsers."</p>
               <p>"And they never cut their fingers, nor broke their toes, nor bruised their
                  noses—or if they did, never had a scrap of salve, or a thimbleful of plaster, or a
                  shadow of a grandma to cure their broken heads, or sweeten trouble with
                  candy."</p>
               <p>"No sir-ee!" said Frank, emphatically. "When they got into trouble they went so
                  deep that all the grandmas in creation couldn't help 'em out."</p>
               <p>"If they hadn't eaten that apple, Frank, where do you suppose we should be
                  now?"</p>
               <p>"That's a <emph>question,</emph> Mag—a real <emph>poser.</emph> We should never
                  have known our grandmothers, <emph>certain,</emph> and we should have missed
                  considerable that's worth living for. On the whole, I'm not sorry they eat it; are
                  you?"</p>
               <p>"But, Frank, ain't it wicked to say so?"</p>
               <p>"Hem—is it any worse to say it, than <emph>think</emph> it? And I
                     <emph>think</emph> it mighty strong all the time. We should have missed
                  considerable if we had never been born. And about that apple eating, too. It's my
                  opinion, that if God had thought it best, <emph>on the whole,</emph> for them not
                  to have eaten it, he wouldn't have let 'em done it. He could have prevented 'em;
                  he is all-powerful; he knew from before the foundations of the world they would do
                  it, for he is all-knowing. God never made a <emph>mistake</emph> about it;
                     <emph>certain</emph> he knew all the time, what <emph>ought</emph> to be. And
                  all creation is in just the fix that it ought to be, for God fixed it, or
                  permitted it to be fixed, because it <emph>ought to be</emph>—it was <emph>best as
                     it is,</emph> in his opinion; and his opinion is wiser than mine. If mine is
                  wrong, why it's a melancholy <emph>fact,</emph> Mag, that I can't help."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Frank, you are getting my wits into a perfect snarl Do let's talk about
                  something that won't puzzle my brain so! It's in a whirl."</p>
               <p>"Grandmas are the most interesting class of people in the world," Frank pronounced
                  with immense gravity.</p>
               <p>"I know that."</p>
               <p>"You do, Mag? <emph>How</emph> do you <emph>know</emph> it? There are as many as
                  several kinds of people in the world, whom you have never met."</p>
               <p>"But the people I have met are precisely like those I haven't met, and I'll assure
                  you, that I think grandmas the best of 'em."</p>
               <p>"Then you think, surely, all mankind were cut out after one pattern?</p>
               <p>"Why, Frank, everybody judges of what they don't know by what they do know."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Every</emph>body! How do you know what everybody does, you little mouse? If
                  they do it, they make some wonderful mistakes. Do you remember that silly little
                  fellow, the mouse in the meal-chest, that looked out into a large
                     <emph>room</emph> and lost his senses in astonished admiration at the enormous
                  size of the world? O Mag, you are an ignoramus! You'll be wiser one of these days,
                  pussy, if you'll mind what I say, and behave well. You'll get your wits sharpened,
                  and love people better than your grandmother."</p>
               <p>"Grandma says <emph>experience</emph> is the best teacher, and she ought to
                  know."</p>
               <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6426-00000025"/>
               <p>"Experience! And you've <emph>experienced</emph> a grandmother?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, <emph>two</emph> of 'em; and so have you, Mr. Frank, and everybody else in
                  this world; besides four great grandmothers, and eight great, great grandmothers,
                  and so on up."</p>
               <p>"You don't say so, Mag! What an amount of arithmetic you have learned. Master
                  Socrates ought to be proud of you. Just figure out for me, now, how much the
                  grandmothers of Mr. and Mrs. Cain and Abel amounted to."</p>
               <p>"I say, Frank, please do speak reverently of those Bible people. I know it's wrong
                  to talk about 'em so."</p>
               <p>"Why, Mag, I never could see where they were one whit better than other folks,
                  especially Cain. Some of the good ones did lots of wicked things."</p>
               <p>"Let's have a game of ball, Frank. Grandma has just finished me a new one, and my
                  fingers are aching to try it."</p>
               <p>And so they closed the exercises of the day.</p>

               <head>V. EXPERIENCES.</head>
               <p>ON other subjects than the Bible, our young disciples became
                  <emph>free</emph>-thinkers. Nature had not endowed Frank with overmuch reverence,
                  even for his superiors, and he had too little regard for inferiority and mental
                  weakness, even in his elders. He said that "he despised a coward and a hypocrite
                  in his very soul." Yes; and in that very soul—full of contempt for meanness and
                  littleness—was all honor and worship, manifested in his reckless, headlong,
                  overbearing way, for everything which he considered noble and honorable.</p>
               <p>It is a sad thing for eager, restless spirits like Frank's, to be thrown into
                  daily contact and companionship with weakness, being, at the same time, commanded
                  to venerate it, as we venerate the beautiful, the good and true. Frank and Mag
                  learned, by such companionship, to take large license while discussing human
                  nature in its glory and shame. If it was wrong, they declared "it was no fault of
                  theirs—they just couldn't help it!"</p>
               <p>It is a "melancholy fact" that Young Americans, in these days, are in the habit of
                  carrying their <emph>liberty</emph> of speech into license. They carry their
                  independence of opinion into the discussion of the faults of their parents and
                  guardians; but those parents and guardians give them the example by discussing
                     <emph>freely</emph> the faults and imperfections of spiritual pastors, and all
                  the "powers that be," in church or state. This condition of things, is, of course,
                  productive of evil as well as good. Liberty is liable to abuse, it<pb n="50-51"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000026"/> becomes license. It is difficult to find the via
                  media—the golden mean—and so men go on, vibrating from one extreme to another of
                  evil and good. Action and reaction being equal, the earth is not thrown from its
                  orbit—philosophy and religion are not swept entirely out of their spheres—and
                  human nature continues, as from its first stages of depravity, a mingling of
                  physical, spiritual and intellectual forces, so interwoven that their life cannot
                  be divided or separated. Men's actions depend upon the force
                     <emph>predominating</emph> in the times that try their souls.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>Human nature</emph> was a subject on which Frank and Mag indulged themselves
                  in both liberty of thought and speech. Grandma Barclay was the especial theme for
                  Frank's eloquence. Uncle Alph, rather more than Aunt Lina, was Mag's problem.</p>
               <p>The Sabbath was a day whose arrangements were a discomfort for both; there was
                  nothing blessed in the home institution with them.</p>
               <p>Grandma Barclay on that day "fulfilled her duty" to Frank. She warned him that "he
                  was a terribly wicked boy, and in great and awful danger of being sent to burn in
                  everlasting fire, with all liars and murderers." Frank often tried to evade this
                  Sunday lesson. Sometimes, in sheer and reckless wantonness, declared he must "try
                  and provoke the patience of the <emph>saint</emph>—it was well to keep her
                  patience in good practice." Sometimes he did it, being himself provoked to
                  desperation, for he respected neither her judgment nor her religion.</p>
               <p>One day, after listening to what he called her "sanctimonious tirade about
                  hell-fire," he declared to her that "he hadn't the slightest idea of ever
                  permitting himself to be roasted or grilled alive in any such absurd way." Grandma
                  held up her hands in holy horror. Grandpa interfered, and tried to persuade her
                  not to "fulfill her duty to Frank—she did it with more zeal than knowledge—she was
                  doing the boy harm, for she was hardening his heart." Grandma insisted that if he
                  wasn't warned of his sin and danger, it shouldn't be her fault. She would free the
                  skirts of her <emph>garments</emph> from his blood."</p>
               <p>Frank, the reprobate, whispered to Alec, that "the 'garments' mentioned must be
                  grandpa's <emph>pants.</emph> She had worn them ever since his remembrance. As he
                  had a regard for grandpa, he would try, for his sake, to keep all splotches of his
                     <emph>blood</emph> from said <emph>garments.</emph>" Frank had more regard for
                  Grandfather Barclay than for any other human being.</p>
               <p>On Sunday, Mag, too, listened to long lectures on her short comings. There was a
                  sad list of them, and on Sunday, Aunt Lina enlarged zealously on every point, for
                  her reformation.</p>
               <p>"She was so busy every week-day," she said, "she didn't have time to see to the
                  young 'un. She did believe in her soul, Mag was bound to disgrace everybody that
                  had anything to do with her. She was so headstrong, stubborn, self-willed and
                  obstinate, that an angel would be puzzled in trying to manage her."</p>
               <p>The good lady was really worried and troubled at the strange specimen Providence
                  had thrown upon her hands. "If Mag hadn't been her own brother's child, she never
                  would have another thing to do with her." In her fussy, storming way, she labored
                  hard for Mag's redemption, and accomplished some harm as well as some good.</p>
               <p>As the years went on, we are sorry to say, that under all these influences, Mag's
                  spirit grew diseased. <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"I hate describing people mad,</l>
                        <l>For fear of seeming touched myself,"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> but I must describe the first symptoms of Mag's disease, and trace its
                  development as far as possible.</p>
               <p>It was the <emph>spirit</emph> that developed <emph>awry.</emph> Her
                     <emph>physical</emph> nature expanded into perfect health and symmetry, in her
                  wanderings over moor and mountain. With Frank Ross' companionship and tuition, her
                     <emph>intellectual</emph> nature grew<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6426-00000027"/>
                  strong and free. From Frank she received both the drill and inspiration which give
                  health; but at home her <emph>spirit</emph> became tainted. It was a proud young
                  spirit, and passionate as proud, and <emph>sensitive.</emph> It had wonderful
                  capacities for loving and hating, for intense joy and sorrow. In that
                  home-atmosphere it breathed a miasma; instead of rejecting it for poison the
                  spirit absorbed it, and permitted itself to become diseased.</p>
               <p>As we have intimated, Uncle Alph was by no manner of means, a symmetrical soul. It
                  was his misfortune that he was not—it was also his <emph>fault,</emph> for we are
                  the "framers of our own destinies." He was one of those unfortunates who seem to
                  be forever <emph>too late</emph> for good luck. He considered himself an unlucky
                  soul, born for bad luck. Energetic souls <emph>know</emph> that there is no such
                  thing as luck. "The heart makes its own fate." The brave, earnest heart
                     <emph>will</emph> control circumstances, and <emph>force</emph> fate to become
                  propitious. Frank and Mag discussed Uncle Alph's faults and opinions freely, and
                  came to their own conclusions. They decided that the secret of his "bad luck" lay
                  in the fact that "all his <emph>fore</emph>thought came
                  <emph>after</emph>wards."</p>
               <p>Uncle Alph worked hard, but never accomplished anything, because there was no plan
                  to his business. He was always behindhand, always in debt, and always soured
                  against the world in consequence thereof.</p>
               <p>Besides this, he had never learned to control his temper; his heart was naturally
                  amiable enough. When all went well with him, he was kind and pleasant; but
                  business never went well with him. As he was controlled by circumstances, it was
                  very rarely that he overtook his business arrangements enough to find opportunity
                  to be kind-hearted. He was always chafed, always in a fret, and, alas, vented his
                  spleen on everything around him! Even his horses and cattle suffered torments from
                  his cruelty, and seemed to partake of his temper. This was all wrong, of course.
                  We give it as one of the "melancholy facts" of human life. He brought this soured,
                  fretting temper into the home life. With him there was never any gentleness. He
                  was stern—never gave a loving caress—was never known to speak a playful word to
                  little children—never petted his own baby son—never was known to bestow upon him
                  even a kiss—and seemed ashamed to have it supposed that he could manifest
                  affection toward his wife. There was no home-love in his presence—nothing to
                  develop the beautiful kindliness that makes home a refuge and a heaven. There was
                  a hardening of the heart, instead of an expansion of sweet affections. In this
                  atmosphere Mag's spirit grew morbid. She <emph>lived</emph> only when she escaped
                  from it. Because of it she pondered many things in her heart, and at times
                  sorrowful eras came in her young life, and her child faith in God became
                  clouded.</p>
               <p>It was Sunday. The home-atmosphere was black with cloud and storm. Aunt Lina had
                  given one of her most scathing lectures on Mag's evil doing—had enlarged upon her
                  sins of omission and commission; waxed eloquent on her crime of ingratitude to her
                  benefactors, who had taken her an outcast; upbraided her with her orphanage and
                  miserable dependence. The tones of the church bell, pealing through the valley,
                  the call to the worship of the living God, broke in upon the storm. And Mag went
                  up to the house of God, and while God's minister gave the Word of Life to the
                  people, she was racking her very heart-strings with desires for freedom. Her fancy
                  labored with a thousand wild images. Imagination was busy with the old dream of a
                  life alone in the forests. It was her only refuge, the only way of escape. Would
                  to God the ravens would bring her food as they did the prophet; she would be free
                  as the ravens.</p>
               <p>All that day the hours passed in gloomy desperation, without one sigh of gratitude
                  to the Our Father for the boon of life. When she heard the benediction, it fell on
                  her heart like mockery, and she went home with thought rampant.</p>
               <p>Aunt Lina received her with renewed maledictions; poured upon her youthful
                  depravity most scorching anathemas<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6426-00000028"/>
                  themas, and Mag only wondered if the day was not a fit type of the miserable
                  eternity to which Aunt Lina consigned her for her sins. Uncle Alph was in most
                  savage humor. Mag panted to escape the stifling atmosphere; it suffocated her. She
                  took a book, the letters danced before her eyes into grotesque, meaningless
                  syllables. She finally led little Harry out under the locusts, looked up into the
                  clouded heavens, wondered if indeed the everlasting sunshine was above the clouds,
                  and a God beyond the sunshine, whose smile was eternal. She tried to throw off the
                  maddening depression of her spirits, by talking to the birds in their cages. Her
                  Puritan training had taught her that it was wicked to even talk in the bird
                  language on the Sabbath. She was awakened from her bitterly sad employment by a
                  shock like lightning. Uncle Alph had come suddenly upon her, and she was aroused
                  by a savage blow from a switch, a broken grape-vine, that left her hand and arm
                  bleeding, wherever it touched the skin. The blow was accompanied by words as
                  cruel, and tones as fierce.</p>
               <p>"Get into the house, you young fool! never let me catch you again out
                     <emph>playing on Sunday.</emph>"</p>
               <p>As she turned she met his eye glaring lightning. He had lost all control of his
                  temper—given himself up to the sway of the spirit. It was the drop in Mag's full
                  cup of desperation. She lifted a fearless eye, and returned his lightning glare,
                  but her tongue was silent. Her lip curled and her nostril dilated in indignant
                  scorn, at the brutal cruelty. She entered the door, the very intensity of her
                  passion kept her calm; she took her bonnet, walked out of the house, and turned
                  her steps toward the mountains. When she was entirely alone, free from the fear of
                  pursuit, thought went mad. She ran to keep pace with her passion—went bounding on,
                  and on, and at last, breathless, utterly exhausted, she threw herself upon the
                  mossy rock at Glenlyn Falls, and gave full sweep to her frantic thought. Her brain
                  went wild; chains of fire seemed to bind her; tongues of flame fired veins and
                  pulses; lightning seemed to be flying ing over bare quivering nerves, thrilling
                  through bone and marrow, the thought swept over her with such intolerable
                  anguish.</p>
               <p>"No, no, no. There was no God in the universe! It was all a lie; the story of the
                  loving Christ, and the great Our Father."</p>
               <p>Yet the "great, calm Christ" was watching the child, with his <emph>loving</emph>
                  eye, as she writhed like a crushed worm in the desert.</p>
               <p>"Why—<emph>why</emph>—WHY was she ever born? It was a God of evil, not of good,
                  who ruled the destinies of men and little children, who had forced her to be born
                  without her wish or will; life was worse than a worthless boon—it was an
                  unmitigated curse."</p>
               <p>And the birds went on singing in the trees, and the winds whispered and dallied
                  among the sporting leaves, and the sunshine broke out of a rift in the cloud, and
                  streamed down upon her; it tried to find an entrance into the quivering heart, but
                  she closed the portals against it.</p>
               <p>"Why could she not be annihilated? Dead—dead—dead forever?"</p>
               <p>Then came thoughts of her mother.</p>
               <p>"Was that all, too, a grand lie—the tale they told her, that her mother was
                  living, up beyond those lowering clouds? Was there no way in which she might reach
                  her? No path up yonder? Could not she herself tear her own spirit out of her own
                  flesh? Or was neither the flesh nor the spirit her own?"</p>
               <p>Her spirit was tearing madly at its prison-bars.</p>
               <p>"What if she should throw herself from the rocks, down into the water below? What
                  would come of it? What of the spirit then?"</p>
               <p>Aye, Mag, what then?</p>
               <p>She crept to the verge of the precipice, looked down where the waters were boiling
                  over the crags. They danced, and foamed, and shone; her dizzy head grew<pb
                     n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6426-00000029"/> dizzier with the whirl of waters below,
                  and that in her brain—confused sounds broke upon her senses, a faintness came upon
                  her—it came with a peaceful hush, soft and sweet as balm. A smile stole over her
                  face, as over the face of a baby sleeping in its mother's bosom. She gave a long,
                  sobbing sigh as she closed her eyes to <emph>rest.</emph>
                  <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Rest more soft and still, than ever nightfall gave,</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"Was it her mother's spirit whispering to her? Was God indeed the Our Father? Was
                  he answering her wild, bitter prayer? Was this the death for which her heart was
                  thirsting so wildly? Going to her mother at last?"</p>
               <p>She looked up to see if there were not angels in the sky, and as she looked,
                  heaven and earth swam before her, in thousands of beautiful colors; then the light
                  faded, her senses forsook her, but a radiant smile of heaven-peace crept up out of
                  her heart and fed upon her pale lips.</p>
               <p>No, it was not Death who visited her, nor Sleep, the brother of Death. It was a
                  visitor sterner than Sleep, that embalmed her spirit for a season with blessed
                  forgetfulness. When she awoke from that strange slumber, a soft rain was falling.
                  She heard, as in a dream, the waters below singing their lulling music. She
                  thought herself dying then.</p>
               <p>"The cold waves of Jordan are rolling," she murmured to herself. "The gates of the
                  Beautiful City will soon be in sight."</p>
               <p>A chill shudder shook her frame.</p>
               <p>"The way is dim, and I am cold; shall I never reach my mother? never, never, never
                  find the road? How far to Heaven?"</p>
               <p>"It's a long, long way off yet for you, Mag, I hope. You'll get your feet bruised
                  and torn, if you travel there this road and in such harum-scarum fashion."</p>
               <p>It was Frank's mischievous voice that answered. She recognized the kindness under
                  the piquancy. And again, he lifted her in his strong arms, as he did when a year
                  before she had fallen upon the rocks. She looked up and smiled.</p>
               <p>"I thought the angels had come for me, Frank."</p>
               <p>"You made a splendid blunder at that guess, Mag. Instead of an angel, grandma
                  considers me as one of Nick's own imps. But I intend to <emph>minister</emph> to
                  you this time, puss. Now tell me what you mean by tearing over the rocks like a
                  wild cat, on Sunday? Shall I take a switch to reform your Sunday ways?"</p>
               <p>"There'll be no necessity of that, Frank; Uncle Alph has done it already. Look!"
                  And she held up the bleeding hand.</p>
               <p>"The deuce, he has!" Frank's eyes flashed indignation. "The d——l,
                     <emph>a'most!</emph> Though I won't <emph>swear</emph>".</p>
               <p>"Hush! Frank, hush!"</p>
               <p>Frank bit his lips. She lifted the long drooping lashes from her cheeks, and
                  looked into his eyes, pleadingly. She was still faint. The pleading look brought a
                  gush into his heart which he swallowed with difficulty.</p>
               <p>"Frank, please <emph>love</emph> me a little, for I'm sick now. I'm
                     <emph>dying</emph> to have somebody love me."</p>
               <p>Frank kissed the pale, trembling lips.</p>
               <p>"I thought the angels had come to take me to my mother, and I was <emph>so</emph>
                  disappointed to wake up here."</p>
               <p>"I <emph>do love you,</emph> little fire-bird! I'll prove it, too, when I'm a man,
                  see if I don't! I'll thrash Uncle Alph within an inch of his life. I've always
                     <emph>intended</emph> to do it for you, on account of all his abominations; I
                     <emph>know</emph> I'll do it now."</p>
               <p>"Hush! Frank, please hush! that don't make me happy; I'm sorrier for Uncle Alph
                  than for anybody on earth. He keeps himself perfectly miserable by giving himself
                  up to the evil spirit in him. I can imagine what it is that keeps eternity
                  miserable—spirits are given up entirely to bad passions."</p>
               <p>"But he has no business, Mag, to do the devil's work here. Let him wait till he
                  gets to his own place. Moreover, I've the faith to believe, that a right good
                     thrashing<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6426-00000030"/> now, would develop the
                  angelic in him wonderfully; so, you see it would be a mercy to <emph>him,</emph>
                  Mag, to have it well done. He was badly brought up from the beginning. His mother
                     <emph>spared the rod</emph> on him, and that was what spoilt the child. A
                  spoilt child makes a spoilt man. Somebody said somewhere once, 'The child is the
                  father to the man.' But you'll catch your death out in this rain! Let's see if you
                  can stand on your feet."</p>
               <p>Frank helped her climb up to her feet.</p>
               <p>"How did you come here, Frank?"</p>
               <p>"On my feet, Mag. Did you run away with the idea that I was an angel and came on
                  wings?"</p>
               <p>"I'm afraid you're talking wickedly, Frank."</p>
               <p>"I've no doubt but I am, Miss Propriety, at least, all the over-pious saints, like
                  Grandma Barclay, would say so."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Frank, please don't, now."</p>
               <p>"Well, Mag, I saw you rushing along, tearing like mad over the rocks, so I thought
                  I'd come tearing after you."</p>
               <p>"Oh—oo! Frank."</p>
               <p>"Just so! I know it, Mag. I wanted to be your companion, and here I am."</p>
               <p>"Oh, <emph>dear Frank!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Dear Frank!</emph> Why, how mighty affectionate you are, Mag! But I think I
                  deserve a boon for my disinterestedness."</p>
               <p>"You shall have a <emph>diamond</emph> button when I'm queen; I'll give it to
                  you."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, <emph>ma'am!</emph> I'm much obliged to you! As is the
                     <emph>intention</emph> so is the <emph>guilt.</emph> I'll give you credit for
                  the guilt—take the <emph>will</emph> for the deed. But what's to be done with you
                  now? You can't stay out in this rain, and the squirrels ain't fixed for
                  housekeeping yet."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Frank! What will become of me—whom have I to love, or to whom can I look for
                  that affection which, to a bruised heart, is the one thing needful—I
                     <emph>can't</emph> love uncle nor aunt."</p>
               <p>"I know all that, Mag. I shall deliver you up to Grandma Walton. I'll see you safe
                  through this scrape certain. There'll be the Old Harry to pay—father may pay him,
                  though, now that I think of it, Uncle Alph will be docile by this time, heartily
                  ashamed of himself, and as quiet as a lamb."</p>
               <p>"You can't think how queer my head feels, Frank." She was reeling.</p>
               <p>"It's a queer head, Mag; I'll doctor it for you; I'm going to be a doctor, like my
                  father, anyhow. I'll practise on your case; practice makes perfect, they say. I'll
                  make you perfect by my practice."</p>
               <p>"I am to be number one of your numerous patients."</p>
               <p>"Yes, and lots of patience it will take to reduce you to terms."</p>
               <p>"So Aunt Lina says."</p>
               <p>They walked slowly homeward.</p>
               <p>"Mag, what a pity that Grandpa Barclay couldn't make an exchange for Grandma
                  Walton; I'd go in for the swap worse than forty mules. I'd put in two votes every
                  time." Mag laughed.</p>
               <p>"I shall hold a professional consultation on your case with my father, puss," he
                  said as he left her in grandma's care.</p>

               <head>VI. PROGRESSION.</head>
               <p>FRANK held the promised consultation with his father on Mag's case, the result of
                  which was a professional visit from Dr. Ross, her uncle. The patient was with
                  Grandma Walton. The medicine he administered was any amount of teasing on her
                  racing propensities. He declared he intended to take Frank and Mag to the next
                  State fair, they'd beat the States on a foot-race, but Mag would take the premium.
                  He advised Mag to keep in good practice for the occasion, though he decidedly
                  objected to her practising on Sunday, and decreed that he should forbid Frank's
                  "kiting after girls on Sunday," for all future time.</p>
               <p>All this was said in Dr. Ross' own genial, sunshiny way; he finished his
                  exhortation by telling her that "whenever she was seized with uncontrollable
                  desires to go into the woods and live with squirrels, coons, and such 'varmints,'
                  to let him know it, and he would have a cage fixed for her, up garret in his
                  house, and she, Alec, and Frank might all play 'possum together." Uncle Alph
                  remained in a quiescent state during this visit; Mag was exceedingly polite to
                  him, and abundantly grateful to Uncle Ross, and she promised him that she
                  certainly should come to him, and live with Alec and Frank up garret, when she
                  couldn't think what else to do with herself.</p>
               <p>Mag went on her life-journey with new courage and hope.</p>
               <p>The years went on—she developed in the years. They brought her some stern, sad
                  lessons, on which we will not dwell. It always gives us heartaches to linger on
                  scenes of sadness, and we leave them as soon as possible. The saddest lesson that
                  came was found in the death of Grandma Walton. There is no language to describe
                  Mag's emotion as she stood by her death-bed. The great light and glory of her
                  childhood went away when she looked at her grave, and returned to the desolate
                  cottage, entirely alone. All the <emph>home</emph> charm went away, and was buried
                  in the churchyard.</p>
               <p>Years rolled on—her life-education advanced with the years.</p>
               <p>The regime of Socrates was over in the academy. The disease of romance seized him
                  and carried him off at last. It came late in life with him, but it took him
                  powerfully when it did come.</p>
               <p>One summer day, the report came to all that the master had slipped his bachelor's
                  neck into the sacred noose of matrimony; the deed, moreover, had been done on a
                  Sabbath morning, as he and his "destiny" were walking to church. They met the
                  minister—stopped him under a wide-spreading oak—perhaps they dreamed of sacred <hi
                     rend="i"/>Druidic mysteries to be fathomed; and there the irrevocable knot had
                  been tied. Concerning other preliminaries, the winged fame was silent, but it
                  proclaimed that Romance had woven an original garb from her interminable thread,
                  at last, and it was a nine days' miracle in Glenlyn.</p>
               <p>The news raised a commotion among gossips and children, for report added that the
                  master was about to retire from the halls of the academy, to cultivate the more
                  pleasing pursuits of farming, matrimony, and the muses, and the report was not
                  false.</p>
               <p>Then there followed, "in longo ordine," a succession of occupants for the
                  pedagogue's chair at Glenlyn, like popes for the pontifical chair, at Rome, and
                  under their sway, Mag and Frank grew in wisdom and wit, if not in favor with
                  mankind.</p>
               <p>It must be confessed, Mag was not a favorite in those years; she lived in her sort
                  of way, a free, careless life, when she escaped from Uncle Alph and Aunt Lina;
                     but<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6426-00000032"/> she grew up without one intimate
                  among her schoolmates. Her brown face was not pretty; her ways were not their
                  ways, nor her thoughts their thoughts. Yet it never occurred to her, that there
                  was anything wrong in it all, till one day Aunt Lina, in her own style, gave her a
                  hint like a broadside.</p>
               <p>Mag's sphere of usefulness at home had increased with her years; she had now
                  arrived at the dignity of assistant washerwoman. It was a Monday morning, washing
                  day, and Mag was stationed in the back piazza, her sleeves rolled up, and her
                  elbows ready for the suds. The canaries were singing in the locusts, and she was
                  keeping time to their music, by pounding the clothes with characteristic spirit.
                  Aunt Lina commenced her lesson in the midst of the racket.</p>
               <p>"I never did see one other human being just like you, Mag! I do declare you make
                  me ashamed of you, every day of my life! I watched you at meeting yesterday, all
                  alone, by yourself; neither boy nor girl took any more notice of you than if you'd
                  been a baboon. You haven't a friend in the world; everything you say and do is so
                  odd and queer, that nobody knows what to make of you! Why don't you try to behave
                  like Josie Newton? she is so sweet and pretty! I wish you would take pattern after
                  her. She has <emph>troops</emph> of friends."</p>
               <p>Mag commenced a sort of a charivari around the pounding barrel, to the most
                  thundering music she could extract from the pounder, at mention of Josie Newton as
                  her model.</p>
               <p>"Mag, you little wretch, you'll tear that barrel all to pieces. I believe the Old
                  Harry is in you. You've pounded those clothes enough; don't strip them into inch
                  pieces."</p>
               <p>Mag pitched out the clothes from the boiler, with the broom-stick, wrung them from
                  the suds, put more in boiling, while Aunt Lina went on.</p>
               <p>"I think it's high time you were mending your manners. What do you suppose will
                  ever become of such a little heathen? You'd better try to make yourself
                  friends—you'll need 'em bad enough one of these days. Better have the good will of
                  a dog than the ill will; everybody is snapping and snarling at you for your
                  impudence." That last remark was a <emph>fancy</emph> remark of Aunt Lina's,
                  suggested by the adage of the dog, and she also judged other people's habits of
                  snappishness by her own, which is natural for women to do.</p>
               <p>Mag here again interrupted her remarks, by accomplishing a big blunder, the
                  exploit of pouring the suds over the piazza floor, instead of emptying them into
                  the drain, toward which the barrel was aimed.</p>
               <p>"What on earth are you up to now, Mag?" screamed Aunt Lina.</p>
               <p>"I just thought the floor needed washing, aunty." Mag laughed pleasantly,
                  following the barrel as it rolled over and over. "And rolling the barrel is such
                  good exercise, you know." She succeeded in catching it; placed it on end, then
                  seizing little Harry, who was running by, she tossed him in the air, to set him
                  screaming; then lifted him into the empty barrel, till his shouts of crying and
                  laughter effectually stopped Aunt Lina's tirade, which was what Mag wanted.</p>
               <p>But Mag pondered the lesson—there was <emph>some</emph> truth in it. She laid
                  these things up in her heart for future reference and use.</p>
               <p>She believed she was heathenish enough, in all conscience, and so she concluded
                  she would take the advice, and "mend her manners." Aunt Lina seemed to think it a
                  consummation devoutly to be wished, to have <emph>troops</emph> of friends. Well,
                  she must contrive to beat up some new <emph>recruits</emph>—she must hunt for the
                  weak points in humanity, and try her success in a <emph>siege</emph> of hearts.
                  She had a sort of contempt for the Josie Newtons—the <emph>fractional</emph> souls
                  around her. She and Frank had discussed them all—the <emph>whole</emph> specimens,
                  and the <emph>fragments</emph>—the souls in <emph>tatters;</emph> but it might be
                  well to put them to some use, make them<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6426-00000033"/>
                  serviceable; sometime or other they might be beneficial. As Aunt Lina said, "She
                  might need 'em one of these days." No harm to grow popular in school. She would
                  turn politician—do a little electioneering, for practice.</p>
               <p>After the washing she went to school, and <emph>meditated</emph> on her way. She
                  must "captivate" some friends. Miss Josie might be her first experiment, the path
                  to her affections was so plain. Her weak point, like that of the sex in general,
                  was love of admiration. Alec Ross had any amount of enthusiasm for blue eyes,
                  pouting lips, fairy fingers, exquisite feet and ankles, finely turned neck and
                  shoulders, all the manifold points of the inchoate belle. Mag soon had the two in
                  the full tide of a grand flirtation. The elements of the affaire du cœur were all
                  prepared, it was easy to bring them together, the ingredients combined by chemical
                  affinity, and there followed the ferment and foam of a violent school-boy and
                  school-girl love. Delightful affairs they are, too, as every one will testify who
                  will look back upon his own experience. This disease of first love—or "puppy
                  love," as the irreverential call it—takes one, like the measles, and is really
                  dangerous in some of its phases, but is easily cured when skillfully managed. The
                  only danger is where weak-minded friends and guardians treat it too seriously:
                  they bring on the dangerous crises which they wish to avert, by opposing in dead,
                  solemn earnest, what might be frightened away by a little well-timed ridicule,
                  with an occasional sneer appropriately applied.</p>
               <p>"Love borrows greatly from opinion. Pride, above all things, strengthens the
                  affections." Contempt and ridicule are difficult to swallow, and will cool off the
                  fever of a first love amazingly. Serious opposition makes common fruit
                     <emph>forbidden,</emph> which is acknowledged to be the sweetest fruit in the
                  universe. The most of forbidden fruit is desirable only <emph>because</emph> it is
                  forbidden; if once within the grasp, it palls upon the taste. "The course of true
                  love never runs smooth." The rough road over which love travels gives it
                  truthfulness. <emph>A smooth</emph> road takes away its piquancy and charm, and it
                  dies of inanition. The forbidden fruit, so ardently desired, most frequently
                  becomes a curse when once we clasp it—as much a curse as the fruit of Eden proved
                  to frail, fair Eve. Love, Fame, Gold, Ambition!—beautiful fruits afar off, beyond
                  the grasp. "Distance lends enchantment," but "familiarity breeds contempt" for
                     <emph>all.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>In this category is placed only the love born of passion and fed by the physical
                  nature, not that born of heaven, nursed by the spirit, fed by the intellectual and
                  moral, yet graced by the charms of the physical. The intellectual, moral and
                  physical combined in perfect proportions, form a perfect earthly nature, which is
                  capable of perfect love. But most of humanity have partial natures; an
                  intellectual nature does not comprehend a physical, passionate love in its depth
                  and strength. A purely physical nature has no conception of intellectual and
                  spiritual fascination—the <emph>grace</emph> that perfects love, and brings heaven
                  on earth. Alas! there are creatures made in God's image, endowed only with brute
                  passions, who have no faith in the moral power bestowed upon man. God help them!
                  God protect the defenceless near them! But my pen has wandered.</p>
               <p>Mag took the management of that first love of Alec Ross. She became interested in
                  it, consequently Josie became interested in her, and so she had a <emph>friend
                     (!)</emph> It was worth the trouble—was not a losing speculation.</p>
               <p>Mag learned by it to sympathize with every pair of lovers she met. She studied to
                  make herself <emph>useful</emph> to them—took upon herself an art she learned of
                  the heathen, to fulfill the duties of Eros and Anteros—insinuated herself by
                  degrees into the graces of both "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">beau</foreign>" and
                     "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">belle</foreign>-monde," and soon was rewarded by being
                  herself <emph>appreciated;</emph> and she, too, as well as Josie Newton, had
                  troops of friends.</p>
               <p>There was Nell Brandon, the school poetess, who was fond of moonshine and mystery
                  and romance. Mag became<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6426-00000034"/> afflicted with
                  the same tastes. Both caught the Byronic fever. The first stages were burning
                  fiercely in the strongest symptoms, as they strolled over mountain and valley, at
                  morn and dewy eve, reciting, in eloquence, kindled to sweet frenzy: <q>

                        <l rend="ti-4">"Oh, night,</l>
                        <l>And storm, and darkness! ye are wond'rous strong,</l>
                        <l>Yet lovely in your strength as is the light</l>
                        <l>Of a <emph>dark eye in woman!</emph>"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> And when the two had Frank Ross to stir up the inspired fire, the charm was
                  complete.</p>
               <p>Mag found one <emph>friend</emph>—one <emph>whole</emph> soul, and not a
                     <emph>fragment.</emph> When she was at the ripening age of sixteen, a whole
                  soul, at that time a child of twelve crossed the orbit of Mag's existence, and
                  called out the best emotions of her nature. Of May Burton, more anon.</p>
               <p>As we have said, Mag grew excessively romantic. A school-girl just fledging is the
                  most intolerably romantic of all mortal flesh—most unendurably poetic and pedantic
                  of all breathing things, unless, indeed, it be a college boy.</p>
               <p>Never does humanity have such perfect admiration of its own powers, such unbounded
                  confidence in the might and glory of its own capacities, as when it stands on the
                  threshold of young manhood, taking its first outlook, preparing for the first rush
                  into the battle of life. It marches forth proudly, treading time to clarion music.
                  And if it can laugh at defeat, and rise with new courage, and dare and do all
                  things valiantly for the truth till the end, that end will be victory, for there
                  is a God who battles for the true and brave!</p>
               <p>Mag grew alarmingly sentimental with Nell Brandon. Frank told her that they were
                  completely saturated with poetry, and drenched a poor fellow every time he came
                  near. He was in hopes some of it would evaporate. A deal of nonsense would have to
                  be taken out of her yet; but take courage—he had hopes of her.</p>
               <p>Mag returned the compliment. At this time Frank and Alec were in Yale College.
                  Frank boiling over with sophomoric spirit, highly satisfied with his progress in
                  world knowledge, his personal dignity under full sail, and at times with a swell
                  of canvas a little larger than he could well carry. He was immensely confident of
                  his success in the management of human nature, feminine nature especially. He had
                  a sort of impression that the whole world was a garden of Hesperides, blooming in
                  luxuriance, from which he was to gather golden apples to beguile Atalantas by
                  their frail points, and prevent their winning in the race and contest of life.</p>
               <p>Mag grew so very romantic that she professed herself <emph>proud</emph> of her
                  humility, inconsistency and indiscretion. Her teacher for the winter—a student
                  from Williams College—became a great admirer of those virtuous attractions.</p>
               <p>Frank was at home for the short winter vacation. A large party of academicians,
                  including Mr. Young, the teacher, had been employing the noon recesses in building
                  a snow-fort from a fine drift under the hillside, by the frozen brook. On a grand
                  moonlight night the party went out skating on the ice, and Frank found it an
                  occasion to bring all his powers into play, all his tactics and diplomacy to
                  manage affairs to his satisfaction. He felt in the mood of freeing his mind to
                  Mag, that night, on college experiences; wanted to pour out the accumulation of
                  world philosophy that was oppressing him; but circumstances were not favorable.
                  Mr. Young was playing "sweet" to Mag, so that she was unapproachable, and worse
                  than all, Jose Newton was desperately attentive to Frank himself. He grew cross
                  over it all.</p>
               <p>"I say, Mag, can't you contrive to call them off?" he whispered to her in an
                  energetic aside. "The deuce is in it, if I don't make Alec take charge of his own
                  sweetheart. She's too dulcet for me. I am not fond of that sort of sugar-plums.
                  They always acted on me like emetics. Mag, do call them off!"</p>
               <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6426-00000035"/>
               <p>Mag laughed. "Couldn't, possibly, Frank! It's past my genius!"</p>
               <p>Frank fretted and chafed. Men should control circumstances; not be under their
                  control. These circumstances must be put into shape.</p>
               <p>"When there's a will there's a way," said he to Mag, "and I'll find the way or
                  shoot myself!"</p>
               <p>"Don't, Frank!" said Mag. "What could we do with a shot sophomore!"</p>
               <p>"Do you put on your skates for a race while I attend to Sweetness."</p>
               <p>He turned and invited Josie to visit the snow-fort. She went, entertaining him by
                  the way with her most elaborate graces.</p>
               <p>"The winds are saucy to night, Josie," said he. "They've kissed your lips and
                  cheeks so daringly, they've called out all the beauty! And the moonshine is pale
                  by your blushes! You must shield yourself from such arrogance." He lifted the pine
                  branches from the entrance of the fort. Josie giggled and entered. He bowed and
                  touched his hat to her, and Josie simpered and blushed.</p>
               <p>"The palace of Josephine, queen of hearts!"</p>
               <p>"You are a great flatterer, Mr. Frank," said Josie with gratified vanity.</p>
               <p>"I <emph>crown</emph> you Queen of Beauty!" he went on, pulling an evergreen from
                  the door of the fort. He twisted it in a grotesque fashion around her golden
                  curls, contriving to get the curls and crown both into her eyes.</p>
               <p>"I beg your pardon! Your charms unnerve and bewilder me, Queen of Beauty—Empress
                  of Hearts!"</p>
               <p>"I am a queen without subjects, Mr. Frank."</p>
               <p>"Your subjects shall pay their liege-lady homage here. Your throne is here." And
                  Frank put his hand in the region of his liver, and seated her on a cool,
                  snow-cushioned sofa in the fort; then bowed himself out, contriving to drop the
                  evergreen boughs before the door, so as to leave Josie a prisoner in the
                  palace.</p>
               <p>"What shall be the fate of the queen, whose delight it is to break the hearts of
                  the subjects who adore her?" he asked?</p>
               <p>"She will throw herself upon their mercy."</p>
               <p>"Imitating her example, they will have no mercy. My brother Alec, the Ross, is
                  gnawing his heart away for the queen who has trampled upon it. I will deliver you
                  up to his loving kindness, which is most fierce. I see death looking from his
                  eye—whether it is murder for me, or suicide—it must be prevented. To his mercy I
                  will deliver you. He will measure it by your mercy to him."</p>
               <p>And after this malicious nonsense, Frank left her to dispose of her emotions as
                  best she might, while he proceeded toward Mag, who was fastening her skates—the
                  master by her side.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Young, a lady wishes to see you in the fort yonder. You have an opportunity
                  of proving your devotion to the fair. Most enviable of mortals, to be called on to
                  succor beauty in distress. The lady has a particular mission for you to
                  accomplish."</p>
               <p>"But it is against my principles to resign a present known good for one that is
                  future and uncertain."</p>
               <p>"I believe this case is not optional; there is an urgent necessity requiring your
                  attendance. You'll be obliged to go! I congratulate you, faithful knight. It is
                  your privilege to aid a distressed damsel."</p>
               <p>Mr. Young very unwillingly departed.</p>
               <p>"Now, Mag, for a race!" he said, cheerily, as he tried the fastenings of his
                  skates.</p>
               <p>"But, Frank, what does all your impudence mean?" she asked, as they skated off
                  with a deliberate motion, like birds getting under the sweep of wings. "Haven't
                  you such an article as a conscience in your possession?"</p>
               <p>"Consciences are of no use, Mag, in polite society—are entirely out of date—the
                  fashion passed long ago."</p>
               <p>"You have but little reverence for anything human or feminine."</p>
               <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6426-00000036"/>
               <p>"Oh, a fellow learns to think that neither mankind nor womankind deserve it." They
                  passed his brother in skating. "Hillo, Alec! Your sweet-heart to the rescue! She
                  is in durance <emph>vile;</emph> she desires your prayers, that said durance may
                  be as little <emph>vile</emph> as possible!" He added to Mag: "I say, that remark
                  of mine came so near being a witticism it almost choked me. It just missed being a
                  pun."</p>
               <p>"Shall I send for a physician? Think there is any danger?"</p>
               <p>"I shall survive, Mag. If smartness could have killed me, I should have been under
                  ground long ago. As I was saying; wasn't I?"</p>
               <p>"I believe you were, Frank."</p>
               <p>"Evil and good are so confoundedly tangled in humanity, that one learns to be
                  unscrupulous in the use of both; taking all possible advantage without trying to
                  untwist or disentangle either."</p>
               <p>Mag made no reply to this profound proposition.</p>
               <p>"It's a grand world after all, Mag."</p>
               <p>"I always <emph>said</emph> so, Frank."</p>
               <p>"Look at that moon—look at those stars—look at the diamond sparkles over the
                  silver snow-hills, and you'll <emph>swear</emph> it."</p>
               <p>"I declare I won't, Frank."</p>
               <p>"And here is an individual who intends to enjoy this same old earth."</p>
               <p>"You'll have some hard work to do in it, Frank."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I'll do the work—hard work too, Mag; sledgehammer brain work. I've done some
                  tall thinking already; am not afraid of intellectual labor. But I'll have some
                  sport—rare sport—see if I don't! By the by, Mag, what little Hindoo were you
                  patronizing a few minutes ago—that thing standing like a kitten yonder. I intend
                  to fall in love with her. What a morsel she is, anyhow."</p>
               <p>"That thing is my most very particular friend. Come and I'll introduce you." They
                  whirled up to a little brunette lady, and Mag introduced,</p>
               <p>"My cousin, Frank Ross, Miss May Burton."</p>
               <p>Frank bestowed his most elegant salutation.</p>
               <p>"You are looking quite solitary, Miss May," he said with an effort to be agreeable
                  and patronizing. "We would like your company on a sailing excursion. Mag and
                  myself are circulating media to-night. We'll give you a grand slide."</p>
               <p>The figure looked dubious.</p>
               <p>"Please come with us, May," said Mag. "You'll not be afraid with me."</p>
               <p>Frank and Mag took each a hand of the child, and they flew over the ice.</p>
               <p>"May is a cousin of Ralph Burton's," said Mag.</p>
               <p>"Then Miss May and I ought to be friends, don't you think so, Ralph being a great
                  friend of mine?"</p>
               <p>"If we both behave properly, we may possibly be friends," the lady in miniature
                  answered.</p>
               <p>"It's a gone case with me, Mag," Frank whispered; "I can see with half an eye what
                  I am coming to."</p>
               <p>"Can you give me any rules for proper behavior? I shall be anxious to behave well
                  in future, to win you for my little friend."</p>
               <p>"My rules can't suit you, sir. The first one mother gave me, that little girls
                  should be seen and not heard. You don't chance to be a little girl."</p>
               <p>"No, it's a great pity! Little girls are so much prettier than boys. No doubt my
                  mother wishes I was a girl; but it's too late now—it can't be helped. I have an
                  impression, though, that I've always had a little girl friend like you. Haven't
                  you and I known each other before, sometime? In another life, perhaps. Don't you
                  remember it? You came to me, I think, like a good spirit, in a gush of sunshine
                  one summer day. Don't you travel often with the sunbeams?"</p>
               <p>"I don't remember it, sir; and if you saw my face you wouldn't ask. Mother calls
                  me her <emph>cloud</emph>—her <emph>shadow;</emph> I can't play sunshine, for my
                  face is all <emph>dark</emph>ness."</p>
               <p>"You have gipsy blood. I knew there was some witchery<pb n="72-73"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000037"/> ery in you. You were the little bird that came and
                  sung to me under my window last spring."</p>
               <p>"No, sir; I never sing."</p>
               <p>"What a pity! But I'm sure we've been friends a long time. The winds come to me
                  every day, and tell me such wild, funny stories; and at midnight they whisper the
                  strangest, sweetest nonsense. You come with them sometimes, do you not?"</p>
               <p>"Never. I'm fast asleep by midnight; and I never whisper in company, or tell
                  stories, or talk nonsense to nice gentlemen."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you did it in your dreams."</p>
               <p>"I am sure I did not. It was not <emph>me.</emph> I did nothing so very foolish,
                  even in my dreams."</p>
               <p>"Some good fairy comes and lays her tiny hand on mine when I am about to do wrong,
                  and tells me to stop. Are you not that good little fairy?"</p>
               <p>"If I came, it was a <emph>brownie,</emph> not a <emph>fairy;</emph> and I did not
                     <emph>stay long,</emph> for I do not remember it, or you."</p>
               <p>"No, not long, or I should have caught and kept you."</p>
               <p>"And that would have been wicked. I should have cried, till you had been glad to
                  open the door for me and bid me be-gone home to my mother; you had no use for
                  crying things."</p>
               <p>"I'm completely annihilated," said Frank, sotto voce, to Mag.</p>
               <p>They skated round the pond, gossiping talk like moonshine, till May said she must
                  find her cousin Ralph and go home.</p>
               <p>"You are getting cold, I see, and ought to go home; but Ralph is engaged with Miss
                  Josie Newton, and cannot be spared. Mag and I will see you safe home."</p>
               <p>"But," said Mag, "Mr. Young engaged to show me some sums in Davies' Bourdon
                  to-night."</p>
               <p>"Let Mr. Young go to grass!" ejaculated Mr. Frank.</p>
               <p>"Would you advise him to go <emph>now,</emph> or wait till spring?"</p>
               <p>"He may teach you algebra when I've no use for you. You are going with us now."
                  And Mag went.</p>
               <p>Mr. Young went home with her afterward, to explain <emph>mathematics.</emph>
                  Having seated himself, he first opened a copy of Zanoni, and discussed it; next
                  dissected Rienzi—then took a volume of Burns from his pocket, accompanied by
                  Wordsworth; then a number of Noctes Ambrosianæ opening to Hogg's transmigration as
                  an African lion, they theorized over the transmigration of souls in general. They
                  skimmed the Waverley poems and romances, with Chivalry and Don Quixote; turned the
                  pages of Carlyle, Emerson, Kingsley, Eclipse of Faith, Lola Montez, and Tennyson's
                  Princess; reading the marked passages on the woman question, with remarks on the
                  woman poet, Browning, in her sphere, and Lola, a star out of orbit; winding up all
                  with, <q>
                     <l>"Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>They illustrated this line, by forgetting all other lines, angles and problems in
                  mathematics, to lay a wager who would soonest learn and recite "The Grave," from
                  Montgomery.</p>
               <p>They studied fifteen minutes in silence, save the tick of the watch.</p>
               <p>"Done!" said Mag, "I know the whole of it."</p>
               <p>"Done!" echoed the master; "I know every word. But it is late, and I suppose I
                  must tear myself away; so good night."</p>
               <p>He took his hat, and stood at the door.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Young—please give me the work to those sums on the 166th page of the Bourdon,
                  or I shall fail in recitation to-morrow."</p>
               <p>Mr. Young looked confused, and sat down to an unpalatable dish of mathematics. It
                  would not combine with the poetry and moonshine that had preceded, and had been
                  unsettling his wits. The more he puzzled over the problems, the more they would
                  not be solved, and at last he was obliged to tell Mag he'd bring her the work in
                  the morning,<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6426-00000038"/> or excuse her for failing,
                  if his senses were lost beyond the reach of mathematics.</p>
               <p>It <emph>is</emph> bewildering business for a teacher to read marked passages in
                  the poets, to a pair of brown eyes with long-fringed lashes, that droop sometimes
                  upon the cheek, or lift themselves with a shy glance, like a young fawn; it
                     <emph>is</emph> deleterious business to mathematics.</p>
               <p>But the next morning Josie made her appearance with a most woe-begone phiz. Both
                  Mag and the master forgot the algebra to sympathize with her. It was affecting—the
                  blue eyes swollen with tears, which continued their grievous flow. She electrified
                  the school—threw the gloom of her countenance over all, by sitting at her desk the
                  whole of the livelong day, weeping, and flooding sheets of foolscap with
                  sentiment, which she bestowed upon Mag. She bewailed the unfortunate fate of
                  possessing affections to be wounded by those she loved, feelings to be shattered
                  by those who loved her no longer, and a heart so soft and tender that ruthless
                  humanity could make it their sport, piercing and tearing it with a thousand
                  cureless wounds.</p>
               <p>For three days Josie continued these intermittent exercises, alternately weeping
                  and writing, claiming all Mag's compassion, till the master and school began to
                  think it no parable, the "fountain of tears weeping day and night." At last Mag
                  could endure it no longer; she went to Frank.</p>
               <p>"For mercy's sake, Frank, do go and comfort that lady of the rueful countenance.
                  You've certainly damaged her heart. She is spoiling all her beauty—pining herself
                  into a <emph>green,</emph> if not yellow melancholy. It will be charity to her and
                  the public to console her. She is throwing herself and the school into
                  spasms."</p>
               <p>Frank shrugged his shoulders, made a series of wry faces, and at last did as he
                  was bid; bestirred himself for Josie.</p>
               <p>The school examinations came off. Mag distinguished herself in the classics and
                  belles-lettres; also by writing a play from the Bible, which was performed on the
                  stage with much success; it brought down the house.</p>
               <p>Frank went into equal ecstasies over May Burton's brown face and curls, her gem of
                  an essay on Sympathy, black silk frock, and the graceful pantalette that fringed
                  her tiny gaiters. He declared he "loved her forty gals already, and it
                     <emph>grew</emph> a gal every day; he was gone past redemption."</p>
               <p>And the result of this <emph>growing</emph> love was, that in Frank's summer
                  vacation there was formed a miraculous bond of cousinship, in the shape of a
                  "secret society" of four—Mag and Frank, May and her cousin Ralph—which society had
                  for its professed object the promotion of goodness—not among the heathen of
                  distant lands, but among its own members. They pirated as its motto, at Frank's
                  suggestion, the far-famed mystic Φ Β. Κ., which he translated, <foreign
                     xml:lang="GRC">φιλοσοφια Βιου Κακια</foreign>—Philosophy, the Torment of Life.
                  So anxious were the quartette for the promotion of goodness that they made
                  interesting excursions together among the mountains; pic-nics at Glenlyn Falls;
                  fishing parties on the lake hidden in the heart of the hills. Frank's college
                  comrades were invited often to these excursions; they grew popular among the
                  students; but on these occasions the society doffed the badge of secrecy, and
                  became a public one, where the village belles, Josie Newton and Nell Brandon,
                  displayed their glories.</p>
               <p>The secret society held its choicest meetings in Dr. Ross' rockaway; it just
                  seated the quaternity. One moonlight ride was remembered by them all till the
                  last, for a covenant, lightly made by all, but strangely kept years afterward.</p>
               <p>"You have a fault, Mag, that is growing upon you," said Ralph Burton, as the
                  horses were wandering at their own sweet will,—Frank being in a flight of
                  balderdash, which was settling down upon May Burton with such effect, the reins of
                  government had slipped from his hands.</p>
               <p>"Only one fault at last! I must be getting into a hopeful condition. What will
                  Aunt Lina say?" answered Mag.</p>
               <p>"Don't flatter yourself you've reached the last one,<pb n="76-77"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000039"/> Ralph; you've only caught the advance-guard;
                  there's an army coming behind. It will be labor thrown away trying to overcome
                  them. I speak from the experience of a lifetime," said Frank.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps the fault was in your mode of correction. The teacher may have been in
                  the wrong," said May.</p>
               <p>"Impossible!" ejaculated Frank.</p>
               <p>"But my one fault now?" asked Mag.</p>
               <p>"Coquetry!" Ralph responded.</p>
               <p>"You've discovered it! Yes, Mag is an old sinner. I'll swear to that. She
                  extinguished the master last winter. He was a sparkling youth, but with her the
                  glow and shine waxed dim and dimmer, till the spark vanished in the distance. He
                  taught her to sing, 'Maiden, behold <emph>me!</emph>' Gave her lessons in poetry
                  and puns. In return, she taught him to skate, snow-ball, slide down hill; yet made
                  it an 'all slide off' at last, poor fellow."</p>
               <p>"That was a desperate effort at witticism, Frank," said Mag. "Don't you feel
                  exhausted after it? You will, no doubt, win immortality yet by some astonishing
                  tale of <emph>fiction.</emph> It will be so easy for you to draw on your
                  imagination for facts. All in habit."</p>
               <p>"It is moved that Frank's faults be laid before the Society."</p>
               <p>"Laid under the table," suggested Frank.</p>
               <p>"The motion is unanimously seconded," replied May. "He is accused of being wiser
                  in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason."</p>
               <p>"And a deal wiser in the estimation of others than in his own estimation," added
                  Frank.</p>
               <p>His case did require peculiar consideration; being, as he said, an uncommonly
                  influential member of community, it was necessary that his morals should be
                  strictly attended to. He promised that he would study unusual morals, and find the
                  best moral to every incident in life.</p>
               <p>Mag insisted that his were growing crooked, and would result in certain
                  catastrophe; a warning to all. Frank said he would prevent all terrible disasters
                  by putting his morals into May's care and training—a responsibility which she
                  respectfully begged leave to decline.</p>
               <p>"To-day is my seventeenth birthday!" exclaimed Mag, changing the subject abruptly.
                  "Where will this night two years find us?"</p>
               <p>"Rovers and pilgrims on the brave old earth," said Frank, "battling with Fate, if
                  she has the audacity to oppose us, and putting our feet upon her neck, if she
                     <emph>dare</emph> play us false."</p>
               <p>Frank's tone rung out with such arrogant energy that little, pure minded May
                  Burton was startled.</p>
               <p>"Amen!" added Ralph.</p>
               <p>And Mag remembered the steel glow that shot in Ralph's blue eye, and the smile
                  that closed firmly around the well cut lips as he pronounced the word.</p>
               <p>"Whatever fate has in store for us, this night two years we four will meet again,"
                  Mag said, earnestly.</p>
               <p>They all repeated together the solemn covenant.</p>
               <p>"<emph>If it be possible,</emph> we four will meet again two years from this
                  night, Magdalene Barclay's birth-night anniversary!"</p>
               <p>The promise was not forgotten.</p>

               <head>VII. COUSIN MIN.</head>
               <p>"I HAVE some good news for you, Frank," said Mag, one day, as he made his
                  appearance at Uncle Alph's.</p>
               <p>Mag was up to her elbows in flour, making biscuits for tea.</p>
               <p>"Make it music to mine ears, by utterance," responded Frank, with his usual
                  imperturbable face, as he proceeded to fasten her sleeves back on each shoulder
                  with a pin, to keep them from the flour, in which they were whitening.</p>
               <p>"Bad business arrangement, Mag. You have caught some of Uncle Alph's habits of
                  planning. Your <emph>fore</emph>thought has happened along <emph>after</emph>ward,
                  this time. Next time be sure to put your apron on, and pin up your sleeves, before
                  you pitch in the flour."</p>
               <p>"I declare, I intend to do it, Frank. Now walk into the parlor, and I'll introduce
                  you."</p>
               <p>Mag took her hands out of the flour, held them up out of the way of her dress, in
                  front of her shoulders, escorted him to the parlor, and with a grand flourish
                  presented him to a rare specimen of humanity—a girl of fifteen, with a complexion
                  so exquisitely fresh, that her face was radiant with fair bloom.</p>
               <p>"Cousin Min Walton, I have the honor of presenting for your distinguished
                  consideration, <emph>our</emph> cousin Frank Ross, A.B., M.D., LL.D., etc., all in
                  prospectu."</p>
               <p>Frank bowed, without in the slightest degree discomposing his equanimity, for her
                  "distinguished consideration"—took a sweeping glance at the tout ensemble of her
                  cousinship ship, which glance was, in the highest sense of the term,
                  satisfactory.</p>
               <p>"Mag has beguiled me here under the promise of <emph>good news.</emph> If this is
                  the article referred to, I must confess myself under exceeding obligations."</p>
               <p>Frank's tones were as winning and deferential as his eyes were mischievous. His
                  bow and smile were the most elaborate and captivating that he could compose for
                  the occasion.</p>
               <p>"Thank you," responded the lady with a blush that drew sparkles from her black
                  eyes; "I'm only afraid the article is not good as it is new."</p>
               <p>Min was to be Mag's room-mate and class-mate at the next session of the academy.
                  She proved to be a newly discovered treasure; the handsomest, merriest, most
                  unspoilable witch in all Christendom. In many things, she was Mag's opposite. She
                  had a perfectly healthful, buoyant spirit—a spirit that never became morbid, that
                  rejected and repelled disease, and had no sympathy for anything in the form of
                  sickly sentiment. Her nature seemed born of light and sunshine; had a powerful
                  affinity for joy and happiness, sought it continually, and found it in all manner
                  of accordant and discordant elements. When by mischance she was forced to shed
                  tears, she was the first to laugh at her own sorrow; yet she had pure, rich
                  sympathies, that Mag tested in many a way.</p>
               <p>"It is charming to have a full-grown cousin born suddenly and unxepectedly into
                  one's world," remarked Frank.</p>
               <p>"And how delightful to stumble suddenly into a new world, inhabited by cousins of
                  all sorts, sizes, and descriptions, with not one of whom one is acquainted, though
                  anxious to love all," Min responded cordially.</p>
               <p>"Frank and I will do ourselves the pleasure of introducing you to all the lions
                  and lionesses of Glenlyn," said Mag. "Frank will prepare your mind, while I am
                  getting tea."</p>
               <p>After tea they both undertook to enlighten the lady, as to the character and
                  habits of the people among whom she<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6426-00000041"/> had
                  fallen, coming at last to Grandma Barclay, "a subject on which my imagination
                  always <emph>soars,</emph>" said Frank.</p>
               <p>"We shall take an interest in its <emph>flight,</emph> so you may take a pair of
                  its longest wings," replied Min.</p>
               <p>"He will borrow <emph>fancy's pinions,</emph> he scorns <emph>fact,</emph> when he
                  dilates on Grandma Barclay's perfections," said Mag.</p>
               <p>"Fancy could never reach the top of grandma's virtues; <emph>fact</emph> alone can
                  do her justice, as you will see, when you know her. Mag must come and introduce
                  you to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"You must give me a description to-day, then, so that I may regulate my
                  behavior."</p>
               <p>Frank cleared his throat very expressively.</p>
               <p>"Grandma Barclay is a woman fond of authority. It has been a lifelong grief to
                  her, that she was not born a commodore or general, and she has employed her
                  lifetime in the utmost endeavor to remedy that mistake of destiny at her birth,
                  and has assumed the right to wear the distinctive habiliments of man! She has a
                  general oversight of everybody's business—that is to say, keeps her eyes on
                  everybody's pigs and cows; orders everybody's boys and girls, marches them to
                  school on week days and rectifies their morals on Sundays."</p>
               <p>"She has had the especial charge of Frank's morals and manners, hence their
                  present state of unusual perfection," said Mag.</p>
               <p>"No wonder that Alec and myself are pattern men. She regulates us to this day,
                  from the time we wash our faces in the morning, till she tucks us into bed at
                  night, when she makes us say our prayers, under penalty of a whipping here, and a
                  hot bed hereafter; all of which may be fun to you, but is worse than the fate of
                  the frogs to us."</p>
               <p>Min was trying to choke down a tempest of fun into seriousness.</p>
               <p>"She has developed us according to her own discretion; expanded our organs of
                  reverence for her, by popping corn for us, of a winter's evening, and seasoning
                  them with ghost and witch stories, which gave us unbounded veneration, besides
                  alarming dreams; notwithstanding she warmed the bed for our slumbers with the very
                  warming-pan in which she popped the corn. Also she has been always fruitful of
                  inventions by which she could manifest her interest and affection for us. She
                  grows fond of herbs and flowers that we may have an opportunity of cultivating
                  industry by digging the pretties. She is interested in our health; doses us with
                  pennyroyal, boneset, sage, and hoarhound teas, saying nothing of the love that
                  comes to us with wormwood and gall, pills and powders, which she administers with
                  the rod and quotations from Solomon."</p>
               <p>"Which are richly merited, without a chance of doubting."</p>
               <p>"Economy is one of her prime virtues. She has miraculous 'saving' propensities.
                  She is anxious to save souls; she has an equal anxiety for saving old dresses,
                  bonnets, old hats, breeches, waistcoats, armies of old boots, shoes, stockings,
                  piles of old rags, books and newspapers. She has herself an excessive veneration
                  for all things in print, and considers it a mortal sin to waste the most
                  infinitesimal scrap—has used the same fold of paper for a year to carry her dinner
                  to church on Sundays. If she catches us tearing a newspaper, she comes down upon
                  us with the rod, or throws up her two hands and eyelids toward heaven with an
                  expression of holy horror very affecting to behold."</p>
               <p>"Rest awhile, Frank!" said Mag, imploringly.</p>
               <p>"Tender-hearted past all belief, is Grandma Barclay to men and mice. Not only to
                  us, but to all afflicted mortality, does she show her loving kindness. At all
                  times of the year is her room ornamented with broken baskets, containing chickens,
                  ducks, turkeys, and geese with broken wings and legs. In winter she fills the
                  corners, cracks and crannies of her big fireplace with half frozen lambs, rolled
                  up in old aprons, whose bleating to her is music beyond that of heavenly spheres.
                  The supper of these lambs is prepared<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6426-00000042"/>
                  pared and taken in a defunct teapot. Time would fail to mention the families of
                  calves and colts that she has educated; the races of rats and mice that she has
                  matronized, when thrown from their tender nests in the granaries, out upon the
                  cold charities of the pitiless world. New homes she builds for these, out of
                  dilapidated boots and shoes, where she trains them up to unnatural habits of
                  luxury."</p>
               <p>"You'll do the subject better justice if you'll take breath, Frank," said Mag,
                  offering him a fan.</p>
               <p>"Don't stop me suddenly, Mag. It will be dangerous. I must wind off by degrees or
                  damage myself."</p>
               <p>"Wonderfully pious she is—a great terror to evil-doers. She has a passion for
                  proving to them that the way of transgressors is hard. A model of
                     <emph>piety</emph> she is, and <emph>impartial</emph> love. To prove her pious
                  spirit, she gave Alec a Bible to make him good—pity it hadn't done it; afterwards
                  when she saw some other copies, done up in superior style, at costly prices, it
                  occurred to her that I too might be benefited by the book—so she purchased. She
                  found herself in a quandary—anxious to manifest her <emph>impartial</emph> love.
                  To prove that her love for me was equal in <emph>price</emph> to her love for
                  Alec, she bought of him the Bible she had already presented him, paying
                     <emph>him</emph> the price paid for Bible number two; then presented me with
                  the first purchase, and bestowed on him the second edition! We never could doubt,
                  after that proof, that the expense of her love for me was equal in impartiality to
                  her love for Alec. Of her other virtues"——</p>
               <p>"Yonder comes May Burton," interrupted Mag. And Frank abruptly changed the subject
                  and tone of his remarks.</p>
               <p>"A shadow approaches," he whispered to Min, as if his mind was burdened with a
                  tremendous secret. "As Byron exclaimed, 'Behold me gathered in a cloud!' Behold me
                  in visions of <emph>darkness</emph> more bewitching than sunshine—my affections in
                  an awful fix. I've a secret to tell you, Cousin Min. I'm devotedly in love
                  with"——</p>
               <p>"May Burton, our cousin, Min Walton," said Mag.</p>
               <p>"Precisely! The <emph>first</emph> mentioned especially. Providential
                  interposition, to spare <emph>my</emph> modesty and blushes, the mention of the
                  name." This was sotto voce to Min.</p>
               <p>"A good evening to bonny, <emph>wee</emph> cousin May," he said, offering her his
                  hand, with his sunniest smile and kindliest glance. He had a smile and glance of
                  peculiar meaning that he reserved for especial friends and occasions—a wealth of
                  light in it. He lavished both in wanton prodigality on the little girl, to make
                  her love him; and why?</p>
               <p>"Was ever another mortal so fortunate!" he went on. "Cousin to <emph>three</emph>
                  graces! <emph>three</emph> muses! One belle!" nodding expressly to Min, "one
                     <emph>poetess,</emph>" with an inclination to Mag, "and one
                     <emph>genius,</emph>" with a reverential bow to May.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Nine</emph> of us! all of the female persuasion!" said May.</p>
               <p>"Ah, May! If your genius, in its earliest springtime, during the germ of its
                  existence, is equal to calculations like that, what will not be its ability in the
                  autumn, when its blossoms have ripened by cultivation into poetry, logic,
                  philosophy, mathematics, and everything under heaven that is
                     <emph>reasonable</emph>"——</p>
               <p>"Or unreasonable," added May, quietly.</p>
               <p>"What may not be expected? It is acknowledged that there can be no accounting for
                  the course that the female mind takes"——</p>
               <p>"And great puzzles are the ladies to themselves, and to all mankind connected with
                  them." Mag concluded his comment.</p>
               <p>"Truly, truly! What influences could have developed our Cousin Mag here into a
                  poetess, since 'Poeta nascitur, non fit.'"</p>
               <p>"'Parturiunt montes, nascitur ridiculus mus,'" said Mag. "The last proverb from
                  Horace applies to your remarks, Frank. I hope you see the point."</p>
               <p>"Poets are said to have great capacities for suffering," May remarked.</p>
               <p>"And our Mag takes upon herself infinite pains in cultivating her capacities for
                  suffering."</p>
               <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6426-00000043"/>
               <p>"Would you ever suspect her of the guilt of being sentimental, from present
                  appearances?" asked May.</p>
               <p>"Her resources in that line don't seem to be alarming," Min replied.</p>
               <p>"Yet I can convict her of publishing poetry more pious than funny," said Frank,
                  "in the 'Yale Literary Magazine'—entitled, 'Let us Pray.' The

               <p>"Apropos. Josie Newton boasts that she has jilted you, Frank. Alec initiated
                  her!"</p>
               <p>"I acknowledge the soft impeachment. I have had the honor of suffering for her
                  sweet sake. An inestimable privilege."</p>
               <p>"The devotion of Mr. Ross to the ladies is proverbial," said May.</p>
               <p>"Yes, long habit has established the law in my nature—it commenced in youth's
                  earliest prime. When six months of age, I politely drove my mother to
                  sleigh-rides, as her escort."</p>
               <p>"That was precocious!" ejaculated Min.</p>
               <p>"You were an aspiring youth," May said demurely.</p>
               <p>"Aspiring? Yes, at the riper age of three years, I ascended the ladder of fame to
                  the top of the house and took my seat upon the ridge-pole."</p>
               <p>"Courageous, too!" laughed May.</p>
               <p>"Courageous! Has any one the audacity to doubt it? At four years of age, I mounted
                  a youthful horse that had never been broken."</p>
               <p>"Did <emph>you</emph> break anything ever?" asked May.</p>
               <p>"Well, you see my neck is not broken, though I don't deny that Josie Newton was
                  the cause of my broken heart—but Mag's poetry, as I was saying, is
                  astonishing."</p>
               <p>"Who can that personage be, walking with Alec Ross?" Mag interrupted, as she saw,
                  through the window, two young men. "Hasn't that stranger a splendid figure? Erect,
                  and such a haughty gesture; self-reliance in his step. Well, <emph>he</emph> is
                  proud!"</p>
               <p>"May Burton, keep your eyes this way. You are not to run crazy after every man
                  with erect, proud shoulders. You are not to see any beauty or manliness outside of
                  the gates. I forgot to tell you what I came for this afternoon, Mag. That
                  broad-shouldered youth is a cousin of mine—not yours—a cadet at West Point, from
                  Huntsville, Alabama. Alec sent me to tell you that they would call after tea, for
                  you to entertain him. It is required of you, as a duty, to introduce<pb n="86-87"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000044"/> duce the southern gentleman to New England belles,
                  and to make him appreciate New England moonshine."</p>
               <p>"We will do our best, will we not, Min? I'll do my very best to captivate, won't
                  you, May?"</p>
               <p>"You just take care of your own affairs, Mag, and leave May alone; I'll take
                  charge of her."</p>
               <p>And Mag did her best to captivate him, coquette that she was, and thereby hangs
                  our tale. She cultivated the <emph>arts</emph> of modesty and fascination, to the
                  utmost of her genius—innocent as she was—and gathered the fruits of her
                  labors.</p>
               <p>"What a <emph>man</emph> soweth, that shall he reap." The rule holds true with
                  woman, also.</p>

               <head>VIII. OLLA PODRIDA.</head>
               <p>MAG went to the door to receive her guests. Not till Alec had introduced him, and
                  Frank had engaged his attention with Min, did she have an opportunity of studying
                  Charles Atherton Moore.</p>
               <p>There was a haughty, firm grace in his carriage, but it was owing partially to his
                  cadet training—partially, probably, to firmness of character which reveals itself
                  in the tread, as well as the compression of the lips. He could not entirely throw
                  off the military; he wore it as he wore the undress, half military frock coat,
                  which was, to tell the truth, wonderfully becoming. Mag scanned him with a quick,
                  keen, piercing glance that hid itself, when observed, beneath her long, drooping
                  lashes. She liked the looks of that royal brow, with its jetty, clustering curls.
                  Truth, too, she fancied the firm curve of the proud lips, that indicated with the
                  swelling throat beneath, a world of passion. She fancied the half Greek, half
                  Roman nose with the passionate dilating of the nostril; she noticed the well-knit,
                  powerful frame, and, with the eye of an artiste, was delighted with the
                  development of muscle in every limb. The physical man was perfect; the
                  intellectual man looked regal; of the moral she could not judge. The clear shining
                  of the keen blue eye seemed as if Nature had been prodigal of good gifts to a
                  favorite son. If the physical and moral natures were to to do wild battle against
                  each other with temptation, there was no indication that passion had yet been
                  conqueror, either in the eye's outlook, or in the dazzling radiance that
                     gleamed<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6426-00000045"/> in the smile. He seemed to
                  keep his smiles precious, as too rare to be lavished freely. He gave royal
                  treasures only on royal occasions. All these points Mag noted while he was talking
                  with Min and May, and Alec and Frank were making out a programme of picnics,
                  hunting excursions, and sailing parties, for the introduction of Charles Moore to
                  New England belles and New England life.</p>
               <p>Mag continued her searching observations—it was a habit of hers to study all
                  possible revelations in human faces—the next day when they met him at Dr. Ross',
                  where they called on Grandfather and Grandmother Barclay. Frank enticed the cadet
                  to call with them on his Yankee grandma with his Yankee cousins, assuring him that
                  he would find the entertainment both spicy and racy, and promised him he'd call
                  him off when he'd got enough of the fun.</p>
               <p>Blind Grandfather Barclay sat leaning his bowed head upon his staff as they
                  entered. Frank addressed him in his cheerful tones:</p>
               <p>"Bright, sunshiny day, grandfather! How does it find you to-day?"</p>
               <p>Grandfather lifted his head and a smile came up from his heart, irradiating the
                  wrinkled face with beauty.</p>
               <p>"It is a bright day, my boy. The presence of Jesus brings to an old man sunshine
                  and light in the darkness."</p>
               <p>"I've brought you some visitors, grandfather. Here's Mag and a new cousin of ours,
                  Min Walton, whose father you knew."</p>
               <p>Mag and Min went and shook hands with the patriarch, bidding him good morning.</p>
               <p>"Then here's Aunt Mary Ross' only son, from Alabama, my cousin, Charlie
                  Moore."</p>
               <p>"Glad to see you all, children," said grandfather, as he shook hands with Charlie
                  Moore; "glad to see the young, always. When I get home—and I'm almost there—I
                  shall be young again myself, and then I shall see brighter faces than yours. I see
                  them, and you all, with the eye of <emph>faith</emph> now, you know, but soon
                  faith will be changed to sight.</p>
               <p>"Faith is a great comfort in a world like this, grandfather," said Mag.</p>
               <p>"It is <emph>everything,</emph> my child. It would be a ghastly place without
                  faith in a good God, who has forbearance with the sins of good men and bad."</p>
               <p>"Grandpa is grieving over parish affairs," put in grandma. "Deacon Kimball, last
                  Sunday, opened a book afore the minister's face, right in meeting, and read it all
                  sermon-time, ''cause,' he said, 'he didn't want to hear Taylor's theology,' just
                  as though Dr. Taylor had made a new Bible. I've no use for Deacon Kimball's
                  religion, for I don't believe he has any."</p>
               <p>"We must be charitable, mother," said grandfather; "the Bible says, 'Judge not,
                  lest ye be judged.'"</p>
               <p>"But the Bible says 'Ye shall know them by their fruits,' and the deacon was the
                  very man who built up the Universalist church. If it hadn't been for the
                  revengeful, overbearing way he acted toward the Ardens, in that difficulty of the
                  singing-school, they would all have been going to our meeting now. Mr. Arden said
                  they wanted a gospel of <emph>peace</emph> and <emph>love,</emph> not of
                     <emph>persecution,</emph> so they would build a church to suit their wants. I
                  never shall forgive the deacon for that, and he hates Mr. Arden with his whole
                  heart."</p>
               <p>"But you <emph>must</emph> forgive him, grandma," said Frank; "the Lord says
                  forgive your <emph>enemies,</emph> taking it for granted that you forgive your
                     <emph>brethren</emph> and <emph>children.</emph>" Frank's father, as we have
                  said, was a Universalist, to grandma's continual horror.</p>
               <p>"But Deacon Kimball hasn't any Christian spirit," said grandma.</p>
               <p>"He prays every Sunday, long and loud, for the Lord to forgive his enemies," said
                  Mag, "and with special reference to Mr. Arden."</p>
               <p>"Ah, well," Frank said, wickedly, "don't you understand, Mag? the idea is, that if
                  the <emph>Lord</emph> forgives him, there will be no occasion for doing it
                     <emph>himself.</emph>" Mag sent a quick glance toward grandpa, which Frank
                  interpreted.</p>
               <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6426-00000046"/>
               <p>"When good men do wrong," grandpa answered, "there surely will come a retribution.
                  God will vindicate his ways with men. I believe our church at this day is
                  suffering for the sins of its people toward our old minister, Mr. Parker. It
                  grieves me to the heart to see the meek, venerable, grey-haired old man, sitting
                  in the sanctuary Sabbath after Sabbath—the shepherd turned off in his old age,
                  penniless, by his unworthy, ungrateful flock. The parish never will prosper; the
                  sins of the father will descend in judgment on the children, till there is
                  expiation for that guilt."</p>
               <p>"Yes," added grandma, "and that's why he sent us in his place such a Godless man
                  as Mr. Brown, who, ignorant of God's righteousness, goes about establishing his
                  own righteousness."</p>
               <p>"I wouldn't <emph>say</emph> that of Mr. Brown, mother," grandfather replied.
                  "He's the minister. Don't judge harsh judgments of God's ministers, nor of any
                  one, for the measure ye mete to others will be measured to you again."</p>
               <p>And Frank took up the thread of the discourse with grandfather.</p>
               <p>"You tell me, grandfather, the Lord won't bless any people unless they
                     <emph>obey</emph> him?"</p>
               <p>"And they must obey implicitly, as Abraham obeyed when he gave up Isaac."</p>
               <p>"Asking no questions," added grandma.</p>
               <p>"God gives blessings only on <emph>conditions,</emph>" said Frank.</p>
               <p>"And obedience is the one great condition. Do you not remember the story of Saul
                  and Agag?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, grandfather; I remember it, for you taught me the whole of it," said
                  Frank, "how the Lord told Saul to go and smite the Amalekites, to destroy every
                  mother's son of them—not to spare a thing—not so much as a goat, or an ox, or an
                  ass. But Saul took the big-head, and thought he could improve on his orders. To
                     <emph>prove</emph> to the Lord that he had obeyed him—thinking, maybe, the Lord
                  couldn't find it out—he saved out a lot of the fattest of them to
                     <emph>sacrifice.</emph> But Samuel found it out, and came <emph>down</emph>
                  upon him—blowed him sky-high—asked him why under heaven he hadn't
                     <emph>obeyed</emph> the Lord. 'Why, yes,' said Saul, 'I <emph>have</emph>
                  obeyed. I destroyed every man, woman, and child of them, and brought Agag, the
                  king, to <emph>prove</emph> it, and fatlings to <emph>sacrifice</emph> to the
                  Lord!' And then Samuel let loose his wrath upon him—asked him what he supposed the
                  Lord wanted of his sacrifice; <emph>obedience</emph> was better than sacrifice—to
                  listen to orders better than the fat of rams. Samuel just then cursed him out—told
                  him that the Lord had done with him forever! So he went straight off, hewed Agag
                  in pieces before Saul's eyes, and then started out and anointed David king in the
                  place of Saul."</p>
               <p>Grandfather was accustomed to Frank's wild, earnest talk, and loved the boy.</p>
               <p>"But God promises wonderful blessings to the obedient," said he.</p>
               <p>"Seems to me, it's the wicked ones who prosper in these days," added grandma. "I
                  can't see the use in it, either."</p>
               <p>"The Lord knows his own business, mother. Some day we shall see that what puzzles
                  us here, is <emph>all right.</emph>"</p>
               <p>Here Dr. Ross entered, with his saddlebags on his arm, and Moore inquired of his
                  uncle after the health of the country. He had been leaning, with a sort of
                  careless dignity, against the table, and looked very much more occupied with his
                  own thoughts than with the words of the speakers, though he watched them. And Mag
                  noticed especially the white, rounded, muscular fingers that were beating a tattoo
                  on the table to his meditations.</p>
               <p>"The country," replied Dr. Ross to his polite query, "altogether too healthy! No
                  place for a physician among these hills. People can't get sick if they try.
                  Everybody here dies of old age, if they die at all. I have been trying for the
                  last six months to kill off a woman with consumption, and can't make it out. She
                  is determined to live in spite of me. Everlasting scold she is, too; wore her
                  lungs out scolding—soon as they rest a little, she gets well."</p>
               <p>Min laughed at the good doctor's grumbling.</p>
               <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6426-00000047"/>
               <p>"How far have you ridden to-day, Uncle Ross?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"Well, let's see. First I rode over the hills to Greenland to dose a sick baby—had
                  the croup, or cramp, or convulsions; then I took a triangular cut across to
                  Canton—China, you know—man had the gout; then I took a trail for Patagonia—girl in
                  a decline, love-sick; stopped by way of Liberia to see a sick negro. You keep
                  those articles mostly in your country, Moore."</p>
               <p>Moore smiled. "I believe we do, sir."</p>
               <p>But grandma concluded here to be shocked, and read her son-in-law a lecture. She
                  put on her low, sanctimonious tones:</p>
               <p>"Doctor, I don't think it's <emph>right</emph> for you to exaggerate so. What you
                  said wasn't <emph>truth.</emph> It teaches children to tell lies."</p>
               <p>Frank rolled up his eyes as bigs as saucers, and threw them toward Mag and Min in
                  a comical glance.</p>
               <p>"I believe I did miscall the name of a place or so, mother. I'll try never to do
                  so any more." And he turned to Min and Mag.</p>
               <p>"You must come and take the rounds with me, to-morrow, girls. I have some
                  splendidly vicious horses. Mag has one in training that she drives for me,
                  occasionally."</p>
               <p>"Semi-occasionally, you mean, uncle," said Mag.</p>
               <p>Frank turned to Charlie, and asked in an undertone:</p>
               <p>"Wouldn't you like to hear grandma awhile on the slavery question? She'll give you
                  something rich, if you are equal to it. Shall I call her out?"</p>
               <p>"You are one unconscionable sinner, Frank," was the reply.</p>
               <p>"I say, grandma," he continued, "Charlie and I have been discussing the propriety
                  of Mag's going to Alabama. What do you think of it?" He whispered to Charlie, "I
                  pause for a reply."</p>
               <p>"Well," said grandma, "maybe it's the best thing she could do. She's going to be a
                  schoolma'am, I suppose. Her aunt and uncle have about concluded she'll never be
                  good for anything, without 'tis keeping school. She may as well do it in Alabama
                  as anywhere. I wonder how she'd get along with the negroes?"</p>
               <p>"They would be proud of her as a mistress," said Charlie.</p>
               <p>"Schoolmistress to the negroes!" exclaimed grandma. "Why I thought that was agin
                  the law. Well, she can do it if she wants to, but I've a notion I'd rather stay at
                  home and teach white folks. Did you ever teach the slaves?" she asked of
                  Moore.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I have done it, but I soon gave it up in despair. My attempts were all at
                  Sunday school, and I learnt some rare lessons besides the ones I taught; you know
                  it is always easier to preach goodness than to practise it."</p>
               <p>"I wonder what on earth you'd preach to them."</p>
               <p>"Well, I could not tell all—very proper things, however. I remember one Sunday I
                  got about forty little fellows seated in a circle, and explained to them
                  everything I knew about God; I poured out all my eloquence on the subject; told
                  them that God was never born and would never die; and when I had finished,
                  catechised them to see how much they knew. 'Now,' said I to them, 'can any of you
                  tell me how old God is?' You should have seen the blank, troubled and stupid
                  faces. But I caught the eye of one little fat fellow, about four years of age, and
                  as black as midnight, whose mother had tied him into a window—he <emph>knew</emph>
                  it all. 'Well, out with it, Snowball,' I said. 'God not so berry old after all,
                  Mas Charl,' said he, 'he pretty tol'able young yet.' I gave the rascal a dime for
                  his answer, and closed school. I concluded I could make myself more useful in some
                  other way, than teaching theology."</p>
               <p>"The slaves have meetings by themselves, sometimes?" asked grandpa.</p>
               <p>"Certainly, sir; the custom is, for the whites to have service in the morning, and
                  the servants in the afternoon. If the clergyman has another appointment, some one
                     among<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6426-00000048"/> them usually takes his place. My
                  father, with one of the oldest servants, has charge of the services regularly
                  together, in the absence of the clergyman. Uncle Gabriel is an eloquent exhorter,
                  and does a great deal of good."</p>
               <p>"I'd like to know what he'd preach about," said grandma.</p>
               <p>"I heard him once teach the duty of obedience, in a style that would rival Frank's
                  address a few moments ago. 'Our duty,' he said, 'was to <emph>obey</emph> God, no
                  matter what his orders were. We were not to stop to think whether we would or
                  could obey. Our duty was to <emph>try</emph>—that was what God required of us. If
                  God commanded us to jump through a brick wall, we were not to think whether we
                  could get through it, it was no concern of ours, we must <emph>try</emph>—we must
                     <emph>jump at it,</emph> and God would see to the rest.'"</p>
               <p>"It was the best of theology, too," remarked grandfather.</p>
               <p>Dr. Ross here made a tangent and struck another subject.</p>
               <p>"It was a bright idea of yours, Charlie, studying military tactics."</p>
               <p>"Yes, uncle, I think so; I have a taste for army life."</p>
               <p>"Your Alabama militia have a taste for it. A few years ago, while on a visit there
                  I attended a regimental muster. You southern people do up the warlike with such
                  vengeance, I was interested. The colonel and his staff accomplished the
                     <emph>dignity</emph> alone—wore the uniform for the regiment; the infantry were
                  dressed à-la-mode, rag-tag-and-bobtail; the artillery was composed of poles and
                  split boards, interscattered with a few old muskets; the band consisted of one
                  fiddle, one fife, and one drum; the fife was playing Yankee-doodle, the fiddle
                  performing St. Patrick's-day-in-the-Morning, and the regiment and the drum keeping
                  step to both."</p>
               <p>Charlie smiled, "Which being translated, means, I suppose, that in Alabama, war is
                  an inspiration and not an art. The Madison Rifle Company of Huntsville have
                  improved the military since then."</p>
               <p>Grandma picked up the dropped thread of conversation.</p>
               <p>"It was always a puzzling affair to me, to know how you folks, that never did a
                  useful thing in your lives, can teach your <emph>sarvants</emph> (we call them by
                  their names, <emph>slaves</emph>), how to work. There's always washing, and
                  stewing, and baking, and brewing to be done, and I know you can't tell them how to
                  do a thing, unless you can do it yourself."</p>
               <p>"That is really the trouble in housekeeping, North and South, I believe," said
                  Charlie. "Ladies neglect the useful, to be agreeable."</p>
               <p>"Then," said grandma, "There's the human nature to manage besides, for slaves are
                  human, and not brutes; if they wasn't it's all the same, for human nature and
                  brute nature are to be managed pretty much alike. Alph Fenn is always saying his
                  horses and cattle act worse than Cain, and everybody but himself knows it is
                  because he acts so like Cain with them."</p>
               <p>"Canes them," whispered Frank.</p>
               <p>"He kicks and snarls at every dog and child that comes in his way, and they kick
                  and snarl back again, when they dare. It is so with the slaves, I've no
                  doubt?"</p>
               <p>"The golden rule was wisdom taught by a divine nature," said grandfather.</p>
               <p>"When I was schoolmistress I found out one thing; I couldn't teach what I didn't
                  know myself."</p>
               <p>"It's a great weakness of most minds," said Dr. Ross, "that they are anxious
                  mostly to teach those very things—many people are fond of becoming blind guides."
                  Grandma did not notice his remark.</p>
               <p>"I learned my scholars reading, writing, and some ciphering. I couldn't teach them
                  the Rule of Three, for the Rule of Two was further than I had been in arithmetic.
                  And for <emph>Square</emph> Roots—that was against nature to me; I had seen round
                  roots enough, and crooked roots, and twisted, and tangled, and snarled roots, but
                  when they<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6426-00000049"/> began to branch out on square
                  roots, or q'be roots, or x-y-z roots, I didn't pretend to know one thing about
                  them. Now, how your nice, southern ladies, with their little delicate fingers, can
                  teach their slaves washing, baking, and mending, when they are as ignorant as
                  new-born babies themselves, I don't understand."</p>
               <p>"I don't understand it myself," said Moore.</p>
               <p>"Then there's the sin and abuse of slavery, that everybody in these days goes
                  crazy about. It seems to me, now"——</p>
               <p>"That the least said on the subject here is soonest mended," said Frank.</p>
               <p>"There are none so blind to what is right, as them that won't see."</p>
               <p>"Human nature has the reputation of being perverse," said Charlie.</p>
               <p>"All the reason and Scripture in creation can't make men believe what they don't
                  want to believe. Now, <emph>I</emph> think your slavery is a dreadful curse."</p>
               <p>"Why, grandma, you are preaching Mr. Hobbes' atheistic philosophy in that first
                  proposition of yours. Men believe only what it is their interest to believe," said
                  Frank. "I declare I didn't think you would do so wicked a thing as preach atheism
                  to us children; it might corrupt our morals; it's as bad as telling lies, you
                  know. Now, <emph>I</emph> believe Mr. Hobbes on that point; for example, when
                  women want to believe that it is their duty to <emph>obey</emph> their husbands,
                  not talk in meeting, to stay at home and mind their own business, then they'll see
                  and understand the Bible texts that teach those doctrines."</p>
               <p>"Now, there you are again!" said grandma, "but the nature of things must have
                  become upset sometime. There are women born with men's natures, and some men born
                  half women, and that changes affairs sometimes."</p>
               <p>"And so then the ladies put on the pants. Well, Eve did turn nature topsy-turvy;
                  but the Bible, you know, was written since that upset, to suit the circumstances,
                  and that says plainly that if women want to learn anything, they must do it of
                  their husbands at home, and there is no provision made for men to nurse the babies
                  while the women do the cavorting."</p>
               <p>Grandma indignantly took off her spectacles, straightened her cap-border, and sat
                  like a soldier.</p>
               <p>"The Lord has a use for all sorts of people, or he wouldn't have made them. But
                  you always bring up some scandalous talk, Frank."</p>
               <p>"I merely agreed with you in your opinions, grandma. Men and women believe only
                  what they desire to believe. Do you suppose that all the bibles in Christendom, or
                  all the <emph>laws</emph> from Moses down, could convince you, or Uncle Alph, or
                  any other abolitionist, that the Mosaic <emph>law,</emph> if given by God,
                     <emph>made</emph> slavery to the Israelites <emph>right, sin being a
                     transgression of the law</emph> from the time of Eve, down? And do you suppose
                  that all the reason and preaching in the universe about sin lying <emph>in the
                     nature of things,</emph> could convince a southern fire-eater that the Bible
                  hadn't made slavery <emph>right,</emph> because the laws of the Israelites
                  provided for it and sanctioned it utterly? because Christ did not forbid it—was
                  entirely non-committal on the subject—and because Paul told servants to obey their
                  masters, even the unkind and froward, for it would be a virtue in them to suffer
                  patiently?"</p>
               <p>"Well, well," said grandma, "I don't know anything about slavery, and what's more,
                  I don't want to. It seems to me it's like a big cancer; it comes from disease in
                  the blood and heart of things You may doctor it till doomsday, but you'll never
                  cure it—it will be a cancer till the end. I suppose the Lord has a good reason for
                  letting all these things be, though I can't see it. I wish I could."</p>
               <p>"Don't you think, grandma, the Lord is able to take care of his own business?
                  There are a great many people in this world who are exceedingly anxious, not only
                  to help the Lord in his business, but to tell him also exactly <emph>how it ought
                     to be done.</emph>"</p>
               <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6426-00000050"/>
               <p>"I never saw another boy like you, Frank. It is dreadful wicked for you to talk
                  so, just for the sake of hearing yourself talk."</p>
               <p>"No; sometimes I talk for the sake of hearing my grandmother talk. I think we both
                  talk amazingly well; both unusually sensible and interesting people."</p>
               <p>Grandma's ruffled spirits began to be mollified. Frank went on:</p>
               <p>"This America is a free country. As American citizens, we have not only a right to
                  our opinions here, but we have a right to express them. Liberty of thought, and
                  liberty of speech, is America's boast. Even truth ought not to be spoken at all
                  times. When the expressed thought tends to rouse bitter feelings, to do harm
                  without accomplishing any good; when it uselessly excites brother against brother,
                  as in politics and religion, then let thought be silent. I do not love Charlie the
                  less for his being a full-blooded Southron, with the southern prejudices in his
                  very marrow. He does not love me the less for my telling him that I believe
                  slavery to be a terrible <emph>curse</emph> to our country. If we turn against
                  each other, and hate each other for our opinions, that will not make the wrong
                  right; it deepens the curse, as when Christian men dispute about the
                     <emph>letter</emph> of the law, till they outrage the <emph>spirit,</emph> and
                  their own spirits become poisoned with envy and jealousy. Charlie and I will
                     <emph>love</emph> each other at least. The Man-God said that <emph>love</emph>
                  was the fulfilling of the law. If we differ as to our thought of right and wrong,
                  we can better reconcile the difference, and work away the evil while loving each
                  other, than if we hate each other. A house divided against itself cannot stand.
                  Union is strength, and peace, and happiness. He shall have my hand and heart with
                  those sentiments, now and forever."</p>
               <p>"Bravo! bravo! Frank," said Dr. Ross, with a round of applause, in which Charlie,
                  Min and Mag joined him. "I'll send you to Congress, sure as guns! See if I
                  don't."</p>
               <p>"Please, uncle, send me, too. I want to go to Congress!" said Mag.</p>
               <p>"I've no doubt you'll go, you witch, if you once take the idea into your head. All
                  heaven and earth can't prevent you if once you start!"</p>
               <p>"You may go with me, Miss Magdalene, when I am Congressman. I'll give you the
                  invitation now," said Charlie Moore.</p>
               <p>"Thank you, sir! Please don't forget it," said Mag.</p>
               <p>The conversation bubbled on till the party rose to go. Frank proposed a stroll to
                  Glenlyn Falls, to show Charlie and Min the lions.</p>
               <p>Mag concluded her mental observations on Charlie thus:</p>
               <p>"There are traces of precious pride in the curl of those Byronic lips. I cannot
                  understand the language that passion has written around the lineaments of the
                  mouth. He has explored regions of experience of which I cannot dream. He has lived
                  in an unknown land."</p>
               <p>No, Mag, your home among those hills, little as you think it, has been a sanctuary
                  to you. Perhaps it would be better for you to die there in blissful ignorance of
                  the knowledge which brings sorrow with thought, than gather the fruits of the tree
                  of good and evil. It blossoms abundantly in the great world; but God will order
                  your life in his great wisdom. He will give knowledge and sorrow, if to him it
                  seems right; and you will be guided by your spirit, and by his Spirit, if you seek
                  it, to the experience that he thinks best for you.</p>
               <p>"There are glorious regions of sunshine in the depths of his eye; but God alone
                  knows what strange passions may yet bring storm and tempest there. Chateaubriand
                  said of Washington: 'There is a virtue in the <emph>look</emph> of a good man.'
                  There is a <emph>virtue</emph> in the look of a good man; then all men who are
                  good looking should possess virtue. Charlie Moore should possess uncommon virtue,
                  for he is uncommonly good looking. There are, however, several sides to Monsieur
                  Chateaubriand's proposition. There is virtue<pb n="100-101"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000051"/> in the look of a good man; there must be
                     <emph>vice</emph> in the look of a bad man, for the thoughts of men continually
                  chisel away upon the features. A bad looking man cannot possess virtue. There are
                  grains of truth in all this. The conclusion is clear as light, if one could only
                  see it. Charles Atherton Moore <emph>looks</emph> one of nature's noblemen. The
                  seal of royalty seems stamped upon every feature. He will work against nature, if
                  he works out his own ruin."</p>
               <p>Mag concluded her reverie by helping Aunt Lina make tea when she and Min returned
                  from Glenlyn Falls.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>IX. HOLIDAY LIFE.</head>
               <p>ON the next holiday, Min was busy helping Mag, who was maid of all work for Aunt
                  Lina. May Burton was coming to spend the day. Mag made herself as nearly
                  ubiquitous as possible; she made the beds, aired the chambers, and dusted the
                  parlor in double-quick time. Then there followed a chorus, or duet—a mighty
                  beating of eggs and butter, a stirring of sugar and cream, for cakes and
                  custards.</p>
               <p>"I don't see what can have possessed you, this morning, Mag!" said Aunt Lina, in
                  astonishment at the development of her housekeeping capacities. "Something must be
                  going to happen."</p>
               <p>"Any number of things, aunty. We are to spend the day in the woods, when May
                  comes."</p>
               <p>May came alone in her father's buggy, and the first item in the day's programme,
                  was a drive over the hills. The three came back in fine spirits, and as neither
                  Uncle Alph nor the hired man was at home, and Mag did not choose to go to Uncle
                  Ross' for Frank, she unharnessed the horse herself, introducing Min and May to the
                  mysteries of straps and buckles. Off went the gear—Mag and Min both mounted the
                  animal, May led him by the mane, and in this style they escorted him to the
                  pasture for the day. They then kept on through the groves, over the hills, to
                  Glenlyn Falls, gathering flowers and leaves as they went. They chattered all
                  manner of nonsense that the sex usually concoct for such occasions, Mag and Min
                  being most voluble;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6426-00000052"/> stumbling upon
                  those marvellous subjects, Love and Friendship, as all girls will—for if any one
                  supposes it possible for three school-girls to talk for an hour without discussing
                  love, friendship, and the gentlemen, that person is in most bewildering ignorance
                  of school-girl nature. Min declared, in her half-jesting way, that she had been
                  once engaged! but alas, alas! the course of true love never did run smooth, and
                  the course her love took was over quicksands and rocks, and then among breakers
                  and whirlpools.</p>
               <p>"Love and Friendship are very similar people," said May, "very near
                  kindred—cousins if not brothers."</p>
               <p>"Do you mean your cousin or mine?" asked Mag; and then she fell into a long
                  sentimental reverie, during which she made a garland of oak leaves, that she
                  twisted into Min's hair.</p>
               <p>"I say, Min, Love is a cruel tyrant. He can absorb every feeling, thought and
                  hope, in a woman's nature. If ever I love, I intend to do it entirely. I shall
                  give my heart 'lavishly, carelessly, utterly.'" And Mag quoted, <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Give, as the morning that flows out of heaven,</l>
                        <l>Give, as the waves when their channel is riven,</l>
                        <l>Give as the free air and sunshine are given."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"You'll never do anything of the sort, Mag Barclay," Min said in answer to the
                  sentimental quotation. You can't pour yourself out in that profuse way, till you
                  find some powerful human being to <emph>call you out!</emph> I must compliment
                  you; you'll not soon find your equal, and it must be a <emph>superior</emph> that
                  would bring out your nature."</p>
               <p>"I shall idealize some mortal and do it, no doubt; it is the fate of women to do
                  that. It will be my fate also, <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"'To give as the heart gives whose fetters are breaking,</l>
                        <l>Life, love, and hope, all my dreams and my waking.'"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"Much good may it do you," said Min, laughing. "To do it, you will be obliged to
                  blind yourself to faults and human weaknesses."</p>
               <p>"Beautiful Love! Tyrant Love! Could Love reign forever, humanity would become
                  purified, faultless, divine! Glorious, <emph>blind</emph> Love!"</p>
               <p>Mag seemed to be going into ecstasies at the bare idea.</p>
               <p>"Love was keen-sighted when I knew him," Min replied, with a quizzical look. "If
                  he had only been more <emph>blinded,</emph> it would have saved me a world of
                  tribulation." Mag followed out her mood, till May came to the rescue.</p>
               <p>"He <emph>was</emph> blind, but his eyes have been opened. In Eden one day, they
                  were opened by sin, to the knowledge of deformity and sorrow. Poor Love!"</p>
               <p>"That accounts for the trouble I fell into," said Min, as a comical sparkle danced
                  into her eyes. "My love's eyes were <emph>opened</emph> one day to my deformity.
                  Did I ever tell you how my <emph>hopes were blighted?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Blighted? Sure enough? Every one of them? Never, Min, never!"</p>
               <p>"It was an overwhelming experience. And it all happened on account of Love's want
                  of blindness—that is, his sharp-sightedness."</p>
               <p>"Your remarks are, if not <emph>fact,</emph> at least <emph>founded</emph> on
                  fact, they are not entirely <emph>fictional?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Founded on the fact that my <emph>nose</emph> has been an unfortunate member of
                  my system; small as it is, it has thus far proved the greatest trouble of my
                  life."</p>
               <p>The unfortunate member of Min's countenance was small, beautifully shaped,
                  inclining to the Roman style.</p>
               <p>"What <emph>little</emph> troubles most of yours have been!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, but this was shocking, what there was of it. Why did nobody ever make love
                  to me? The reason is as plain as the nose on my face."</p>
               <p>"Nobody at all?" asked May, grievously.</p>
               <p>"Well, he wan't much of anybody, and it happened, too, on a winter's night, cold
                  as Greenland's icy mountains."</p>
               <p>"Far off in the dim and distant past, more than a thousand<pb n="104-105"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000053"/> sand years ago," said May, demurely, as if
                  commencing a ghost story.</p>
               <p>"But I remember my forlorn hope, as distinctly as if it had been yesterday. He was
                  as tall as a steeple—that is, a short steeple, and he had hair of a shade between
                  sunny, sandy and auburn."</p>
               <p>"Bright red," suggested May.</p>
               <p>"Exactly; and an eye, or may-be a nose; yes, it was the nose, like a hawk—that is,
                  it turned neither to the right nor left, yet kept not straight on its way, but
                  inclined first to the zenith, then to the nadir."</p>
               <p>"Aquiline," pronounced Mag. "We shall get the list of his perfections."</p>
               <p>"And there was not a spark of fire in the room, with the exception of him and
                  myself, and we stood over the frozen ashes, he, with his <emph>right</emph> elbow
                  leaning on the mantel, I, with my <emph>left</emph> elbow ditto."</p>
               <p>"Are you sure there is no mistake about the position of those elbows?" asked
                  May.</p>
               <p>"I couldn't be any more sure if I was before a jury. He told me, without moving
                  his elbow—I kept my eye upon it—that I was a witch, a sorceress, an enchantress, a
                  great many more such people, too 'numerous to mention,' as the newspapers say; so
                  I took the hint and nearly exhausted myself, to keep up my reputation, and look
                  bewitching, and at last he <emph>popped the question!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Min! Min! You are not in earnest? Did anything else break?"</p>
               <p>"Day began to break, but there was not much of a crash."</p>
               <p>"But I don't see the point to the tale yet," said Mag.</p>
               <p>"No; but the point will be along at the proper time. All my life long I had craved
                  the flattering unction of being thought beautiful. As love is <emph>blind,</emph>
                  I thought my time had come. So, at last, I ventured to ask this love of mine if he
                  did not then think me a very handsome creature. At my question, he deliberately
                  straightened himself starward, surveyed me with his azure eyes over his hawk nose,
                  as a pussy surveys a delinquent mouse when she holds it in her paws, and told me,
                  No, not he; he didn't think me at all handsome. Imagine my feelings!"</p>
               <p>"The rock of her last hope was shivered," quoted Mag.</p>
               <p>"He informed me that my forehead was unique; my hair and eyes respectable,
                     <emph>of their kind;</emph> my chin passable; my mouth inexpressibly sweet; my
                  complexion like that of a peach <emph>ripening.</emph> I suppose he meant the
                  peach was not yet ripe, but would be."</p>
               <p>"A <emph>verdant</emph> peach."</p>
               <p>"The insinuation is vile. I could not summon courage to mention my nose; and, oh,
                  he never mentioned it!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, we never, never!" exclaimed Mag, with an accent of despair, and a clasp of
                  the hands a la Rachel in tragedy.</p>
               <p>"Love <emph>blind!</emph> He was Argus-eyed. The very next day I received a little
                  perfumed 'billet' that proved anything but 'doux,' in which he excused himself for
                  having popped the question—recalled said question—and, alas for my budding hopes,
                  all blighted!"</p>
               <p>"How very high his grapes did hang," said May.</p>
               <p>"It was a sad satisfaction to know that they were nipped in the <emph>bud.</emph>
                  What if they had blossomed first? What if I had trusted in the proverbial might of
                  love's <emph>blindness,</emph> till I found that the scales had fallen from his
                  eyes, by his suing for a divorce and damages?"</p>
               <p>"Love and friendship are both <emph>fractional</emph> quantities," said Mag.</p>
               <p>"Especially when they are <emph>broken.</emph> Witness Min's sad love," said
                  May.</p>
               <p>"We do not taste life in its royal fullness till we know the deep meaning of the
                  word friendship," said Mag.</p>
               <p>"A profound remark, which I might illustrate as luminously as I have illustrated
                  the might of Love's want of blindness. It is a proposition bursting with
                  truth."</p>
               <p>"The quotation of David and Jonathan is sufficient," Mag replied. "There
                     <emph>are</emph> loves stronger than death. In them we recognize the divinity
                  in humanity."</p>
               <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6426-00000054"/>
               <p>"You are growing so shockingly serious, Mag, you have gone beyond my depth. I
                  never had any experience of the loves of any other life than this, so I don't
                  know, and can't say."</p>
               <p>"In this life we see friendship, love, and truth are imperfect, never satisfying;
                  love never satisfies. A woman's heart has a thousand delicate yearnings of which a
                  man's strong nature can have no conception."</p>
               <p>"And <foreign xml:lang="LAT">vice versâ</foreign>—a woman has not the slightest
                  idea of all the wanderings of man's nature into strange and unfathomable recesses,
                  where woman may never enter; so, at times, lovers the most devoted find the
                  society of their adored most excruciatingly tiresome."</p>
               <p>"Somebody says: 'There are grains of truth in the wildest fable,'" May added.</p>
               <p>"It seems to be the fashion for school-girls in these days to dip into the
                  philosophical, and pass it around to their friends," said Min, as gravely as if a
                  profound idea had struck her with astonishment. "Mag, I see a grape-vine that has
                  climbed a tree. It has set a praiseworthy example, suppose we follow it."</p>
               <p>Mag swung herself up, and found a seat congenial to lofty aspirations. Min also
                  said she had "perched herself into a limbo," while May declared that she never had
                  any ambition to be suspended between heaven and earth.</p>
               <p>"It's a delightful state of suspense," said Mag; "a vibration amid the beautiful,
                  the mind and spirit in lofty equilibrium."</p>
               <p>"I'm <emph>afraid</emph> of this vine while you are rocking so!" exclaimed
                  Min.</p>
               <p>"One needs <emph>faith</emph> in climbing trees, Min, I know by experience, just
                  as one needs it in climbing ladders to fame, and so forth. If you have no
                     <emph>faith,</emph> you'll never <emph>attempt</emph> to climb; and, if you
                  lose your faith, your head will turn giddy, and, of course, there will come a
                  crash to all your hopes. In all climbing undertakings in this world, your success
                  will depend upon <emph>faith.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"According to your faith be it unto you," said May. "You need the faith Cromwell
                  had, Min; faith in your own energy."</p>
               <p>"Which, expressed in words, sounds thus: 'Trust in God and <emph>keep your powder
                     dry,</emph>' Min," added Mag.</p>
               <p>"Oh!" said Min, in a tone of ineffable satisfaction, "I'll do it—keep every spark
                  of it dry up here—so don't waste any of your brilliant shots on me, there'll be an
                  explosion."</p>
               <p>Just at this state of affairs, Frank Ross and Charles Moore made their appearance
                  on the scene of action. Frank was malicious enough to enjoy the confusion of the
                  actors, and to make the most of their blushes.</p>
               <p>"I believe you are fond of natural history, especially ornithology. Let me
                  introduce you to a species of blackbirds that infest our New England woods, Cousin
                  Charlie."</p>
               <p>Charlie lifted his half-military cap to the specimens.</p>
               <p>"You are up in a <emph>quandary</emph> now, Mag," said Frank.</p>
               <p>"Min and myself form a di-lemma."</p>
               <p>"Can we relieve you in any manner?" asked Charlie.</p>
               <p>"No relief necessary. We are equal to any such emergency. There is a charm in the
                  situation. If you would like to try it, I might give up my place to you for a
                  time."</p>
               <p>"Permit me to share it, and we shall form a tri-lemma."</p>
               <p>And Charlie ascended while Frank repeated: <q>
                     <l>"Zaccheus he, a lady to see, did climb a tree."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"We can all testify that Frank has studied his primer faithfully," said Mag,
                  coming <emph>down</emph> with abound, as Charlie went <emph>up,</emph> leaving the
                  vines "all in a tremble green." Frank gravely helped Min out of her "limbo;" and,
                  at last, they all started over the hills together, through the pasture, toward the
                  village.</p>
               <p>"And what heathenish songs have those strange birds sung to you, May?" asked
                  Frank.</p>
               <p>"Enlightened me wonderfully on the subjects of friendship, love and truth."</p>
               <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6426-00000055"/>
               <p>"Agreeing with Byron, of course, that Friendship is a mere fiction of a disordered
                  fancy?"</p>
               <p>"That was something like the rule they laid down. They made exceptions; the
                  exception proves the rule, you know."</p>
               <p>"I make at least five hundred exceptions of my <emph>dearest friends,</emph>" Min
                  exclaimed.</p>
               <p>"Mag has more faith in theoretical than practical friendship. The
                     <emph>theory</emph> she seems to consider superb," said May.</p>
               <p>"The idea of disinterested friendship is simply absurd; for instance: Mag now, of
                  herself, is nothing to me, and she knows it; she makes herself useful to me,
                  however; she is the medium by which I have access to what interests me—the
                     <emph>ladies</emph> who visit her. May is the principal item. Mag is my key to
                  May's society—to Min's regard. No doubt, your esteem for her, is owing entirely to
                  your regard for us, gentlemen."</p>
               <p>"There really are <emph>fragments</emph> of truth in your remarks," said Min.</p>
               <p>"Frank has always had an unhappy propensity for tearing the truth into fragments,
                  whenever, by chance, he approaches it," Mag remarked; "and that, unfortunately, is
                  not as often as could be desired."</p>
               <p>They came to May's horse, quietly feeding in the pasture.</p>
               <p>"You pride yourself on your bravery, Frank," said Min. "Do you believe, now, you
                  would <emph>dare</emph> ride that horse <emph>alone?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Not unless you would promise to hold him for me, and lead him carefully. I might
                  fall; I should be badly scared, I know."</p>
               <p>"We will lead him, Frank," said Min, starting after the animal with May. By
                  superhuman efforts, Frank overcame his fears and mounted, and they went home, Min
                  leading him—the horse, not Frank, by the mane—May calling back to Mag, "Tableau
                  vivant! Don Quixote, Rosinante and Sancho Panza."</p>
               <p>Mag and Charlie were left to their own entertainment. Mag made the first effort
                  toward a remark to commence acquaintance.</p>
               <p>"I hope your energies were not entirely fatigued by finding your path through this
                  wilderness."</p>
               <p>"Wilderness! We considered ourselves rovers through Paradise, searching for a
                  wandering Eve." And our unsophisticated Mag blushed at the gallantry, not being
                  accustomed then to the style. She got safely over the surprise.</p>
               <p>"Instead of Eve, you met the serpent, and took lessons in the art of beguiling,"
                  she replied.</p>
               <p>"There was no serpent in the paradise I entered, and I am sure the Eve I have
                  found never listens to the voice of the charmer, charm he never so wisely."</p>
               <p>"How can you know? Perhaps the serpent has hidden himself away in the heart of the
                  Eve of your companionship, and listens continually to his hissing whispers. You
                  may discover him yet, coiled in the charmed places."</p>
               <p>"If he glances out from beneath those lashes, I shall invite the charm and dare
                  his power. I could dare the Prince of Darkness himself, come he as serpent or arch
                  demon, while those eyes were on me with their spell."</p>
               <p>"You seem to have met him and learned his language. Are you sure you are not
                  playing the part of the enemy himself, disguised as a friend?"</p>
               <p>"Do you see any traces of the serpent in my face? Can you read the language he has
                  written there? Knowing me not at all, would you venture on an opinion of me
                  now?"</p>
               <p>"You are a commingling of light and darkness—a combination of all opposite
                  qualities," Mag said, without astonment.</p>
               <p>A smile broke over the gentleman's face, which radiated a sudden light.</p>
               <p>"There is shrewdness in your guess, there is policy in your answer—or tact,
                  rather. May I guess at your nature also?"</p>
               <p>"I am curious to know your opinion, formed at a glance.'</p>
               <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6426-00000056"/>
               <p>"It may change in a week, but you shall have my present verdict. You, too, are a
                  commingling of all opposite elements—olla podrida—a sunshine-storm. Your heart is
                  full of both fire and dew; it is at times hard as adamant, at times soft as a
                  mother's pity. You are both Cressida and Juno. The vein of humor in your system
                  prevents your manifesting reverence. You will never be distinguished for your
                  devout piety; you are incapable of the devotion that never smiles. God gave you
                  that playful humor, you must control it whenever you become a church-member. You
                  may become an angel of light, or"——He paused.</p>
               <p>"Or a demon of darkness," finished Mag. "You think my faculties are in an inchoate
                  state, and will need careful training. At least, I am <emph>conscientious,</emph>
                  though wanting in reverence and devotion. If ever I see an object worthy of
                  reverence, mine will not be wanting."</p>
               <p>"I have no doubt your conscience is your strong point. That is your house of
                  refuge; your reserved corps in danger; your imperial guard. You must keep a watch
                  on constant duty over it."</p>
               <p>"What wealth of language the <emph>military</emph> acquire! I thank you for your
                  sincerity. I like it better than the flattery with which you commenced. You dare
                  tell me an unpalatable truth. We shall be friends yet, if you will pursue that
                  path."</p>
               <p>"You are fond of extracting secrets from human hearts. Take the key to my heart,
                  Miss Barclay, I will give you permission to enter, and dive into all the secrets
                  you can find."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, again. I might find it a dangerous experiment. I am a coward at times;
                  I should fear committing sacrilege."</p>
               <p>"You'll find plenty of rubbish in the apartments. I hope you will be kind enough
                  to sweep down the cobwebs on the walls, and kindle a fire on the hearth-stones.
                  The rooms are cold; I know your presence will be genial. You will find some altars
                  and shrines thrown down; a ruthless less hand has done it; you may place incense
                  upon them again, and make them holy."</p>
               <p>"I might have unhallowed curiosity about those shrines: I am wanting in reverence
                  and devotion."</p>
               <p>"Your atmosphere would be purifying; would charm away evil. I would guard the
                  entrance so that nothing should harm you."</p>
               <p>"I should find handwriting on the walls, that neither prophets nor soothsayers
                  could decipher for me; or if a Daniel came, I should hear 'Mene, mene,
                  tekel!'"</p>
               <p>"Then you doubt me? You refuse to be my guest? Doubt and suspicion are ignoble
                  qualities; but you are more than half right—I have not proved myself worthy. Be
                  assured, I intend to do so, and fit up the apartments for your reception."</p>
               <p>"Have you a treasury there?"</p>
               <p>"In some of the secret drawers you will find a few withered rose-buds that I have
                  treasured sacredly, and one curl of golden hair; you would preserve them
                  holy."</p>
               <p>"Would you allow me to penetrate to the central depths?"</p>
               <p>"You would find them terribly torn up—the ruins of volcanoes, whose fires have
                  already burnt out in my youth; the ruins are rocky now, and the rocks overrun with
                  briers and brambles, and these full of spiders and hornets!"</p>
               <p>"Terrible convulsions must have shaken the grounds! You must cultivate them, now
                  that the fires are extinct, and make an Eden of the place," Mag said,
                  laughing.</p>
               <p>"If I could but find an Eve to help me!"</p>
               <p>"Eve destroyed her Eden, and it was never redeemed."</p>
               <p>"Pity, isn't it, Miss Barclay, that I cannot get some one to pour a few affections
                  into those extinct craters? It would warm me into vitality, when I felt the whole
                  heart frozen! They tell me you have a way of reaching and influencing hearts,
                  known to but few of your sex. Where did you acquire the strange knowledge?"</p>
               <p>"I have learned one way, uncommon to ladies, of reaching<pb n="112-113"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000057"/> hearts, Mr. Moore. I learned it while practising
                  pistol-shooting. Whenever I fail to reach the divinity in man by other means, that
                  will not fail me."</p>
               <p>"It is a cool-blooded remark, Miss Barclay. You can set the divine
                     <emph>free</emph> from the human?"</p>
               <p>"When the human degrades the divine. Are you fond of pistol-shooting?"</p>
               <p>"I shall be if you will practise with me. Do not aim at my heart; it is sore and
                  wounded already."</p>
               <p>"We will try the pistols when we get home; and I will promise never to send a ball
                  to your heart till the divinity within has already departed."</p>
               <p>Charlie Moore saw an arch smile playing hide-and-seek under the long, drooping
                  lashes. If there was meaning to the badinage, it hid itself in the sunshine around
                  the lips that uttered it. They went home and amused themselves for an hour
                  shooting at a mark, while May, Min and Frank discussed the loftiest flights of
                  nonsense in philosophy and human nature.</p>
               <p>"I am perfectly astonished at you, Mag!" was Aunt Lina's comment, as they all came
                  in at last; "I never did see any one like you! I'd be ashamed to shoot with
                  pistols in that style. Josie Newton never would do it." She turned to Frank. "You
                  and your cousin must take tea with the girls, Frank, they'll be disappointed if
                  you don't. They've been preparing for you."</p>
               <p>Mag was amazed! "Permit me, Miss Barclay, to inform you that I am astonished!"
                  said she to herself. "I am <emph>twice astonished!</emph> The astonishment may
                  manifest human weakness in me; also the disinterested benevolence which has
                  produced it, may be a fearful symptom of a disordered mind in Aunt Lina. Events
                  calculated to produce astonishment will happen! We cannot prevent them with our
                  vastest endeavors. Miss Barclay, I announce to you the simple fact, without trying
                  to fathom the cause, for full five minutes I have been <emph>immensely
                     astonished!</emph>"</p>
               <p>Frank and Charlie stayed to tea.</p>

               <head>X. REVELATIONS.</head>
               <p>THE sentimental season with these specimens of humanity was now in its full glory.
                  It comes to <emph>all</emph> perfectly developed natures once in a lifetime, and
                  it comes, too, when life is arched with rainbows.</p>
               <p>The glory fades at last. The dreams and aspirations of youth pale into realities.
                  Our idols lose their charms. Intellectual natures console themselves after the
                  charms of their passion-dreams have flown, by the rush of thought into regions of
                  intellectual intoxication; other natures degenerate, and live by sense—pass life
                  in the daily round of common duties, feeding the senses instead of the heart and
                  intellect.</p>
               <p>A part of humanity forget their youth, to degenerate into an animal life. A part
                  rise into a life of stern and <emph>solitary</emph> thought, and look back with a
                  kind of scornful regret upon the disappointed passion-dreams of their youth. Yet
                  those dreams were all heaven-born, and their glory will be renewed in those
                  regions of bliss where light is love, and the nature of humanity is
                     <emph>perfected.</emph> Men do their best natures wrong when they despise the
                  hopes, loves and aspirations of youth in its glory-time of passion and
                  romance.</p>
               <p>Mag exerted her powers to make Charlie Moore appreciate New England fascinations
                  in nature and art, in earth and heaven, and he became charmed with New England
                  belles and with New England moonshine. The pic-nics, sailing parties and
                  equestrian excursions came off according to arrangement.</p>
               <p>Mag brought, for entertainment, all the resources of her<pb n="114-115"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000058"/> genius and cultivation; became romantic,
                  sentimental, philosophic, poetic, and theologic. She "did her best to captivate
                  the cadet," taking infinite pains, however, in all her efforts, to manifest to him
                  a supreme indifference to his regard. She seasoned the most piquant of her graces
                  with the most charming modesty—the most exquisite audacity with the most demure
                  unconsciousness—making herself toward him the most delicious of all forbidden
                  fruit. The result was——</p>
               <p>On the evening before his departure, Charlie and Mag, Frank and Min, went on a
                  long, last ramble to the Falls of Glenlyn. Night came upon them, with its
                  moonshine, before they reached home, inspiring their spirits with the double
                  distilled essence of sublimated poetry.</p>
               <p>We should extract every atom of sweetness in the cup of life, during this phase of
                  development, for there is nothing like it, else in life. It is an insanity, a
                  delirium; but in its freshness and purity it is surpassingly sweet—it is
                  passionately innocent and beautiful.</p>
               <p>"Strange tales the winds are whispering in the gloaming," said Mag; "how sweetly
                  their voices rise and swell and melt and murmur! What a holy breathing presence
                  descends at nightfall!"</p>
               <p>Moore paused, lifted his hat, swept back the raven curls from his brow; his eye
                  swept over earth and sky, and lingered in its glance for the beauty to fill his
                  soul. And while he lingered, Frank and Min strolled homeward.</p>
               <p>He replied at last, making her thought harmonious:</p>
               <p>"Yes, at twilight faith visits us; we forget our pity for frailty, falsehood and
                  misery. At twilight, when we introspect our being, we find the noonday
                  passions—hot, dusty and weary with care—all sleeping. Scorn, distrust and
                  suspicion—our contempt and compassion for human weakness—all are hushed to repose,
                  soothed by the holy mysterious calm. The spirit of beauty descends—sweeps away the
                  earth-clouds that obscure our vision, and we know that amid the clatter and
                  clashing and clangor of strife, an eager, earnest energy has grown with human
                  growth, and strengthened with human strength, during the morning and noontide
                  which, at nightfall, reigns a divinity. When the solemn twilight has passed into
                  midnight, it reigns omnipotent."</p>
               <p>"Wild dream-music the waters are bringing us at this dreaming hour," said Mag; and
                  Moore again gave the responsive note:</p>
               <p>"Yet in the morning the wavelets go lilting on their way, in a chorus of glad,
                  hopeful laughter! At noon they seem weary with the life-rush, and struggle among
                  the breakers. At eventide their melody is of rest. They murmur, as now, their
                  sweet inspiration of love-music, bewildering our very spirits, as it wooes them to
                  join in love's blissful refrain."</p>
               <p>Here Mag took the alarm. This tone of gallantry, so common in the South, when
                  gentlemen entertain ladies, is rare in New England, and those belles were obliged
                  to ward it off as best their instincts taught them.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Moore, you will certainly distinguish yourself if you continue to wax
                  sentimental. That was a desperate flight."</p>
               <p>He smiled, and they strolled on. The stars came out, one by one, in the clear
                  moonlight, and he commenced talking star-music to his listener, while those starry
                  eyes in heaven were sparkling. He directed her eyes to them.</p>
               <p>"Beautiful are they in their pure homes; but starry eyes on earth, sleeping
                  beneath long, dark lashes, now beguile my heart from heaven itself by their bright
                  witchery."</p>
               <p>Mag laughed, and clapped her hands in token of applause.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Moore, are you sure you composed all those pretty things entirely by
                  yourself? And did you study on them long? And did they disturb your slumbers and
                  rob your brain of repose, while they were busy there? To what golden-haired lady
                  did you first rehearse them?"</p>
               <p>"They were born from the inspiration of the hour, and the presence that is now
                  bewitching me," he replied.</p>
               <pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6426-00000059"/>
               <p>"Your remarks on <emph>star</emph>-ology are exceedingly <emph>brilliant,</emph>"
                  said Mag, with a desperate effort at a pun, poor child, for which she must be
                  forgiven. "While you are indulging in reveries so romantic, you may consider it
                  apropos for me to become romantic also, but unless you can teach me, you will be
                  obliged to excuse me."</p>
               <p>"I am a student, not teacher, fathoming the mysteries of earth, not heaven; you
                  can aid me in my studies."</p>
               <p>"We will pursue them together," said Mag. "I too am fathoming the things of earth.
                  We shall probably find our lessons mysteries at last."</p>
               <p>"The veil of <emph>mist</emph>-ery in your wit so clouds my senses and intellect,
                  so folds itself in fleecy radiance around my heart, that I am conscious of but one
                  lesson in the universe worthy of study. Miss Barclay, men say that <emph>Mystery
                     is beautiful.</emph> I have seen you, and <emph>know</emph> it."</p>
               <p>"Thank you; it is cool and refreshing, to listen to pointed complimentary
                  badinage, when one is sure it is original. And, Mr. Moore, you can continue the
                  exercises, by something still more remarkably piquant, for my entertainment. You
                  are in good practice—just from your flirtation in encampment life—accustomed to
                  these things, and I am in mood for enjoying them in this bewildering
                  moonlight."</p>
               <p>Charlie took refuge in the pedantic, dear fellow, responding:</p>
               <p>"Quo-usque tandem abutere meâ patientiâ, O Magdalene?"</p>
               <p>"Was that really <emph>original?</emph> Let me congratulate you on your success!
                  That comes from your own intellect? from the head rising so royally above those
                  shoulders? reposing so serenely beneath that chapeau? Verily, you deserve
                     '<foreign xml:lang="LAT">caput</foreign>'-al reward or punishment, for an
                  effort so sublime. 'Lilia date plenis manibus.'"</p>
               <p>Our neophytes being at the pedantic age must be excused.</p>
               <p>"It came from my <emph>heart</emph>—that target for your ridicule; my heart, which
                  I have thrown under your feet, that you may amuse yourself with its torture. You
                  have no mercy. It is worse to me than Et tu Brute, but my pain is joy to you."</p>
               <p>"Poor thing! poo thing!" said Mag, in the tone of grief she would have used to a
                  sick kitten. "Does it ache dreadfully? But it will feel better when it gets
                  through aching. And if it did not, what can't be cured must be endured—poo
                  thing!"</p>
               <p>Charlie took up the little <emph>left</emph> hand that rested on his arm, and
                  placed the <emph>right</emph> hand in place of it.</p>
               <p>"Have you any <emph>sinister</emph> motives in your wild ridicule and irony? You
                  are very <emph>dextrous</emph> with the weapons of wit."</p>
               <p>Moore's tones were low and grave. There was a world of eloquent reproach in the
                  keen, deep glance he fastened upon hers. He forced her to meet that reproachful
                  look.</p>
               <p>"When I receive '<emph>left-handed</emph>' compliments, if possible, I give them
                     '<emph>right</emph>' back again, and I '<emph>manu</emph>'-facture my own
                  witticisms. I do not borrow from the descendants of the prophets themselves."</p>
               <p>"You are indeed merciless. Pleading is useless."</p>
               <p>"You must plead earnestly—so persuasively that your words cannot be mistaken for
                  sarcasm."</p>
               <p>Charles Moore again arrested their footsteps to look down upon the lips that were
                  uttering such music.</p>
               <p>"And, Mr. Moore, you must modulate your tones gracefully; let the silver notes
                  ring clear, but soft, melting, flutelike. I am ready and waiting to hear the
                  pleading."</p>
               <p>And Moore did commence; he took the ungloved hand that rested so demurely upon his
                  arm, looked down in the moonlight into the eyes whose light had dazzled him, and
                  his faculties became strangely roused.</p>
               <p>"Witch, syren, enchantress, mocking-fairy—what planet gave you birth?"</p>
               <p>"It is a fine exordium. Pray go on. Your powers are rising. What will not be the
                  peroration? I see a far-reaching prophet glance that will soon pierce to the
                  innermost recesses of our souls, and revel among the mysteries! Your magnificent
                  manliness is showing its glory. What a<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6426-00000060"/>
                  woman worships in man, is his superb strength. Man's most attractive qualities are
                  his dazzling frankness, his supreme daring, his overwhelming——Mr. Moore, exhibit
                  your full mettle—I am all attention!"</p>
               <p>"You see I am patient—changeling, femina semper mutabile!"</p>
               <p>"The appropriate gesture for the <emph>quotation</emph> would be thus," and Mag
                  lifted her hands; "also, an <emph>exclamation</emph> point, thus," and she made a
                  gesture of attention with her forefinger. She had extricated her hand from his
                  clasp, and stood before him, lifting a saucy, daring glance to meet his flashing
                  eye. A host of exclamation and interrogation points radiated from his now blazing
                  eyes, as she went on. She was testing his mettle, but his time would come to put
                  her mettle to the point."</p>
               <p>"Mocking spirit! Goddess or syren born! You are delicious in your earthly charms!
                  Gorgeous beyond our dreams of what is captivating in woman! Your magic is too
                  potent, too bewitching, too bewildering! It rouses the hot blood in my mortal
                  veins—the fever bounds madly through my pulses—the breath of a wild passion is
                  sweeping through my heart, hot and fierce as the blast of the desert. Be wary, be
                  merciful; it shall come to you, sweet as the fragrance of Araby the Blest. My
                     <emph>heart</emph> is hot, bright queen of elfin-land, but my brain is cool as
                  dew. Charmer, charming never so wisely, do not tempt me too far! The wild spirit
                  that glows and fades in your eye, as the stars never fade—that gives your lithe
                  form its willowy grace—that tones your voice with its clear, ringing, bird-music;
                  that wild, free, daring spirit is <emph>passionately</emph> enchanting! Beware!
                  You, too, are mortal!"</p>
               <p>Her eyelids drooped beneath his gaze; a flush mounted to cheek, and lip, and brow.
                  He waited, and watched its fading.</p>
               <p>"My"——! Words of passionate endearment gushed to his lips: he forced them back,
                  but they would not be repressed.</p>
               <p>"My Zoe! My life! Henceforth my Eve in this world-Eden!"</p>
               <p>The music of those low, passion tones, stirred the depths of her being, like a
                  voice of prophecy. The <emph>master</emph> spirit before her, felt his power, and
                  the spell of a triumphant joy wreathed itself in sweet fascination around those
                  proud arched lips, as he went on.</p>
               <p>"<emph>My</emph> Eve! Magdalene Barclay! In the universe there are none but we,
                  to-night! But the night is holy! We are in Eden—our paradise; listen to its soft
                  flowing waters; the goldfish are at play among those sparkling fountains; the
                  wings of angels are rustling among those green, waving trees; there are thornless
                  roses blooming along the pathway; far in the <emph>distance</emph> stands the Tree
                  of Knowledge: we will leave its poisoned fruit forever untasted. Our hearts are
                  young and pure; we will wreathe them with garlands, buds and blossoms from the
                  Tree of Life, and bid them remain forever unstained. This life is most exceeding
                     <emph>sweet,</emph> and Life's life is <emph>love!</emph> My Eve! My Zoe! My
                  Life!"</p>
               <p>He gently laid his hand upon her brow, and claimed her, as the sons of God might
                  have done when they wooed the daughters of men, because they were fair.</p>
               <p>Even then she conquered him again, controlled the fire in his pulses by the might
                  of her womanly nature, its weakness.</p>
               <p>Beneath his glance her lids had fallen. Before those daring fingers had more than
                  caressed the waving hair, soft tear-drops were falling thick and fast, and lay
                  shining like dew at their feet, while her lips quivered with uncontrolled emotion,
                  and the conqueror reined back his fiery passion. The guardian, the protector,
                  gazed down upon those falling tears, a soft glow melted into his passionate eyes,
                  the moon and stars smiled in their far homes, and there was silence. At last he
                  took her passive hand, laid it quietly upon his arm, and they went slowly on their
                  way, a world of emotion, unsubdued, yet holy, lying like restless ocean waves in
                  their souls.</p>
               <p>Magdalene Barclay had met her <emph>master.</emph>
               </p>
               <pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6426-00000061"/>
               <p>There is no luxury to a woman's nature so wild, so enchantingly sweet, so
                  surpassingly delicious, as that of being conquered.</p>
               <p>It is the mystery of her being. The consciousness of strength in woman is not a
                  happy consciousness. The old simile of the oak and the vine is exquisitely
                  truthful. The vine, by its own strength, can never lift itself heavenward. It
                  spends its life, creeping and grovelling upon the earth, till it finds a superior
                  in strength to raise and guide it sunward. If, by mischance, its tendrils wind
                  themselves clingingly around some grovelling thing, it lies degraded in the dust
                  forever.</p>
               <p>Strength in woman is usually a sad and dangerous gift. A sad and unnatural state
                  of things develops that strength.</p>
               <p>Woman was not made to live alone. Society is not so constituted as to permit her
                  to do it safely. Eve was made for Adam, out of Adam—a part of his life—his
                  help-mate. It is then fitting and beautiful that she should yield her strength to
                  the guidance of a stronger spirit; it is in the harmony—in the constitution of
                  things. Strength in woman too, is a dangerous gift—the development of evil and
                  sorrow on earth.</p>
               <p>It should be guarded, for it has its charm. It is like a plant whose fragrance may
                  be sweet with poison—whose harvest may be misery.</p>
               <p>Magdalene Barclay, in much solitude, had grown strong. Now the womanly nature
                  sprang forth, Minerva-like, from the intellect, in all its panoply and armor, and
                  knelt in grateful homage to the deity who called it forth.</p>
               <p>For one hour she gave herself up, unconsciously, to the pure bliss of love's young
                  passion-dream. For one hour the emotions of youth in their ripe fullness and
                  luxuriance, went careering, healthful, pure and free, through the soul. Life was
                     <emph>young</emph> with the dreamers. For one hour, in their hearts, a pean
                  came swelling as if the immortal gods had crowned them with gifts and honors. For
                  one hour earth became heaven to them.</p>
               <p>Taylor, in "The Physical Theory of Another Life," imagines that the soul may yet
                  be clothed with a body capable of bearing a happiness so intense that the life of
                  a thousand years may be concentrated into one hour. The fire of joy on earth
                  exhausts the intellect and spirit inclosed in the earthly frame, and it wearies of
                  its own joy. The immortal life, imprisoned in clay, often ravishes the tenement of
                  flesh. It makes fearful ravage of its prison house, and then itself bears untold
                  tortures. The free, daring spirit, born of heaven and destined for immortality,
                  must be fettered and controlled on earth, as old King Eolus of the myth governed
                  the spirits in his charge, keeping them in prison and in chains, under the weight
                  of mountains, and knowing when to give loose reins—"laxas habenas."</p>
               <p>Experience is a tyrant teacher.</p>
               <p>D'Israeli says: "The genealogy of experience is brief, experience is the child of
                  thought, and thought is the child of action. It is when we have acted ourselves
                  and seen others act; it is when we have labored ourselves under the influence of
                  our passions, and seen others laboring; it is when our great hopes have been
                  attained, or have been balked; it is when, after having the human heart revealed
                  to us, we have the first opportunity to think; it is then, if we can think, that
                  the whole truth lights upon us; it is then that the sayings of sages and the
                  warnings of prophets are explained and understood; it is then that we gain
                  experience. He whose courage has been put to the test, who has relied on the love,
                  or suffered by the hate, of woman, who has been deceived by man, and has
                     <emph>deceived himself,</emph> may have as much knowledge of the world at
                  twenty, as if he had lived a century."</p>
               <p>"Will you stay with me a few moments at the doorsteps, my whip-poor-will? I have
                  many things to say to you. While the moon and stars are shining so calmly up
                  yonder, let us as calmly talk with destiny. 'There is a divinity that shapes our
                  ends.' Look up into my<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6426-00000062"/> eyes, bird of
                  night. Let me see full and clear the soul twin to mine, molded in my
                  likeness."</p>
               <p>But Mag could not raise her eyes—some spell was forcing down the lids.</p>
               <p>"Your spirit must be all mine! I have taken possession of it for my own forever—it
                  must give itself to me in full control. You must not <emph>fear</emph> me—you must
                  not <emph>doubt</emph> me now—you must <emph>trust</emph> me entirely, my child,
                  for I am worthy."</p>
               <p>The silver syllabled music from those arched lips fell into her heart of hearts in
                  tremulous harmony.</p>
               <p>"I know that your finely organized nature has made you conscious, by its subtle
                  instincts, that you are in the presence of your destiny. Do not fear it, Magdalene
                  Barclay. Let us look bravely and hopefully to the future. We who, in our youth,
                  have solved some of the rarest mysteries of the soul in the flesh, should dare to
                  front the future, and work out a destiny more noble than less gifted souls. Yes,
                  you are a gifted being, Magdalene. God never endowed a nobler woman! You have a
                  strong, free spirit; it can bear to learn truth—even painful truths concerning its
                  own nature, for <emph>truth's</emph> sake alone. Let us understand each other now,
                  Zoe of a new Eden."</p>
               <p>"Go on, Charles Moore, I am listening."</p>
               <p>She lifted those timid and trembling lashes now, and in the restless eyes he
                  fathomed eloquent meanings.</p>
               <p>"God has placed in our care, Magdalene, the materials for our life-work. He has
                  made us the arbiters of our own fate, the framers of our own destiny. The sculptor
                  who chisels his statue from the Parian marble will embody his conceptions with
                  more perfect beauty than he whose material is only the rugged mountain granite. To
                  you belong endowments rare and royal as the Parian marble. You can make your soul
                  of noble symmetry, of exquisite proportions, of divine loveliness. God has
                  appointed this for your lifework, Magdalene Barclay. My Eve must not
                     <emph>dare</emph> to slight her God-appointed work."</p>
               <p>Again the desire to clasp her to his heart was battled down. He bit his passionate
                  lips to control their longing for hers, that were so tremulous, as he went on. Her
                  lids were quivering with tears—she choked down her emotion.</p>
               <p>"Go on, Charles Moore, I'm listening."</p>
               <p>"Let me say yet more than this, because I say it to one who is to be forever
                  dearer to me than my own life. As my Zoe cultivates herself, she will find that
                  there are many flaws in the marble, which may mar the grace of the statue she is
                  forming; it will never be perfect like her ideal. She has great strength of mind
                  and soul, but it is womanly strength, and the charm of her nature is not its
                  strength. Her ideal, her model is a being of grace, of gentleness, of goodness, of
                  most fascinating loveliness, meekness, purity. She must not copy even an Apollo
                  Belvidere; that is not a woman's task. Her model must be a creature less than
                  Minerva, more than Venus, more than even the earthly Madonna."</p>
               <p>And here the perverse, morbid spirit of Mag rose again to full life. For an hour
                  it had remained dormant, couchant, lulled by the master. It rose from its slumber
                  and took charge of its own again.</p>
               <p>"And now, Sir Prophet, a page from your fated Future. You are the strong and
                  cunning workman, who dares mark out a bold, high, fearless destiny. You will take

                  of matchless splendor and strength, under whose bountiful shadow my ideal of grace
                  and beauty may find harmonious shelter. Oh, bold dreamer! What if I do not accept
                  you as master, prophet or high-priest? What if I tell you that I, too, have
                  watched the stars in their courses before this night of revelation—that I, too,
                  have seen visions, and dreamed dreams."</p>
               <p>"Go on, Magdalene, my heart is listening."</p>
               <p>She went on, her spirit insane with its morbid pride.</p>
               <p>"What if I tell you that I have found concealed in my nature, elements of
                  darkness, doubting, and disease of<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6426-00000063"/>

                  me a <emph>skeptic</emph>—that I doubt human goodness—I doubt myself—I doubt the
                  possibility of anything divine in religion, to redeem humanity. I <emph>doubt you,
                     Charles Atherton Moore,</emph> while I worship you! What if I tell you that I
                  will never permit the curse of evil in my nature to come upon you! What if I exert
                  my will to free myself from the power of your spirit, which has charmed me,
                  perhaps, with a serpent charm."</p>
               <p>"Go on Magdalene Barclay, your good angel is listening."</p>
               <p>"Yes, your soul has made this night delicious to me; but the night will pass, and
                  neither Time nor Eternity will ever bring to us its likeness. But let us not
                  regret its experiences; they have purified and strengthened me, and I bless you.
                  It has been a night of revelation, of apocalyptic vision to me! God grant it may
                  bring unmingled blessings to you! To your innermost soul may it also be, as to
                  mine, a purification and inspiration."</p>
               <p>A glorious spirit lighted up every lineament of her face, till it blazed in
                  beauty. She took his hand in hers; with a timid, graceful gesture knelt a moment
                  at his feet, touched her lips to the fingers that clasped hers; and when, at last,
                  Charles Moore would have caught her to his heart, and kissed her eyes, and hair,
                  and brow, and lips, she had glided from him. She paused one moment before she
                  passed from his sight, to take a last look of the man made in the image of God,
                  who might have come between her and God, and a prayer gushed from her lips, "May
                  God bless you! May God forever bless you."</p>
               <p>While the prayer ascended, and the burning blessing was falling from her lips upon
                  his heart, he found himself alone.</p>

               <p>"GATES of Paradise closed against me, and the angel <emph>within,</emph>" said
                  Charles Atherton Moore to himself, as he found himself alone in the enchanting
                  moonlight. "A discomfited hero, knocking for admission, when the golden hinges
                  have swung back in his face! Courage means having <emph>heart</emph>—means risking
                  a thousand chances for defeat and death, against one chance for life and glory.
                  Motto for a soldier, in all undertakings with men and maidens.—Conquer or die, and
                  die fighting."</p>
               <p>"By Jupiter! That was a magnificent finale! a splendid piece of
                     <emph>acting</emph>—if it was <emph>Art!</emph> The play is by no manner of

                  evil"——</p>
               <p>Moore continued his reverie as he walked home to Frank.</p>
               <p>He saw Mag for a moment the next morning; she was feeding the canaries under the
                  locusts, as he and Frank passed, on their way to the depot. Moore bounded from the
                  buggy as he caught a glimpse of her</p>
               <p>"Magdalene Barclay, what am I to think of you? What under heaven did you mean last
                  night?"</p>
               <p>"I meant what I said, Mr. Moore."</p>
               <p>"May I write to you, now?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir." It was said sadly.</p>
               <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6426-00000064"/>
               <p>"That is wrong in you. But you will remember me, Magdalene?"</p>
               <p>"Till I die, and forever afterward, <emph>if permitted.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"And remember, I shall love you until then! But Frank is impatient, and I must
                  force myself away. I would stay to persuade you to write to me, but I cannot. God
                  bless you! God be with you!"</p>
               <p>He was gone, and she worshipped her ideal of him.</p>
               <p>And how had she spent the night after those heart revelations? By the time she had
                  reached her room, the nerves that a burning passion had strung to their utmost
                  tension, gave way. She threw herself upon her couch, in perfect abandon, and lay
                  panting for breath, and wishing—mad, silly thing that she was—wishing that she was
                     <emph>safe</emph> in her grave!—poor, proud child.</p>
               <p>All night long she lay there, sleepless and tearless, as if burying her face in
                  dust and degradation could crucify and redeem her morbid pride. The trial hour had
                  come to test her life-culture. Disease may lie latent for years in the system,
                  till some new atmosphere reveals its dormant power; then it awakes to life and
                  feeds upon the vitals. The disease of Mag's spirit roused itself to full action.
                  Yes, she had brooded over her orphanage; she had been taught continually that she
                  was unlike her kind; aye, and she felt it in her inmost soul. She considered
                  herself a waif upon a desert ocean—that sweet human love was not for her. She
                  would never curse one so God-like, with the gift of her outcast life; she would
                  never mar her idol with aught so wayward and passion-tainted, as the heart that
                  lay throbbing, as if in its death-throes, in her bosom! Sweet, silly fool! But
                  when did a woman ever know her own heart? When was love ever consistent? What
                  woman could ever account to herself for the vagaries of her own nature? Mag was
                  coquetting, but she never dreamed it. She had persuaded herself that she was
                     <emph>giving up</emph> a glorious human love! When did a woman ever know
                  herself as a coquette? Mag was self-deceived, when she said to herself, that she
                  would not degrade her prince, by placing as his crown jewel, a gem unworthy the
                  coronet. All this meant that she considered herself a beggared queen; that her
                  royal garments were trailing in the dust; that she longed, herself, to be
                  worshipped. She convinced herself that she had <emph>given up</emph> his love,
                  when she was merely wooing a deeper adoration. Poor, silly Mag! Yet her ideal love
                  was <emph>pure;</emph> a pure woman's ideal is a gorgeous thing, and dazzles in
                  its very radiance of purity and sacrifice. Mag spent the livelong night in
                  deceiving herself, and morning found her with a dim eye and convulsed lip; then
                  she crushed down the rebellion of pride and passion, and fettered her chafing
                  spirit; but the heart of the girl of seventeen, had blossomed into full womanhood
                  in a single night.</p>
               <p>She was a school-girl still, deep in researches of the classics. She had
                     <emph>given up</emph> Charles Moore! Yet in the pages "de Amicitia" she saw his
                  eyes looking up, and they became in truth, as she had promised him, an
                  inspiration. <emph>Given up</emph> Charles Moore! Yet while in the Ars Poetica,
                  she found <title>Moore's Melodies</title> a sweeter poetry than aught else in the
                  universe. Her memory lingered on his low passion tones. She whispered the sweetest
                  phrases to her heart again and again, "My Eve, my Zoe;" and again and again her
                  heart responded that it was all music, delicious music! She had <emph>given
                     up</emph> Charles Moore! Sweet simpleton! His eyes looked up from the pages of
                  old Homer, and when she repeated it to herself, a little mocking, merry spirit,
                  over her right shoulder, burst into 'inextinguishable laughter.'</p>
               <p>Frank brought her the pages of the wise and good men of ages, and the thought of
                  Charles Moore was associated with all that was good, and great, and eloquent.
                  Carlyle's clarion tones resounded through her soul, but not <emph>alone</emph> was
                  she when she listened to the strange, inspiring music. She said to herself that
                  she, too, had passed from the "everlasting no" to the "centre of indifference,"
                  that the "everlasting yea" was as yet to her unborn—and again, the<pb n="128-129"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000065"/> mocking spirit over her shoulder turned away to
                  laugh at her sublime heroic folly. She learned from Emerson, to "set her habits to
                  a life of <emph>solitude,</emph> to have her glees and glooms <emph>alone,</emph>
                  to embrace <emph>solitude</emph> as a bride—to make her own measure estimate
                  enough, her own praise reward enough for her." Yet was she <emph>never
                     alone,</emph> and that was the delight of her solitude. Remembered music tones
                  haunted it, remembered smiles shone on her from the pages, remembered glances
                  quivered down into her heart, till its strings thrilled to the vital depths; the
                  thought of him became to her as she had promised him, an inspiration; he had
                  awakened her deep nature. In this Mag was fortunate. Few women ever find the
                  master hand that can reach the deep chords; few souls live the deep lives of which
                  their slumbering faculties are capable. The thought of him became also a
                  purification. For him she kept herself precious; for him she guarded every
                  thought, and word, and action; for him she studied an earnest self-culture, nobler
                  than Goethe's, for she kept herself pure. Goethe made self-culture his God; she
                  made her <emph>ideal</emph> of Charles Moore her God, and convinced herself that
                  she had <emph>given him up!</emph> Love is a precious madness! and Mag Barclay was
                  possessed by the wild spirit. It was a part of her life-development, as it is of
                  every woman's, for <emph>woman was born for love.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>So the months rolled on, and this was her education.</p>
               <p>Frank walked in upon Min and Mag one afternoon, as they were busy at their
                  drawing. Min was at work upon a marvellous "Castle by the Sea." Mag was trying the
                  effect of light and shadow in strong contrast, on the "Dungeon of Chillon;" the
                  light streaming in a rift through the barred window, upon the "seven pillars of
                  Gothic mold," was quite effective, and Frank tipped his hat to it, with a low
                  obeisance.</p>
               <p>"I bow to the magic and majesty of genius!" said he; "and, Cousin Min, I have some
                  news for you! great news! astonishing news! news of wonderful victory! Mag has
                  committed <emph>immortality!</emph>" Frank unrolled a newspaper from his
                  coat-pocket with great display. "If this document doesn't go through the bones and
                  marrow of a cousin of mine at West Point, then his bones and marrow need
                     <emph>repairing.</emph> This perpetration, for a girl of seventeen, is
                  decidedly good! Just listen!" And Frank read with great unction and fervor—after
                  commenting—</p>
               <p>"To think Mag would dare commit anything so sentimental as this
                     <emph>Farewell!</emph> It is alarmingly pious, especially at the
                     <emph>close,</emph> where piety is most appropriate. The first stanza is lame a
                  little, but she hadn't raised the spirit well; it goes easier after you get into
                  it some; she had to get used to the rhymes, and they cramped her at first. She
                     <emph>heads</emph> it, 'To my Brother,' as if she ever had so much as the
                  shadow of a brother on the top of this round earth. But we can
                     <emph>suppose</emph> an article of that sort, say thus, 'To Lieutenant Charles
                  Moore, West Point, my sweetheart.' I have already sent that gentleman a copy, with
                  full explanations, of all the points that were aimed at him."</p>
               <p>"You have?" exclaimed Mag in indignation.</p>
               <p>"Yes, little tiger-pussy; <emph>I have,</emph> and you may help yourself the very
                  best way you think proper."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir; that very thing I shall do!" and Mag closed her lips in a very
                  determined fashion.</p>
               <p>"Fire-birds and wild-cats!" ejaculated Frank.</p>
               <p>"But please be so accommodating as to enlighten me on the subject," Min said; "I
                  have not discovered the astonishing part yet. Don't tantalize me by keeping me in
                  such distressing ignorance."</p>
               <p>"You must be in agony, Min! I'll relieve it!" and Frank read—</p>

               <p>"Well, Mag, what are you going to do about my sending it to Charlie, with notes to
                  show the points? That idea of waiting till you are through the troubles of this
                  life is unique. The last line is emphatic, you see. I told Charlie I was sorry for
                  him, to be obliged to defer his hopes to t'other world. It would take a deal of
                  patience for a fellow to wait, one not being sure of that world, anyhow. What are
                  you going to do about it?"</p>
               <p>"Never mind; it won't concern you!"</p>
               <p>"I'll wager my head, Min, that she'll do something astonishing—crucify him, and
                  herself, too—tear herself into inch pieces, and send herself tee-totally used up
                  on the heels of that effusion."</p>
               <p>"That very thing I'll do; and you may glorify over it."</p>
               <p>"I'll do it till I'm blue, Mag! And I'll flood Charlie—poor fellow—with love and
                  literature as long as yours is in the market; so don't hurt yourself, pussy!"</p>
               <p>Frank caressed the dark brown hair with saucy, but soothing fingers, as he stood
                  looking over her drawing.</p>
               <p>A few weeks after this, he came upon them again, at Glenlyn Falls, where they had
                  strayed. He greeted Min in his own style:</p>
               <p>"I told you she would do it, Min! Don't she love him with a vengeance? Killed two
                  birds with one stone, so they'll never flutter, but set the whole village in a
                  flutteration, especially such birds as Josie Newton. Mag! Mag! I believe the Old
                  Nick has possessed you, certain; and I'm not alone in my opinion!"</p>
               <p>"Well, Frank, free your mind <emph>once,</emph> do—it will do you good; you'll
                  feel better after it."</p>
               <p>"It is <emph>double and twisted immortality</emph> this time, Min!" And Frank
                  produced the article. "Here is the affair that has made such havoc among the
                  birds, and set the village gossips, and even the minister, by the ears. Josie and
                  the minister sympathize over it; it put them both into such ecstasies that I
                  thought there might be a necessity of sending for a doctor for Josie. I began to
                  feel uneasy for her health. She said Mr. Brown declared this was the most
                  truthful, yet witty effusion that he ever read—the best he ever saw; a master mind
                  had done it, and Miss Barclay had deserved to have the vanity and nonsense taken
                  out of her long ago. It was a scathing criticism, but it would do her good—she
                  deserved every word of it."</p>
               <pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6426-00000067"/>
               <p>"That will do for a prelude. Now let us have the thing itself."</p>
               <p>"Directly, Min. Josie said, too, that Mr. Brown had told her, in
                     <emph>confidence,</emph> as a great <emph>secret,</emph> that he had always
                  known that Mag was both <emph>insane</emph> and a <emph>skeptic.</emph> It had
                  really troubled him o' nights. He had not mentioned it publicly, for fear of
                  injuring Mag! How could you so disturb his <emph>peace</emph> of mind, Mag?"</p>
               <p>"It was only a small <emph>piece,</emph> Frank, that was disturbed."</p>
               <p>"Worse and worse. He disliked to have Mag teacher in his Sunday School, on account
                  of her skepticism. Why, Mag, what does it all mean? You've walked over him quite
                  too emphatically sometime."</p>
               <p>"I haven't one iota of <emph>faith in him,</emph> and he knows it. That is the
                  solution of the skepticism."</p>
               <p>"Of course—of course—I understand that. But you see, Mag, you'll have to take Aunt
                  Lina's advice: 'Better get the good will of a dog than the ill will.' You must
                  contrive to pat him on his head a little—feed him with sugarplums, and all that
                  sort of thing—stop his mouth some way, it will never do in the world! And you must
                  set your wits to smooth down all the feathers you have ruffled around town."</p>
               <p>"Now, Frank, I'm impatient!" said Min.</p>
               <p>"The document is anonymous—or, rather, it is signed 'Steele,' and it is certainly
                  a <emph>cutting</emph> affair on the rhyme I read the other day. Mag, you'd better
                  ask him to cut you a rope off the equinoctial line, and go straight and hang
                  yourself on the north pole, as being the nearest pole of this little earth."</p>
               <p>"Please hush your remarks, and read, Frank," said Min. Frank read the whole
                  article. We give only the part that concerned Magdalene Barclay:</p>
               <p>"We would advise Magdalene, the authoress of the pathetic 'Farewell,' in last
                  week's paper, not to hang her <emph>heart</emph> on the willows in that fashion,
                  and not to use so much egotism in her effusions. There are dark corners in every
                  one's life; but people in general are wise enough to keep them and their vanity
                  veiled. Magdalene is no veiled lady. Every son of Adam can read her 'open
                  secrets'—can see, with half an eye, to the centre of her soul. We would entreat
                  her, for her own sake, not to write such sublimated nonsense. We would like coolly
                  to dissect with her the splendid fanfaronade of that 'Farewell,' to her 'brother,
                  and see what stuff it is really made of. Now, Magdalene, let us take the first
                  line: <q>
                     <l>"'I bring no bud or leaf from memory's shrine.'</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"Of course you don't, my dear lady. A 'shrine' is no place for 'buds and leaves.'
                  They grow in gardens and greenhouses, and several other places where
                     <emph>nature</emph> puts them besides, but never on 'shrines.' However, that is
                  a magnanimous resolve of yours, to 'remember your brother,' 'though all that
                     <emph>links your name to his</emph> should be forgot!' It means, we suppose,
                  that you intend to be amiable to him, even when he gives you the cold shoulder,
                  and cuts your acquaintance.</p>
               <p>"You are a good child for that resolve, Magdalene—it shows that you have been
                  rightly brought up. We hope you will stick to that, with all the world, when it
                  frowns on you, or even laughs at you. It is the germ of all Bible religion, and we
                  can fancy that some good grandmother taught it you with her spectacles over her
                  eyes.</p>
               <p>"We hope it don't mean that you will remember him when you are <emph>cross.</emph>
                  We think it don't, from the <emph>kind</emph> things you say of your brother.</p>
               <p>"We gather one interesting item of information about him—he is a good performer on
                  the <emph>violin.</emph> Yes, fiddling is an agreeable and praiseworthy
                  accomplishment for young men who can find no other outlet to their genius. But you
                  speak of 'strings' across your 'deep soul,' on which he performs. Well, if you
                  choose to 'string' up your soul as a fiddle for him, no one can possibly have any
                  objections—it is a free country—there is no disputing about <emph>tastes</emph>
                     here—<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6426-00000068"/> American citizens have a right
                  to their tastes as well as opinions; but we would advise you, as a friend, not to
                  tell everybody of your tastes about those violin performances.</p>
               <p>"You put yourself and brother in the category of <emph>fast</emph> people. What
                  else can this line mean? <q>
                     <l>"'Our life of moments counted long, full years.'</l>
                  </q> Do you mean that you consider yourself one of Mr. Butler's Flora McFlimsey
                  species, and your brother ahead of the times? And, too, he wears a 'seal upon his
                  brow.' We have read <emph>before</emph> of a 'beast with a seal upon his
                  forehead.' We wonder if he was troubled with a pressure of ideas—if so, if they
                  were <emph>new</emph> ones, or only fossil remains—preserved specimenshanded 'down
                  from former generations.' And <emph>your</emph> heart, too, 'bore the tracery of
                  tears.' Can you enlighten us a little further with regard to that phenomenon? Do
                  you mean to insinuate that you have eyes weeping in your heart day and night,
                  daughter of the people? Or do you merely mean that you have a <emph>heart of
                     rock,</emph> of the geological formation that abounds in <emph>ripple
                     marks?</emph> The next lines give us a most astounding piece of information!
                  What possesses you to keep such inhabitants in your bosom? What under heavens do

                  </q> No? Well, it was kind not to wake the old serpent in you! But what about the
                  monster? It is difficult to understand. Do you keep a Cerberus to guard those
                  'deep places'—the lower regions of your soul—and feed him with 'sops,' to keep him
                  sleeping? Did your brother slip by without waking him, even by his fiddle? Or do
                  you mean that it is a bona fide snake in your stomach? Why, it is dangerous! We
                  don't wonder at your 'fevered heart.' We should expect 'convulsions.' Your brother
                  was a compassionate soul, when he 'bade those dreams depart part' that were about
                  to 'wake the passion fiend' that lay 'coiled upon your heart.'</p>
               <p>"And, Magdalene, you have boasted that it was your '<emph>glory</emph>' that you

                  it completely riddled, and it will not be the world's fault, but your own. The
                  world is bad enough—though a very good world in its place when properly
                  managed—and you should make the most of it, and the best of it. It laughs at you
                  now—but let those laugh who win. When you have conquered it, you may turn the

               <p>"That is what I call censorious," said Min.</p>

               <p>"Mag," said Frank, "I've a proposition to make. I think you would rival Paine and
                  Voltaire in riddling the psalms and prophets. Suppose you try yourself on the
                  Nineteenth Psalm. Paine considers that the only one worth reading; the rest are

                  ridiculing things sacred to <emph>any one.</emph> Even if the Bible is a grand
                  lie, no more harm in believing it than in disbelieving it."</p>
               <p>"And I believe that the education we <emph>Puritans</emph> receive from the Bible,
                  whether true or false, is the noblest education in religion that humanity is
                  capable of receiving. All that is good and noble in our life-culture may be
                  traced, directly or indirectly, to the influences of the Bible," said Frank,
                  quoting from a letter said to be Franklin's answer to Paine.</p>
               <p>"I met a Deist the other day, who told me he would swear the Bible was a lie, and
                  the only God for worship was Truth. I told him his ideal God was distant, lofty
                  and cold—a double-faced statue, whose lineaments no one could trace. I could not
                  worship as an ideal even a marble Apollo; and his God to me seemed colder than
                  marble. My ideal was the Man God, even if but the myth Strauss represents him. If
                  the Bible was a lie, yet our natures were so constructed they demanded some God
                  for worship. We each had a right to choose our ideal God. My ideal was like the
                  'Christ of History'—the 'Great Teacher,' who loved man the <emph>more</emph> for
                  his temptations and passionate love-longings for purity. No harm could come of my
                  worshipping such an ideal under <emph>any circumstances,</emph> even if the Bible
                  was as false as it represents its own 'Prince of Darkness.'"</p>
               <p>Mag was getting tremendously in earnest.</p>
               <p>"Nature would be false to herself to create demands without providing to satisfy
                  them," responded Frank, "and our consciousness teaches, past all denial, that we
                     <emph>hunger</emph> for a God whom we <emph>must</emph> adore for his
                  perfections, and love because he loves us."</p>
               <p>"Let us go home," said Min. "You are getting too precocious for comfort! What will
                  the world come to if such youngsters as you talk after that fashion?"</p>

               <p>"THIS is a deliciously stupid world! Let any one deny it who dare!" pronounced
                  Charles Atherton Moore, one summer day, to his comrade, Guy Erwin. The two
                  southern bloods were luxuriating in Encampment life—a deal wiser than cadets
                  usually get to be—luxuriating with almost a miraculous amount of philosophy,
                  cigars, and other arrangements. The speaker's head was thrown back for
                  repose—reminding one of an Apollo putting on steam—his feet elevated to an angle
                  of forty-five degrees from the horizon.</p>
               <p>Charlie Moore was an uncommon genius, for a cadet; had absorbed an unusual amount
                  of world and book philosophy with his military education, and the philosophy came
                  in gusts, whiffs and puffs, like the smoke from his cigar. To his profound
                  proposition Guy made answer only by humming an old student song that he learnt at
                  the University, before he was so unfortunate as to be elected a member of the
                  Military Academy—"Gaudeamus igitur!"</p>
               <p>"There is floating in its atmosphere an infinite supply of sublimated

                  of ages in the eternity preceding the present—who knows?" Moore watched the rings
                  of smoke as they slowly rose and suggestively dissolved in air. Erwin sung the
                  University song of Psi Upsilon: <q>

               <p>"Philosopher and fool," continued Charlie, dissolving into the heroic—he had just
                  been reading Kingsley—"man and maiden; for the damsels of these days, also, dive
                  into the metaphysical; here they all whirl together in a<pb n="138-139"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000070"/> sort of merry-go-round, which they style the
                  'Search after Truth.'"</p>
               <p>"Vive, vive, vive l'Amour! Vive la Compagnie!" Erwin replied. "The truth that I've
                  searched for and never found is <emph>woman's truth.</emph> The one subject on
                  which my faith is wanting is a woman's strength and purity. Whited sepulchres are
                  they all, full of all manner of uncleanness and dead men's bones. And yet the
                  frail <emph>beauties!</emph> What a goodly outside falsehood hath, as Shakspeare
                  so very appropriately remarks."</p>
               <p>"I forgive your slander on the sex, Erwin, because you have neither mother nor
                  sister—I have both, thank God."</p>
               <p>"Sister? No; but I adopted one in Virginia last summer, and must tell you what
                  came of it. Rare creature she was, Charlie; soft, still, blue, liquid eyes, calm
                  as the waters of a lake in shadows; hair softer and sunnier than her eyes;
                  magnificent figure, bust, and so forth. She took compassion on my sisterless
                  condition and offered to fill that vacuum in my pericardium, called me 'Brother
                  Guy,' in soft, arch, lisping tones, and taught me to call her 'Sister Ernestine;'
                  she might have been called Madonna, for she had a face like our dreams of the
                  Virgin Mother."</p>
               <p>"You are growing pathetic, Guy."</p>
               <p>"I told you that I rode in the tournament last vacation; I was dolt enough to
                  practise with the lance, night and day, and put Blackhawk in splendid training for
                  the occasion, because she had laughingly hinted that I might win the prize for
                  her—a set of diamonds; she was fond of diamonds. I told her that she was the belle
                  of the States—she should be the queen of the tournament—the sweet, 'White Rose of
                  all the World.'"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"You should have seen me, Charlie; my devotion, as I knelt for her to fasten my
                  plumes, before I rode into the lists. <emph>Ancient</emph> chivalry could not
                  compare with my whispered adoration. And then the royal condescension with which
                  she did her part; the ineffable smile that coquetted over her ravishing lips. But
                  she told me with <emph>such</emph> a woman's glance, that I was <emph>such</emph>
                  a fool to ride; and I made <emph>such</emph> a fool answer, Charlie—that
                     <emph>her</emph> will was my law; she had but to express the slightest wish
                  forbidding me, and her servant would <emph>obey.</emph> She told me to go on and
                     <emph>finish my folly,</emph> and I did!"</p>
               <p>"Of course," whiffed Charlie.</p>
               <p>"I was sure of the diamonds, and so was she; but Black-hawk, in the last trial,
                  deceived me, and I lost. Instead of the diamonds, I was goat enough to lay at her
                  feet the plumes and sash, telling her that I was grieved beyond expression,
                  because they were disgraced."</p>
               <p>"And the key to all?"</p>
               <p>"She had called me 'brother' to get the diamonds and play the queen of the
                  tournament. I was sure of the honors, and so was she; but she could not force her
                  heart to forgive me for her disappointment. Hard, wasn't it, Charlie?"</p>
               <p>"So you curse the sex for that folly?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no! She forgave me at last, and I devoted myself to her as a true knight and
                  man; was groomsman at her wedding, because I <emph>could</emph> not claim that
                  nearer place. Hey, Charlie?"</p>
               <p>"It did require a spirit of resignation."</p>
               <p>"Yes. I had found some Utopian ideas in the Bible, which I put in practice, thus:
                  'Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.' For want of any better
                  philosophy, I tried that, and found it a great success."</p>
               <p>"Christianity is the most politic religion in the world, especially at times."</p>
               <p>"But it is unfortunate for fine-looking Christians like you and me, Charlie, that
                  our physical beauty attracts the <emph>frailest</emph> of the sex. Oh, I have had
                  heavenly knowledge! There are angels of light, members of Christ's church, whom
                  men know to be"——</p>
               <p>"Hush! for God's sake, hush, Erwin! I have a mother and sister—you have had a
                  mother—for their sakes spare the sex! You will have faith in them before the end
                  comes. To the pure, all things are pure."</p>
               <p>"Forgive me, Charlie; the truth should not <emph>all</emph> be spoken or written.
                  The pure must go on their way, spotless, never dreaming of what we
                     <emph>know</emph> to be truth. They must, perchance, be thrown out
                     <emph>alone</emph> into the world, ignorant that at any step they may meet
                  devils clothed in saints' garments, to lure them to perdition. No, I must not
                  offend chaste ears with such truth."</p>
               <p>"Look for truth with me, Guy; God's truth; not truth in man or woman."</p>
               <p>"Truth! truth! What is truth?"</p>
               <p>"Pilate asked that question of the Man-God, and Bacon says it is a significant
                  fact that he did not wait for a reply.<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6426-00000071"/>
                  The '<emph>Great</emph> Teacher' gave silence as his only answer, but Carlyle says
                     <emph>Silence</emph> is eloquence."</p>
               <p>The two military philosophers puffed clouds of smoke, to make the question less
                  obscure; but when the graceful cloud-wreaths had rolled slowly away, there was no
                  essential enlightenment to the understanding.</p>
               <p>"What is Truth?" said Moore, soaring again after the clouds.</p>
               <p>"Philosophers and magi of all ages have joined in the search for her. One man
                  raises the cry 'Eureka!—eureka!'—'I have found it! I have found Truth!' Yes, he
                  has found her in a vicious circle, and followed her around, treading again and
                  again upon his own footsteps, taking the <emph>conclusion</emph> he wishes at
                  last, 'vi et armis,' or as my horse Grey Eagle takes the bits in his teeth, and
                  follows the path that he desires. And the rabble watch him in wide-mouthed wonder,
                  and swallow his precious balderdash and adore him as an inspired priest or prophet
                  of Truth."</p>
               <p>"Go on, Charlie, our search will be encouraging."</p>
               <p>"So Socrates found Truth. He followed her by the way of
                  <emph>self</emph>-knowledge, and Plato followed in his footsteps, discoursing
                  luminously on the distinctions of <emph>ideas</emph> and <emph>opinions</emph>
                  concerning <emph>Truth.</emph> The Stoics took the path of
                  <emph>self</emph>-discipline, the Epicureans of <emph>self</emph>-luxury, the
                  Idealists of the dictum, 'Cogito ergo sum,' of their master, '<emph>I</emph>
                  think, therefore, <emph>I</emph> am.' Kant made great and wonderful discoveries in
                  the path where the search for Truth led him. <emph>Reason</emph> could not span
                  Truth! but in the <emph>will</emph> of man lay the ability of comprehending it;
                  the finite will, by its infinite energy, unfolding until it grasped the infinite,
                  begging the question we desire proved—the infinite capacity of the will!"</p>
               <p>"Where do you purpose that our search commence?"</p>
               <p>"Truth has been discovered so often, hiding herself in such strange places, that
                  we are tempted to think her merely a coquettish, double-faced jade, who smiles
                  most bewitchingly upon us when we invite her caresses, until we, deeming that we
                  have won her <emph>all our own forever,</emph> enchanted with her favors, and
                  worshipping her matchless loveliness, proud as Lucifer, are going forth
                  light-bearers to the world! When lo! we discover that our double-faced mistress,
                  'on whose love our lavish hearts would spend themselves,' has been smiling
                  constantly with the same bewildering wildering sweetness upon our rivals, inviting
                  them to her ravishing regards, as fondly as ourselves."</p>
               <p>"Coming to earth again, Charlie, I see form and comeliness in this last tirade.
                  Some of it is within my comprehension. You've been up into the seventh sphere,
                  which I haven't attained yet! But what in the name of the miraculous has taken
                  possession of you? Been crossed in love any way, and taken a dose of philosophy as
                  an antidote? Granting that there is a <emph>cause</emph> for everything (some
                  except the first cause as causeless, and reason, that if the first cause is
                  causeless, then all things may be causeless, but we will deny that; we will grant
                  that the first cause is causeless, but it is the cause of all other causes), I
                  will venture to inquire the cause of the birth of the philosophic explosion which
                  has just thundered in my ears."</p>
               <p>Charlie rose, gave a mighty yawn, looked at Erwin with a very expressive and
                  peculiar glance, lighted another cigar, and resumed. "Yes, Guy, denying the
                  hypothesis of human and superhuman existence, the mortality of flesh, and the
                  immortality of the soul, and of the Absolute itself, all of which is beyond
                     <emph>proof,</emph> and in which we believe, by the workings of a
                     <emph>law</emph>—the fundamental <emph>law</emph> of human belief, <emph>common
                     sense</emph> (<foreign xml:lang="LAT">vide</foreign> Reid, Stewart, Brown,
                  Hamilton, and so forth). Denying all this, there <emph>seems</emph> to exist a
                  most magnificently, charming <emph>feminine illusion.</emph> I <emph>have
                     faith</emph> in the existence of the <emph>illusion.</emph> Paul, the Christian
                  philosopher, says that faith is the evidence of the <emph>unknown.</emph> I cannot
                     <emph>prove</emph> the existence of my illusion, but I have <emph>faith</emph>
                  in it."</p>
               <p>"Let me feel your pulse, Moore—steady, old boy—steady."</p>
               <p>"Taking the evidence of the <emph>supposed</emph> senses, there has dawned upon me
                  a specimen of supposed flesh and blood, a beautiful and attractive illusion,
                  fascinating with other rich, volatile, foam-like, sparkling illusions of humor,
                  wit, poetry, and philosophy—full of that vitality and spirituality, that a
                  supposed female soul may acquire in the course of seventeen supposed years of
                  supposed cultivation on this supposed earthly sphere."</p>
               <p>"Take my hat, Charlie! Hobbes says, 'Thought is a compound of sensations,' I'll
                  testify it is a perfect conglomeration of sensations."</p>
               <p>"A concatenation, a linking together; a marriage of hypothetical sensations and
                  perceptions, that waver and<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6426-00000072"/> glimmer
                  through fearful wildernesses, till the hypothetical soul, whether dormant or
                  rampant, listens wondering at the wild melodies of a life <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >quid est demonstrandum,</foreign> and is silent amid the mysterious harmonies
                  and sublime discords of a universe whose existence <foreign xml:lang="LAT">est

               <p>"But the <emph>question</emph> under present consideration."</p>
               <p>"'Consciousness is a unity.' Ah, if it could but teach me, that my supposed soul,
                  and that sweet illusion of a soul, were unity instead of duality or diversity!
                  What can a supposed <emph>reason</emph> do in such an emergency? Hobbes says, 'Men
                  set themselves against reason, when reason is against them. If mathematical truths
                  were found contrary to men's interests, their doctrines, if not disputed, would be
                  suppressed,' which perversity in human nature"——</p>
               <p>"The <emph>question</emph>—the <emph>question,</emph> Charlie! let's have the
                  QUESTION!"</p>
               <p>"In this question reason is powerless; fancy and imagination may accomplish their
                  supposed work. Sweet illusion, enter, and become to me as no illusion—a bright
                  reality—no dream! Come in, my beautiful! Kneel by my side! Let my fingers caress
                  those brown, waving tresses. Let me look down and answer that proud, shy, witching
                  devotion, gazing up from those deep, radiant eyes. Let me listen again to the
                  folly of those fascinating lips, till my whole being goes
                  <emph>insane.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Insane! You are perfectly raving! Let me feel your pulse again. Blister needed on
                  the temples! How is the heart, old fellow? Cupping to relieve the pain there."</p>
               <p>"On the hypothesis that I was once possessed of reason—that it is not yet
                  dispersed, I affirm, that I am not <emph>conscious</emph> of being in possession
                  of <emph>my</emph> heart—whatever may, according to Fichte, be the state of my
                  consciousness in regard to the <emph>soul.</emph> There <emph>seems</emph> to be
                     <emph>a</emph> heart, throbbing like a living earthquake, through this supposed
                  frame—fire as from the central depths feeding on these hypotheses of pulses. Is it
                     <emph>her</emph> heart? Is it an illusive, manly heart of flesh, or an
                  illusive, female, dreaming heart? It has lava-blood surging in its depths, and her
                  heart seemed burning, till the eye blazed."</p>
               <p>"Dangerous experiments of exchanging hearts, Charlie! Danger of total
                  annihilation! Come, come! It is a plain love case. Talk in rational language, and
                  free your mind to a friend who knows how to give you sympathy."</p>
               <p>"Yes, Guy, I'm in love! For several months past has your humble servant been
                  devoting his energies to the study of military tactics, planning desperate heart
                  sieges; also stupendous fortifications against the attacks of a powerful
                  enemy—said enemy being already in the camp, or the camp being in the hands of the
                  enemy—having surrendered without discretion, and gone into glorious
                  captivity."</p>
               <p>"Of course, it is the last angel out of paradise. You'll feel relieved now that
                  you have made confession. I will give you another yarn from my experience to show
                  you my sympathy."</p>
               <p>Guy commenced pacing backward and forward to collect the materials for his
                  confession from the recesses of his brain, but stumbled over some open volumes
                  that lay in his way.</p>
               <p>"Mehercule! What do you keep here? Medicine for love, I'll be sworn! Confessions
                  of Augustine, Comte, Kant, Montaigne, Molière, Swedenborg, Koran, Strauss, Bible,
                  Bayne, Kingsley, et cetera! A pretty collection, and so forth! These interesting
                  volumes may claim the paternity of the phenomena I have witnessed, and so on—the
                  heart-tearing balderdash and fanfaronade you have trumpeted to the four winds and
                  my ears. There was nothing new or original in your sentiments?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly not. Solomon said there was nothing <emph>new</emph> under the sun, in
                     <emph>his</emph> day. What could be expected of a fellow now? No doubt he could
                  best counsel me now, though, being acknowledged as the most devoted, of all poets
                  and philosophers, to the interests of the ladies. Like Adam, he gave up heaven for
                  love. Augustine's sentiments also are to the point. 'It is bliss to be loved, even
                  as we love. We desire to find <emph>life</emph> in that which we love.' Yet, to
                  Augustine also, as to Adam and Solomon, love became a curse."</p>
               <p>"The experience of all! Skepticism in youth as a disease; love, philosophy and
                  religion turning somerset together, and the life-problem all chaos. You have all
                  the diseases in one mass. Others see the same difficulties and walk over them
                  deliberately—get through the mire safely, too. I shall save my wits on those
                  points, close my eyes, and go through blind, knowing I should blind myself with
                  mud and mire if I were fool enough to open my eyes as you do to the darkness
                  visible. Do you believe in Revelation?"</p>
               <pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6426-00000073"/>
               <p>"I believe reason to be as much of a revelation as the Bible. Men tell us that
                  reason harmonizes with revelation. But I must confess, my reason has never seen
                  the harmony, or in any way become conscious of it. I believe in revelation because
                  I <emph>choose</emph> to believe it in spite of reason. It is beyond reason."</p>
               <p>"I suppose, too, you would have me believe in woman's purity and strength, on the

                  reason.'"</p>
               <p>"You have gone into wild places, Guy, to look for the proof of that."</p>
               <p>"I have never seen but one woman who, in my opinion, should be genuine, if the
                  genuine article exists."</p>
               <p>"Explain—I am anxious for your experience."</p>
               <p>"When Tom Creagh and myself were returning from our wild-goose chase over Texas
                  and Mexico, last winter, we stopped in New Orleans; and on the last night of our
                  stay, procured the entree to a grand masquerade there. Tom, you know, is
                  Byronic—fair skin, features beautiful as a woman—so he disguised himself as a
                  lady, and performed the jealous mistress, while I played devotion to a real
                  Sultana, whom I discovered reverizing by a column in a recess. She was of a rare
                  order of beauty, Charlie—jet black hair, pearly complexion, and blue eyes. I would
                  give half my fortune to know that she was a true woman, such as God made woman,
                  and intended man to keep her."</p>
               <p>"You would throw your heart and hand in the offer also?"</p>
               <p>"I did not learn even her name, but her image and spirit haunts me. If there is
                  such a thing as what the dreamers call communion of spirits, I was with her in all
                  her dreams last night."</p>
               <p>"I have no doubt you disturbed her peace. Is that all?"</p>
               <p>"That is the whole."</p>
               <p>"Then tell me what you think of this effusion as emanating from the brain and pen
                  of a girl of eighteen, among the hills of New England. Tell me if a pure, true
                  soul gave birth to these sentiments, or if the 'trail of the serpent' is here
                  also. Tell me if she is the temptress in the form of a seraph."</p>
               <p>It was a production of Magdalene Barclay's, that Frank Ross had sent Charlie

                  <p>"Arama, <emph>child of earth!</emph> In thy home among the noble and honorable,
                     Chie-ot-ys, <emph>the maiden,</emph> sends thee greeting: Thy memory has
                     haunted her by land and sea. Thou hast visited her in waking dreams and in
                     night visions. In the silence that has rolled long years between thee and her,
                     thy memory has been with her as a friendly presence, and yet no voice or tone
                     in the land of the living has been breathed to her soul from thee. She knows
                     thee to be honored by the good and wise—she knows that woman's love is
                     thine—that on thy heart reposes one dearer to thee than thine own soul—but now
                     she entreats thee to answer her soul's cry to thee. It is her spirit that is
                     calling to thy spirit—her spirit, weary with its search after thee! Thou, with
                     thy charmed eloquence, and thy brave life-dreams! If thou hast not quaffed the
                     cup of Lethe—if the gulf of oblivion has not rolled between thy soul and her
                     soul—she pleads with thee now to give her Nepenthe—to <emph>answer her soul's
                        greeting!</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>"Life to thee hath not been mockery! Thou hast taught her that the brave heart
                     can make the wilderness and the solitary places glad, and the desert to blossom
                     as the rose, for thou hast fought manfully the wild battle of life. Thou hast
                     fulfilled thy God-appointed destiny!</p>
                  <p>"There are other heroic souls than such as thine. Gaze deep into the unfathomed
                     eyes around, and when the soul kindles ever so dimly in their depths, ask of
                     that soul, What tidings? What of the spirit struggling in the clay? It may be
                     silent in its despair—silent because the sins of the fathers, descending to the
                     third and fourth generations, have fallen in vials of wrath and despair and
                     crushed out all hope. It may be silent to thy questioning, because it has
                     mastered its mighty sorrow—because it has communed with itself, and learned to
                        <emph>be still!</emph> The God-born soul, whose native home is light, whose
                     atmosphere and element is love, like the loves of the angels, has wandered
                     wearily in its tenement of clay—it has found darkness where it sought light—it
                     has won disease for beauty—it has met loathing for love. With what spirits,
                     ghouls and arch-demons has it not contended, alone and in darkness, struggling
                     away from death, yet longing for the peace of the grave, and conquered sorrow,
                     too, though gasping upon the grave's brink as conqueror!</p>

                  <p>"The spirit—the <emph>free</emph>-born spirit, striving upward to the
                     infinite—onward to the eternal! It has hungered for angels' food—it has been
                     fed on scorpions. It has thirsted for the waters of life—it has received
                     vinegar, mingled with gall!</p>
                  <p>"Of all this the soul, peering from sad, human eyes, is <emph>silent</emph> to
                     thy questioning. Aye, hero-heart, be silent. The stars have been silent since
                     their choral song of joy at the creation's dawn—forever silent. Heaven is
                     silent, far-off and dim to thy weary eyes; yet in the dim and distant heavens
                     are thy kindred, who watch thy silent tears. In the wilderness, they have been
                     near thee; they will not be <emph>forever</emph> silent, there shall yet come
                     to thee harmonies deeper than silence; there shall then be neither sorrow nor
                     sighing; and there shall be no more curse!</p>
                  <p>"Arama, <emph>child of earth!</emph> God's truth hath dawned in thy soul. Thou
                     didst win her to thy embrace; thou didst not send her an outcast from thee;
                     thou didst not weary of her caresses, and because thou didst not reject her,
                     she has been <emph>all</emph> to thee. In thy deathly soul-sickness, she has
                     come to thee with healing on her wing. She has given thee beauty for ashes, and
                     the garments of joy for the spirit of heaviness. She has attuned thy nature
                     into unison with the burning harmonies that abound in the universe of the
                     Almighty. The light of the ever-shining stars, the silver and the golden
                     radiance of heaven, are dim by the pure God's light of truth, that has poured
                     itself upon thee. The truth hath given thee strength to conquer—all spirits of
                     evil have knelt at thy feet, or been driven back to their homes in the abyss.
                     Death had been sweet to thee, because of the loved, the beautiful, the eternal,
                     the infinite, beyond the bourne of his sceptre. A perpetual pæan has thrilled
                     thy soul, when thou hast sounded to the weary, the sinful, the broken-hearted,
                     and the down-pressed, the trumpet's deep and solemn note, bidding them up and
                     onward, for the God of the lowly in heart, and the Most High God of Battles was
                     one God.</p>
                  <p>"Arama—<emph>child of earth!</emph> solitude hath been thy home, but thou hast
                     found companionship with truth. Thou hast thrown thyself a loving child upon
                     her bosom, in full, free, utter abandon; she hath enfolded thee with passionate
                     fervor in her all-clasping arms—hath lifted thee up, lest thou shouldst dash
                     thy foot against a stone. And with her thy spirit hath gone forth, with broad,
                     strong, rejoicing wing, sweeping upon the deserts and the mountain heights, in
                     night and storm and chaos; it hath brooded over the abyss; it hath penetrated
                     silences; it hath held converse with the invisible; it hath searched into the
                     heart of the universe, and the great heart of the universe throbs on forever,
                     and the life of the universal heart is Love.</p>

                     <p>Guy smoked in profound silence for some time.</p>
                     <p>"She evidently supposes that the <emph>child of earth</emph>—meaning
                           <emph>you,</emph> probably—has a good share of the angelic in his

                     <p>"And ignores the devil."</p>
                     <p>"As we all do in love."</p>

                     <p>"It being acknowledged that we worship ideals, making them idols."</p>
                     <p>"Go on, Guy; what do you think of her?"</p>
                     <p>"She evidently has noble elements; is capable of great womanly sacrifice and
                        devotion; could become what woman ought to become on earth, an <emph>angel
                           of purification</emph> to such sinners as we."</p>
                     <p>"It is woman's mission to walk amid pollution without becoming polluted—to
                        purify—to burn out with the fire of sacrifice the evil within us."</p>
                     <p>"If the evil in that woman ever does triumph over the good!"</p>
                     <p>"What then?"</p>
                     <p>"If you ever turn devil to her—she thinks you an angel now, and worships
                        you; but if she ever <emph>hates</emph> you as she can hate, she would
                        become to you a worse devil than your wildest dreams ever could conceive. It
                        is the noblest, the most nearly perfect of all, who become most thoroughly
                        accursed when wrong has changed their natures. Satan, the prince of the Pit,
                        was a regal spirit in heaven, Milton says."</p>
                     <p>"She is not yet angel, Guy—a child of earth herself, but incapable of that
                        deep hatred. She is not yet angel—she may develop into one of the noblest.
                        She shall never be tempted beyond refuge! I will shield her from temptation
                        forever. I will guard her with life and sacred honor—so help me God!"</p>
                     <p>She is God's and not yours, Charles Moore; and through passionate sorrow,
                        and weariness of spirit must the elements in her develop to the angelic.</p>
                     <p>It was a dream of yours that you would <emph>save</emph> her—a noble
                        dream—so the young often dream when heaven is near them—and your
                           <emph>good</emph> angel was triumphant then."</p>

               <p>"GOOD bye, Charlie, my boy!" said Guy, coming in one day shortly afterward,
                  equipped for travelling. "Good bye, I'm off for Mississippi on furlough!"</p>
               <p>"The deuce you are! Why, you was off last year. How do you find favor at head
                  quarters in that style?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I've come of age, and my guardian is anxious to resign a law-suit into my

               <p>"But don't go yet, Guy! My father, mother and sis are to be here next week, and I

               <p>"Next week? I wish it were possible to stay."</p>
               <p>"I've promised Lizzy an introduction to you."</p>
               <p>Guy pondered in solemn, disappointed silence full fifteen minutes, biting his
                  lips.</p>
               <p>"It is worse than Tantalus and his torments, Charlie. I would give up my
                  fortune—almost—to see her, but the long and short of the matter is, I can't do it.
                  Go I <emph>must!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"When will you see her, then? Come to Huntsville after we graduate next summer?
                  But she may be married and gone to the moon by that time. No calculating on the
                  whims of ladies. Do stay, Guy."</p>
               <p>"It breaks my heart to go, Charlie, but I must do it. I will go home with you next
                  summer though. Good bye! God bless you, Charlie, and <emph>take a liking to you,
                     old fellow!</emph>"</p>
               <p>Guy Erwin wrung his hand and was gone—leaving Charlie in a reverie in which he
                  remained for a short age of half an hour.</p>
               <p>"If he can get a furlough, the Old Nick may take me if I don't do the same. I'll
                  be off to those New England mountains with Lizzy. There is some one I intend to
                  see again, or I'll shoot myself! That matter is settled."</p>
               <p>And having settled the affair to his satisfaction, he took<pb n="150-151"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000076"/> himself to the interesting occupation of writing
                  poetry—a sure symptom of an affection of the heart, especially in students and
                  school-girls. Mag, as we know, had the symptoms in their worst form, and Charlie
                  reciprocated with all his heart.</p>
               <p>The employment occupied his attention fully until his parents and sister arrived
                  the next week, when his time and attention both were given to aid Lizzy in playing
                  belle at West Point.</p>
               <p>He lounged into her apartments at Roe's hotel one day, and found her indulging in
                  the disorder that she might have caught from him—a brown meditation.</p>
               <p>"What weighty matter is troubling your mind, sis?" he asked. "It is an alarmingly

                  turn your attention to wisdom, Lizzy; it won't pay.</p>
               <p>"Prove it, Charlie. Would a chapter from your life prove it?"</p>
               <p>"I could <emph>reason</emph> it out for you in faultless logic."</p>
               <p>"I am not in a logical frame of mind; I should prefer proof from experience; I
                  have been meditating on the wants of human nature in general, and feminine natures
                  in particular—of course judging the wants of human nature in the mass by an
                  individual in the mass—myself."</p>
               <p>"As ladies always do; they were never known to give a <emph>reason</emph> for the
                  hope within them—little hope is there for the reason in them."</p>
               <p>"That speech is decidedly gallant, brother; worthy a southern gentleman."</p>
               <p>"Ladies are queer commodities anyhow. I've studied them for nearly a quarter of a
                  century, and my study has amounted to pretty much nothing. I am not much better
                  off now from the research than I was <emph>fifty</emph> years ago."</p>
               <p>"Providence never intended us to be reasonable beings."</p>
               <p>"If he did intend it, the intention was never fulfilled. A reasonable being
                  couldn't begin to guess how any one of the race would act under any given set of
                  circumstances."</p>
               <p>"No; we never go plodding after facts and knowledge by any roundabout way of
                     <emph>reason;</emph> we scorn the slow process; we take the cross-roads to our
                  conclusions; knowledge is intuitive; we move by inspiration; are guided by pure
                  instinct."</p>
               <p>"Amen—amen—go on, sis."</p>
               <p>"You of the <emph>reasonable</emph> gender stray into most woefully false
                  conclusions at times. We go by the light of nature, and never very far from truth.
                  I am thankful I never studied metaphysics."</p>
               <p>"It would have been your ruin, Lizzy."</p>
               <p>"In politics and religion you of the masculine genus produce confusion worse
                  confounded by your logic, till we of the intuitive order puzzle our bedazzled wits
                  to discover whether reason itself is not a phantom; we cannot divine whether it is
                  like a living creature, with flesh and bones and veins—with marrow in the bones,
                  blood in the veins, and bloom upon the flesh—or whether it is not like a
                  fleshless, bloodless, lifeless skeleton, that rattles its grim, gaunt limbs with a
                  clattering and chattering of unmeaning sounds; or whether it is like a spectre
                  that visits mortals who would penetrate beyond the ken of mortal vision to punish
                  them for their vain presumption."</p>
               <p>"Bravo! bravissimo, sis!"</p>
               <p>"We ladies are fond of creating confusion and chaos in our sphere. We exult in our
                  work, because no one ever dreams of calling us to an account for our misdeeds! The
                  pun was accidental!" Charlie groaned.</p>
               <p>"Brother, my feminine nature experiences a want. It would now be a sublime episode
                  in my existence if a <emph>man</emph> would enter my sphere. I am in agony to
                     <emph>adore a man.</emph> I know I have the faculty, the capacity of adoration
                  in my nature, but it is lying undeveloped for want of an object to call it into
                  life."</p>
               <p>"You are anxious to live a large, high, broad, deep life—up to all the potential
                  privileges of a woman's nature. You are right."</p>
               <p>"Do you know, Charlie, a handsome man is ten thousand times handsomer than a
                  handsome woman. I have seen many a <emph>handsome</emph> man, but never a really
                  wise, noble, <emph>adorable</emph> man crossed my orbit of existence."</p>
               <p>"Your atmosphere repels the wise probably. There is no magnetism in your presence
                  to attract men who are men. Is not the fault your own?"</p>
               <p>"Who taught you to be a Job's comforter, Charlie? I have an intense longing to
                  meet a man in full proportions—a man—not a monkey."</p>
               <p>"Your tastes are praiseworthy, sis. I am proud of them. It is refreshing to listen
                  to the recital of such feminine<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6426-00000077"/>
                  aspirations. I marvel much what experiences gave rise to such yearning
                  desires."</p>
               <p>"If you could but know! Tout le monde, comme une éruption, have showered me with
                  flattery. Gentlemen never consider a lady worthy of other entertainment than
                  recounting to her the list of her perfections. Gallantry is the business and
                  accomplishment of gentlemen with ladies."</p>
               <p>"You have been persecuted for righteousness' sake, no doubt."</p>
               <p>"One exhausts all that 'society' can teach in a week. I can prophesy your
                  entertainment for every lady at the next soirée. You will convince every one you
                  meet that she is a seraph, to keep yourself in practice. You are the devoted lover
                  of the 'eleven thousand virgins of Cologne,' and each is a bright particular
                  star."</p>
               <p>"It is a burning pity, sis," said Charlie, laughing, "that Guy Erwin left last
                  week. You two ought to be caged together for a month, to relieve yourselves by a
                  discussion of human frailty. Your sympathies would overflow in showers."</p>
               <p>"I have no doubt he is a perfectly trained gallant like yourself—says nothing but
                  sweet things to every lady he meets—makes love to Miss A. because she is
                  attractive enough to amuse him; to Miss B. because she expects it; to Miss C.
                  because she craves it—yet is so ugly that no one else will do it, so he
                  magnanimously performs it as an act of Christian charity, and takes credit to
                  himself for comprehending the spirit of the golden rule."</p>
               <p>"You are severe, sis. Our cadet training is not of that order."</p>
               <p>"You soldiers cultivate chivalry."</p>
               <p>"There are numerous flirtations here, I acknowledge, during encampment life, but
                  the greatest reason is, that ladies think all military fair game, and are
                  perfectly unscrupulous as to the degree of their deceptions. Cadets are young,
                  very enthusiastic, and rather verdant. The majority think that they are the
                  champions of honor, and that it would be a disgrace second to none to deceive a
                  lady. I deny your charges in the name of the order."</p>
               <p>"You all get bravely over that <emph>honor</emph> after one campaign of
                  flirtations. Not much of it do you see in the army."</p>
               <p>"You make out life to be one grand <emph>masquerade.</emph> You agree with
                  Talleyrand, that language was given to <emph>conceal</emph> thought."</p>
               <p>"Speaking of masquerades, they are excessively entertaining at times. Mystery runs
                  wild, and the mysterious is the glory of life. I amused myself delightfully in St.
                  Louis and New Orleans, last winter."</p>
               <p>"Do relate your experience, sis. It must be instructive."</p>
               <p>A sudden memory came over Lizzy, sending animation into her blue eyes.</p>
               <p>"I must tell you, Charlie, I met my <foreign xml:lang="FRA">beau-ideal</foreign>
                  at a masquerade in New Orleans, last winter. He appeared in the form of a Spanish
                  Cavalier—there was a haughty, slow grace in his motion—and then his
                     <emph>voice!</emph> There is more <emph>soul</emph> in the voice than in all
                  else that makes a man. I like your voice, Charlie, it is deep and full, there is
                  energy in it. His voice was rich and low; there was a sad, pleading music in it—a
                  subtle wavering expression to the undertones, that echoed in my soul, haunting it
                  afterward, as if I had heard the music in childhood."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps it was a prophetic note for the future. If coming events cast their
                  shadows before, why not coming music tones send echoes onward?"</p>
               <p>"Charlie, have a cigar for the suggestion. I hope it is a prophesy."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Lizzy; the cigar is a happy suggestion."</p>
               <p>"And I'll put you to sleep with a tale. It is a comfort to know a tale that will
                  require a cigar."</p>
               <p>Charlie lit the cigar, and extended himself upon a sofa.</p>
               <p>"I played belle in New Orleans till I was sick of the honors of belledom. I say it
                  in all humility, brother. My 'adorers' had flooded me with bouquets in numbers
                  like the locusts in Egypt, till I was tempted to sell them, and send the proceeds
                  to another set of heathen, for whom there might be some hopes of conversion—the
                     <emph>uncivilized.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"A <emph>savage</emph> remark, sis—a <emph>barbarous</emph> cut."</p>
               <p>"And serenades! I had listened to them till I wished every baboon of the
                  serenaders safe in a menagerie!"</p>
               <p>"Guard your language, sis. Don't spoil those lips with anything but chaste and
                  refined expressions. I could not kiss them otherwise! But, oh, Guy! Guy Erwin, if
                  thou couldst but listen!"</p>
               <p>"Well, at this masquerade I had secured a few minutes of solitude in a recess—was
                  watching the mysteries among the masquers—fancying all the hollowness of heart
                     and<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6426-00000078"/> disease of soul that lay
                  concealed under the splendor and beauty—when the cavalier addressed me: 'Have I
                  the happiness of knowing your name, peri of the Sultan?' I replied, of course, in
                  some customary nonsense. 'A rose by any other name would smell as sweet,' and
                  there followed the usual battery of compliment, from which I shielded myself with
                  as saucy badinage as I could manufacture—measuring, meanwhile, the magnificent
                  proportions of the man. I was wondering what sin, or temptation, or weakness had
                  marred God's image in his soul, when a lady passed us, and whispered passionately
                  in my ear: 'He is a deceiver, lady; at your peril, you listen!' Of course, the Eve
                  in my nature was roused. If the fruit was forbidden, I must gather it, so I
                  accepted his escort for a promenade. He watched the lady, who soon passed us, and
                  her whisper again vibrated on my ear: 'Beware, lady! I warn you, beware! He has
                  the serpent's tongue!' The play became more interesting; it was interwoven with
                  golden mystery. Again she passed us, and I heard the hiss for his ears: 'Do not
                  dare me too far! As you value your <emph>life</emph> or hers, I tell you, beware!'
                  I began to think the play serious, especially when my cavalier excused himself a
                  moment, addressed her a few energetic sentences, then returned to me with a smile
                  like a sudden gush of sunshine. I had a curiosity to see the lady's face, if it
                  would give a clue to the mystery. I spent the evening with the cavalier, accepted
                  his escort to supper, where all unmask. The lady was there, opposite us and
                  watching us, and the only one of all the assembly who refused to unmask. I was
                  never able to discover the slightest clue concerning them."</p>
               <p>Charlie laughed at the tale, as if infinitely amused.</p>
               <p>"Special Providence, sis! Oh, Guy Erwin, if you could but listen! Keep good
                  courage, Lizzy. Your heart will come back to you in safe keeping. If mine would
                  only return to me, I could sympathize with you, for my heart, Lizzy, has been a
                  minus quantity during a round year and a day."</p>
               <p>Lizzy raised her eyelids in astonishment, and swept back one of the raven curls
                  that obscured her vision.</p>
               <p>"Well, let us hear the particulars of your history, brother, since we parted last.
                  How have you employed yourself?"</p>
               <p>"As I just hinted, in the most natural way possible. Firstly, I fell in love,
                  which you assure me is one of the proclivities of my nature; it was accomplished
                  by the laws of gravitation. I have busied myself ever since that event in
                     <emph>climbing out,</emph> so that I may be able to take a second plunge. It is
                  a ravishing sensation."</p>
               <p>And Charlie, as usual, smoked himself into a reverie, while Lizzy assumed a most
                  wicked look of skepticism. Her brother caught the look as he glanced up at
                  last.</p>
               <p>"Procul, procul este, O profana!" he exclaimed. "You cannot enter my sanctum with
                  a face like that."</p>
               <p>"Pardonnez moi, mon cher frère! I am all reverence. And the lady—Aspasia? Zenobia?
                  Cleopatra? Boadicea? which?"</p>
               <p>"Neither, Lizzy. Never was another mortal molded after her model."</p>
               <p>"Ahem!"</p>
               <p>"Just so, sis!—prodigiously sensible remark of yours—so to the point. As I was
                  saying, she is neither tall nor short, plump nor thin, fair nor dark; she has
                  eyes"——</p>
               <p>"I am astonished to learn that last item."</p>
               <p>"They are of an uncertain color—dark green on ordinary occasions—on extraordinary
                  occasions they flash out to the color of a storm-cloud on which lightning is
                  playing."</p>
               <p>"No wonder you were extinguished."</p>
               <p>"She must be nearly at the ripe age of eighteen—has neither father nor mother,
                  sister nor brother; her only earthly fortune consists of our cousin, Frank Ross,
                  student of Yale College, of whom I am distractingly jealous."</p>
               <p>"Jealous of the cousin, or the college?"</p>
               <p>"She has an innumerable list of accomplishments and perfections. She can hunt,
                  fish, row boats, play ball, climb trees, drive wild horses, shoot with
                     pistols—<emph>also plough!</emph> I saw her unyoke a pair of oxen one day for a
                  phenomenon whose cognomen was Uncle Alph. I lost my heart while practising with
                  her at pistol-shooting."</p>
               <p>"Do you intend to build a wigwam for her? She'll be a curiosity in Huntsville.
                  Perhaps you'll take her into the army first."</p>
               <p>"I shall bless my stars if I ever persuade her to do either. The little lady has
                  had the good sense, propriety, delicacy, and discretion to discard me, Lizzy."</p>
               <p>"That was sensible of her—evidently a lady of taste."</p>
               <p>"I never tasted, sis, she showed such distaste for me."</p>
               <p>"I don't comprehend you, brother!" ejaculated Lizzy—a<pb n="156-157"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000079"/> look of the most profound astonishment impressing
                  itself upon every lineament of her Juno face.</p>
               <p>"Understand, I am not afflicted, like yourself, with the want of an object to
                  adore; I find divinities manufactured to suit my most fastidious taste—most
                     <emph>adorable</emph> earthly deities. My sorrow is, that my ideal does not
                  reciprocate my adoration—a tribulation you have never experienced."</p>
               <p>Lizzy looked breathless.</p>
               <p>"How did you console yourself?"</p>
               <p>"I studied the ancients for one remedy; I philosophized extensively for some
                  months—dipped into theology again—at last I poetized over my misfortunes; the last
                  relieved me. I'll show you some of the productions of the muses."</p>
               <p>"No doubt they are touching."</p>
               <p>"But the heathen philosophy I found most suited to my taste. I inverted the order
                  of things, and laid a large foundation of it on Fichte, thus: 'Every joy is
                  granted us but to strengthen us for further exertion. Life is for
                     <emph>labor.</emph> We frame our fate, yet its management requires only
                     <emph>self-culture.</emph>' And again: 'For the man of genius there is no
                  education but what he gives himself.' And thus, again: 'Circumstances cannot
                  control a great soul; the soul forms its own circumstances.' Love is but a
                     <emph>circumstance</emph> of earthly development, which must be controlled—a
                  lesson from which we must extract the utmost secret."</p>
               <p>"Teach me the secrets, Charlie; a lady never learns them."</p>
               <p>"But I was speaking of the heathen philosophy. Is not this beautiful? 'God existed
                  first in luminous shadows: in shadows, because being is indeterminate—luminous,
                  because being is light. Originally he existed in a divine <emph>slumber</emph>—the
                  creative energy was yet asleep.' But a 'luminous shadow' flitted between my soul
                  and this exquisite philosophy, and created chaos, that 'brooded over the abyss' of
                  thought, thus. Grand ideas those heathens originated; that of burning their widows
                  was sublime. I appreciate the original beauty of that divine doctrine; I will
                  teach its harmony to my 'ideal,' when, as Plato teaches, the two wandering halves
                  of our one soul have met and formed unity—one flesh. That unity ought never to be
                  destroyed on earth, and those Hindoos knew it—that dissolved, yet united in
                  flames, the unity should flee to the hereafter."</p>
               <p>"I am sleepy, Charlie; I'll take the poetry next, if you please."</p>
               <p>"You don't appreciate my efforts, Lizzy."</p>
               <p>"I am afraid you damaged quite a quantity of very fine paper. I hope your disease
                  has produced no worse damage. But it really would be soothing to my feelings if I
                  could have a more definite description of your belle-ideal. I see there is some

               <p>"Won't intuition, or pure instinct, or the light of nature aid you in your efforts
                  to discover her attractions?"</p>
               <p>"Of course, she is your <emph>opposite</emph> in all things. You have what the
                  poets call eyes of <emph>heavenly</emph> hue."</p>
               <p>"Ergo, hers must be tinted from the <emph>lower</emph> regions. You have decided
                  penetration, sis."</p>
               <p>"I should infer she was anything but lovely."</p>
               <p>"Being, as you say, my <emph>opposite</emph> in all things."</p>
               <p>"Charles Atherton Moore!"</p>
               <p>"Sister Lizzy!"</p>
               <p>"You are incorrigible!"</p>
               <p>"Go on, Lizzy, you will <emph>reason</emph> out all her perfections, if you are
                  only sufficiently persevering; you've made a brave attempt."</p>
               <p>A look of annoyance and sadness began to settle on Lizzy's beautiful features.</p>
               <p>"Forgive me, sis, and I will endeavor to redeem myself. It is a solemn truth that
                  I have lost my heart—that a charming, piquant, original little mortal, proud as
                  any prince of fallen angels, has won it. I found that strange girl among the
                  mountains of New England. It was a powerful magnet that drew my heart from my
                  possession, spite of all my efforts to retain it; it was a magic witchery about my
                  enchantress. She is not always beautiful, yet at times, the dark, gazelle eyes,
                  and the radiant face, are lighted, by the inspiration of genius, into dazzling
                  loveliness. Her figure is modelled from the statue of Venus—developed in the same
                  proportions of bust, and hand, and foot; not small, but perfectly molded. Art has
                  never tortured nature into miniature deformity in any one of her rounded, perfect
                  limbs. There is a lithesome, swaying grace in every one of her bewitching
                  movements; they are inspiring, but not voluptuous—exquisitely fascinating, but she
                  captivates the intellect more than the senses. She might, if she chose, tempt me
                  to violate every law of the decalogue; yet the highest charm of her witchery is,
                  that it is purifying; her presence, her atmosphere is redolent with innocence and
                  truth. My <emph>entire</emph> nature goes out to<pb n="158-159"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000080"/> meet hers; my spirit bends with her spirit, when
                  her spirit invites me; her intellect meets my intellect; her physique delights my
                  senses; her soul <emph>is</emph> my soul; in all its noble and holy aspirations,
                  we are one soul; we harmonize 'like the lovely marriage of sweet sounds.' She is
                  my Eve, if an Eve has been created for me; my Zoë, my life—'the large fulfillment
                  of life's longing dreams.'"</p>
               <p>Charlie paused, and there was a silence.</p>
               <p>"Thank you, dear Brother Charlie Moore," said Lizzy, at length. "I love you
                  royally for that. It is all like you, and you are like yourself now—my brother,
                  whom I shall adore till I can find a better ideal for worship."</p>
               <p>Lizzy knelt down by his side, twined her arms around his neck, smoothed away some
                  stray raven curls from his brow with her white, slender fingers, and touched the
                  regal lips with her own. Charlie approved of his sister then.</p>
               <p>"And now," said she, "I will be good and attentive while you read me the poetry;
                  and I will try hard not to be sleepy."</p>
               <p>She cushioned herself back in a fauteuil, and fanned away the flies, and called
                  out some artificial zephyrs to play among Charlie's curls, while he threw aside
                  his cigar, and, stretched upon the sofa, made the most impassioned music in the
                  lines, of which they and his voice were capable:</p>

               <head>XIV. AMONG THE MOUNTAINS.</head>
               <p>A GOLDEN evening in August. The sun was setting beyond the western mountains; the
                  hush preceding twilight was settling down upon the valley; Glenlyn was nestling to
                  repose. The busy hum of labor had ceased; the farmer was returning from the field;
                  the herds droning home from the pastures on the hills; the village boys at their
                  last game of ball on the green, and the gossiping girls preparing to say good
                  night. The twilight stillness was preparing for dreams in the forests, and the
                  leaves rustling a lullaby with the breezes to the birds carrying home the supper
                  of the birdlings; the baby-birds were twittering good night in their nests, and
                  the crickets chirping the prelude of their night-song to the weary.</p>
               <p>Mag was sitting solitary upon the grass-plot beneath the locusts, her spirit
                  uttering itself to the evening hush, watching the passers; listlessly amusing
                  herself by tracing the thoughts flitting over the human faces. Alec Ross and Josie
                  Newton strolled by, but Mag was already tired of the commonplace tale she read
                  there; the plot was too plainly developed.</p>
               <p>She sent a thought after Min and her fortunes. Min had gone home; Min had met her
                  destiny in the form of a young law student; a graduate of Yale; a friend of
                  Frank's, and Min was verging toward woman's fate.</p>
               <p>Mag smiled as a thought of Mr. Brown, the minister, crossed her mind.</p>
               <p>"You'll have to manage that Mr. Brown," Frank had said. "This is the way to do it.
                  Do you get Mrs. Brown to give you music lessons. Come down and practise on
                  mother's piano, if I can't persuade her to give it to you. You have a voice of
                  unusual compass, and it is a shame that all the cultivation it gets is at
                  singing-schools, and by mocking the canaries. Father will pay Mrs. Brown, and do
                  you play music with her and the deuce with him; cover him with soft-soap to his
                  eyes; you can do it if you half<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6426-00000082"/> try;
                  feed him with sugar-plums till he is sick and ready to swallow you. Do it
                     <emph>good,</emph> and don't let it distract your conscience, you conscientious
                  little soul. You are to do it all in <emph>self-defence.</emph> It is never going
                  to do for you, that he should call you a skeptic, and that will stop the reverend
                  gentleman's mouth—take my word for it."</p>
               <p>Mag had obeyed Frank's reverential advice, and was taking the music lessons. She
                  had learned one lesson that was invaluable, and smiled as she sat alone and
                  repeated it to her queen regent. "When by mistake, or accident, or carelessness,
                  Miss Barclay, you have struck discordant notes in the song of life, remember you
                  must strike harmonious chords as soon after as possible, that the harshness and
                  jar of discord may be forgotten in the unusual sweetness of the vibration. You
                  made some mistakes in the Overture; be sure now that the Anthem of Life be
                  correctly performed, and the closing notes shall be a pæan of triumph."</p>
               <p>Mag gave heed to the advice, and commenced an introspection of her own heart with
                  its mysteries. She wandered with memory through strange halls, and gazed on
                  beautiful pictures—searching unconsciously for the unforgotten and beloved—aye,
                  and <emph>adored</emph>—the one being whom she had <emph>given up forever!</emph>
                  And one picture haunted her, turn whither she would; it was of a gorgeous
                  moonlight, with a strange gleaming lustre—deep, passionate, reproachful eyes
                  sought and fathomed hers; their light still illumined her heart, though in a year
                  of rolling months she had not known their living spell. She tried at last to turn
                  from the picture, but there was magic in it, and so Mag probed her heart again and
                  again.</p>
               <p>This habit of introspection is in itself a disease. Morbid souls continually probe
                  themselves; the healthful soul looks <emph>out</emph> from itself into the world
                  and the world's heart; it finds its life in <emph>action,</emph> not reverie; it
                  learns itself in quick, earnest, diving glances down to the depths of being; in
                  hours of intense true thought it learns itself and its kind, and then the soul
                  expands by <emph>action.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>By a powerful effort of the will, Mag averted her eyes from that bright picture;
                  turned it to the wall, and endeavored to convince herself that the royal presence
                  was forgotten; that those deep, earnest eyes, with their wistful, loving reproach,
                  would never haunt her more, because she had broken the spell forever.</p>
               <p>And then she became proud of her strength—exulted in the might of her human
                     <emph>will.</emph> By its power she had achieved such self-conquest! Strength
                  in itself was glorious. Even the strength of passion was sublime. Let the passions
                  rage proud, wild and free in the human heart; let them do their worst, exert their
                  strength to the uttermost; let the heart of flesh be torn, riven, almost
                  annihilated by the convulsions of the elements. The warfare of the strong passions
                  of earth was a terrible thing—but the one human <emph>will</emph> could control
                  them—was mightier than legions of passion-fiends. One will could bind the
                  tempests, and force the elements to obey with its calm command of "Peace, be
                  still!"</p>
               <p>How Mag exulted in her glorious <emph>will.</emph> She had smiled as, in fancy,
                  she placed her foot upon the writhing passion-fiends. She had conquered herself,
                  nothing human could ever again disturb the placid rest of her soul. Her nature had
                  borne the earthquake shock—the strong, rushing wind had swept its mightiest blast
                  over her—the volcano poured its hot heart into hers, yet she stood strong,
                  unscathed, as one of God's free angels! Poor Mag!</p>
               <p>To the prophet of God in the wilderness, there came a still small voice that
                  swayed his soul with a power mightier than the earthquake shock, or the rushing
                  tempest.</p>
               <p>But Mag sat upon the grass-plot under the locusts, and dreamed on. Nature's voices
                  came and talked to nature's child; the winds whispered their dreams with hers, and
                  the murmurs of restless babbling waters mingled with the murmurs of the restless
                  spirit, till her very soul was tremulous with the restless, triumphant emotions;
                  the proud joy quivered along every nerve—this joy was sweeter than rest—this was
                  victory. She had met fate. She had argued with destiny, and dared her to do her
                  worst! Poor Mag!</p>
               <p>She had decided that her spirit was <emph>free,</emph> for her will was
                  unconquerable. She had trampled temptation beneath her feet!</p>
               <p>Oh, Mag! "Pride goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall."
                  "Let him who thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall."</p>
               <p>And, Mag, what vision is now dawning upon those orbs from amid the hues of the
                  sunset glory? The pupil of your dark eye is dilating with emotion—your nostril is
                  quivering—a pale, restless tremor is awaking upon those<pb n="164-165"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000083"/> love-inspiring lips! What spirit appears before you
                  that has so driven the blood from your cheek and brow? Your every pulse and nerve
                  is palpitating! Where is now your boasted strength—your mighty <emph>will?</emph>
                  You are striving to rise, but you cannot lift yourself from the greensward. You
                  are battling down your throbbing pulses in vain; the heart, with one convulsive,
                  desperate bound, has leaped to your throat, and is stifling you! Oh,
                  dreamer!—proud, vain dreamer!—dreamer of royal dreams! You have conquered passion!
                  You have conquered fate! You have decided the point with destiny! Oh, woman! True
                  woman! Proudest of your own weakness! Most confident of what first betrays you!
                  You are <emph>free!</emph> Why do you not use your freedom? Why not rise from your
                  seat in the dust? Trust the might of human will no longer!</p>
               <p>You have <emph>given up</emph> human love? Put temptation beneath your feet?</p>
               <p>Charles Atherton Moore, whom you have <emph>given up,</emph> is entering the
                  cottage gate, and your passionate human heart is paralyzed.</p>
               <p>You are conscious of but his presence, which now fills your universe. You are
                  paralyzed because you see his living face. To you it is radiant with princely
                  beauty. The smile wreathing his haughty lip is rare and sweet to you as your
                  dreams of heaven. That powerful frame, so lithe in its elegance, those firm,
                  rounded, muscular limbs, are to you the very symbol of might and strength and
                  manliness, and his voice is to thrill to the innermost recesses of your being with
                  its passionate eloquence. Why do you not rise and give him a modest maiden's calm
                  greeting? Why not look up to answer his earnest, impassioned gaze, and the
                  impassioned joy in the accent of those simple words:</p>
               <p>"Magdalene Barclay!"</p>
               <p>You are motionless—breathless—nerveless, Magdalene Barclay, and we are impatient
                  that a foolish maiden has no art to control her foolish heart.</p>
               <p>Charles Moore is by your side, before you, looking down upon the revelation so
                  plainly written upon that pale face. He is penetrating the hidden depths with
                  those piercing eyes, fathoming secrets in your soul that you have never
                  acknowledged to yourself. His hands are extended to lift you into his presence,
                  for you have found favor with your King, Queen Esther. The royal sceptre is
                  extended to you. And those warm fingers have woven a new life along your nerves.
                  You stand meekly beneath his ardent gaze. You sun yourself in his presence. The
                  warm blood courses again through the pulses, mantling cheek and lip and brow.
                  Passion is bounding again over the senses. Your own rare smile breaks from those
                  sweet lips—kindles those eyes, soft as the antelope's, into their deepest
                  beauty.</p>
               <p>Now, at last, you answer his earnest greeting:</p>
               <p>"I am glad to see you, Mr. Moore."</p>
               <p>The words are simple enough, but they satisfy him to the innermost fibre of his
                  nature. That blood fluttering to your temples speaks eloquently. He exults at his
                  power.</p>
               <p>"Call me Charlie, little Eve. Repeat the words, I am glad to see you,
                  Charlie."</p>
               <p>"I am glad to see you, Charlie Moore. I am strangely glad to see you."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, little siren. Those words from your lips are the richest language
                  earth ever gave me. It is like your truthful simplicity to utter such music. I am
                  glad and proud to see you again—to see your <emph>living</emph> self. You have
                  come to me many times in dreams, but that was like you, too, like your wild
                  witchery. How my pulse has thrilled as your figure, in its elastic grace, flitted
                  before me and knelt at my side; but you have grown even more beautiful than my
                  dreams of you. Tell me once more that you are <emph>glad</emph> to see me,
                  Magdalene. Repeat the music."</p>
               <p>"Why did you come? How did you come? When did you come out among these
                  mountains?"</p>
               <p>"Repeat, I am glad so see you, Charlie."</p>
               <p>"How lordly and magnificent you have grown!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, tell me you are proud of me."</p>
               <p>"I will give you permission, Lieutenant Charles Atherton Moore, to sit on the
                  door-step yonder, and while I stand before you, you may give an account of
                  yourself, your heart-life, head-life, and social life, since we parted."</p>
               <p>"My <emph>heart</emph>-life, when it has been in your possession entirely and
                  devotedly? When, without once examining its truthfulness, you have crushed it,
                  made it your sport and plaything?"</p>
               <p>"The wickedness has not been taken out of you, even by all the military discipline
                  and training."</p>
               <p>"Nor by the penances you have made me undergo. Well, finish your work, pronounce
                  some incantation to exorcise the evil spirits, then establish yourself my guardian
                  angel."</p>
               <pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6426-00000084"/>
               <p>"I decline the office. I never was intended for an earth angel. And what legions
                  of evil spirits your guardian angel must control! He must be a mighty spirit."</p>
               <p>"Go on, Magdalene. Your eyes are magnificent now. I <emph>have</emph> been a sad
                  reprobate. But, oh, how you have sinned against me for a long, long year!"</p>
               <p>"A whole year, during which I have forgotten you, and you have forgotten me. What
                  chance sent you here now?"</p>
               <p>"I knew you were remembering me. A good spirit came and told me that you could not
                  forget me, cruel as you were; that you were painting my image in your soul almost
                  as faithfully as I was worshipping yours, engraved in mine. So I reported at
                  head-quarters that a little madcap girl, half Minerva and half Venus, out among
                  the Green Mountains, had stolen my heart, and there was a dire necessity that I
                  should come to its rescue before it became a hopeless ruin. It was burning itself
                  to ashes, and my presence was needful to watch the phœnix that must rise."</p>
               <p>"What a catastrophe!"</p>
               <p>"And I have come to prove to you that I will not be overcome of evil, but I will
                  overcome evil with good. I intend to heap coals of fire upon your head."</p>
               <p>"I don't doubt it; and how they will burn—spoil my hair entirely."</p>
               <p>"You are the worst enemy of my peace; and, oh, how I love my enemy! I knew she was
                  hungering, out here in the wilderness, and I intend to feed her"——</p>
               <p>"With stones instead of bread. For fish you'll give her scorpions."</p>
               <p>"She is thirsting for nectar and ambrosia, and I shall feed her with the food of
                  gods."</p>
               <p>"You'll mingle it with wormwood."</p>
               <p>"I love the orphan—have found a home for her, and visit her"——</p>
               <p>"You will visit her with vengeance, if she ever dares crucify your pride or
                  vanity."</p>
               <p>"What a spicy bit of human flesh and spirit I have found."</p>
               <p>"You really think yourself magnanimous. Your vanity needs to be put to the
                  torture. It is an <emph>easy</emph> virtue for <emph>you</emph> to feed your enemy
                  when he is a-hungered or athirst, because you know yourself strong, and your enemy
                  weak. What if you yourself were ahungered or athirst, and your enemy tantalizing
                  you with a mighty torture, because you were weak and he was strong? It is not
                     <emph>easy</emph> to forgive the enemy who exults in the ruin he wantonly
                  flings upon you. Suppose yourself a widow."</p>
               <p>"Not a supposable case—couldn't begin to do it."</p>
               <p>"Suppose yourself an orphan—penniless, miserable, forlorn—with a
                     <emph>heart</emph> gone mad with hunger and thirst for human sympathy—with an
                  intellect famishing on husks, till you <emph>know</emph> it to be daily
                  degenerating—going toward the bottomless, and dragging with it your moral nature,
                  which, as it descends, gazes upward with an infinite longing for purity and truth.
                  Suppose your <emph>enemy</emph> comes garbed in strength and beauty, and offers
                  you sweet poison, calling it <emph>love</emph>—trampling proudly on your weary
                  heart, weary long ago with its mad struggle with temptation—so deathly weary it is
                  almost ready to walk any path of misery down to its terrible end, so that the
                  grave is there!"</p>
               <p>"What strange words the siren has found."</p>
               <p>"Would it be <emph>easy</emph> to <emph>overcome</emph> evil with good while your
                  heart was writhing under the foot of that enemy?"</p>
               <p>"Have you ever found such an enemy?"</p>
               <p>"Never. There are many so tempted, however."</p>
               <p>"To them I could only say, 'There hath no temptation taken you but such as is
                     <emph>common</emph> to man; but God is faithful, and will not suffer you to be
                  tempted above what you are able, but with the temptation will also give strength
                  that you may be able to bear it.'"</p>
               <p>In a day of bitter temptation Mag heard those words again.</p>
               <p>"Do you <emph>know</emph> that doctrine to be true, or do you take the testimony
                  of others? If it is true, <emph>we are safe!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"I found it in the Bible, child."</p>
               <p>"What if that Bible is a glorious lie?"</p>
               <p>"You are getting on dangerous ground; it will crumble under your feet, and you
                  feet, and you will have no foundation."</p>
               <p>"So I fear, but I was forced there. I did not go willingly, I only ask a
                  legitimate question. Can you not answer it? I hope you are not as much frightened
                  as our pious clergyman. He is so shocked at the audacity and sacrilege of the
                  question, that he will not tell a miserable questioner whether there are answers
                  to such queries, though I have no doubt there are very satisfactory ones, if one
                  could only find them."</p>
               <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6426-00000085"/>
               <p>"I will talk with you as much as you please on all these things to-morrow, or some
                  day. Now I am impatient to introduce you to my sis. Will you go with me and call
                  on her? Aunt Emma says, come and spend the evening."</p>
               <p>"Where is Frank?"</p>
               <p>"Doing the devout to Lizzie. But what has that to do with my question? I am
                  shockingly jealous of Frank, anyway."</p>
               <p>"I am really thankful to hear it."</p>
               <p>"Will you go with me now? Lizzy is wild to see you."</p>
               <p>"I'll ask Aunt Lina."</p>
               <p>"There's a good child. Go and ask her this minute."</p>
               <p>Mag would not acknowledge to herself that she was delighted to be ordered in this
                  style, and to <emph>obey</emph> such commands. It was the woman in her nature that
                  longed to be controlled, that loved to acknowledge a superior, and loved to be
                  conquered, even when the will was exerting itself to the utmost against the
                  victor. There was a heavenly luxury in such submission, and for the time Mag
                  abandoned herself to the luxury.</p>
               <p>They spent the evening at the mansion of Dr. Ross. Frank and Alec extemporized a
                  soirée to entertain their Cousin Lizzy with the New England beaux and belles.</p>
               <p>Josie Newton was there, and almost in despair at Alec's devotion to Lizzy. Frank
                  volunteered his services to comfort her, asking Mag's advice about the propriety
                  of the thing.</p>
               <p>"Josie is in forty panics! It would be a pious act to relieve her distress. Shall
                  I try to distinguish myself by feeding her with bon-bons, to-night? I intend to do
                  it. May I, Mag? It shall be linked sweetness, <emph>long</emph> drawn out! You'll
                     <emph>let</emph> me, Mag?"</p>
               <p>"Behave yourself, Frank!"</p>
               <p>"Yeth, ma'am!" And Frank screwed up his countenance into an expression of amiable
                  gravity, and was soon discussing the literary and romantic, expatiating on the
                  glories of travel.</p>
               <p>Josie had a <emph>young lady's</emph> taste for all.</p>
               <p>"I am so anxious to live in Italy," she said. "It would be <emph>so nice</emph> to
                  dream, as Byron dreamed, under the walls of the Coliseum. It would be so charming
                  to spend a season at Rome."</p>
               <p>"Or Patagonia, or Hottentot-Land, or the Cannibal Islands, suggested Frank.</p>
               <p>"Oh, when I travel in Europe, as Madame Le Vert does, I am sure my soul will
                  expand to five times its present size," she continued with enthusiasm.</p>
               <p>"What Madame Le Vert saw was in her soul, not in Europe. Don't go, Josie, if it is
                  to affect your soul in that manner. What could you do with such an enormous
                  appendage. Our insignificant little souls would be in despair. Mine, not being an
                  india-rubber article, could never stretch enough to comprehend it."</p>
               <p>The lady was utterly oblivious of everything but the dazzling glory of her own
                  remarks. She went on:</p>
               <p>"It would be so romantic to live in a gondola with a poet."</p>
               <p>"But I have always understood that poets were not good for food. I, for one,
                  should go in for the 'goodies.' I should want the poet highly seasoned with
                  champagne, oysters, and arrangements, or, in my estimation, the gondola life would
                  be a miserable affair."</p>
               <p>Frank looked very much concerned at the prospect.</p>
               <p>"Ah, Mr. Frank, I am afraid you are envious, not being yourself a poet," was
                  Josie's next apropos remark.</p>
               <p>"But there is such an overflow of the poetic element in you, that it is absolutely
                  inspiring. You will soon make me a poet whether I wish or not, and then look out
                  for a sonnet to those azure eyes, so like the skies—to a golden curl of the
                  fairest girl, or a loose lock from those eye-brows and lashes. The rhyme wouldn't
                  come by inspiration to 'lashes,' but I might find 'flashes' in the dictionary.
                  Look out for the sonnet in the next paper."</p>
               <p>Josie's spirits rose and fluttered; she blushed and simpered, and Frank afterward
                  told Mag that "he congratulated himself on having spent an evening in cultivating
                  the spirit of self-denial and long-suffering. He had endeavored to make a mortal
                  happy by a spirit of self-sacrifice, truly praiseworthy, and had succeeded in
                  putting her into <emph>fits</emph> of ecstasies."</p>
               <p>The village <foreign xml:lang="FRA">élite</foreign> amused themselves by arranging
                  tableaux and acting charades.</p>
               <p>Lizzy Moore appeared as a Sultana, reclining amid a group of village beauties for
                  attendants. It was a lovely picture—the proudly curved lips wreathed in languid
                  scorn—the haughty grace of the drooping lashes—the pearl and coral of the rarely
                  smiling mouth—the limbs breathing repose in the exquisite molding of neck, arms
                  and fingers.<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6426-00000086"/> Mag saw it all, for she
                  had a seeing eye to discern human loveliness.</p>
               <p>"We have a request to make of you, Mr. Moore," said she to Charlie, after
                  consulting with the group.</p>
               <p>"Make it music to mine ears by utterance, Whip-poor-will, it shall be granted to
                  the half of my kingdom."</p>
               <p>"The ladies propose that the cadet make his appearance in full military
                  dress."</p>
               <p>Charlie demurred, but at last departed to make his toilet. Presently a message
                  came to Mag. He must see her in the ante-room.</p>
               <p>"Magdalene, my heart fails me; you will be obliged to give me yours for the
                  occasion—the one <emph>I</emph> gave you; this one afflicts me with its modesty.
                  Have pity on my burning blushes. <emph>You</emph> must introduce me to that array
                  of beauty, and support me by the dignity of your presence." It was Mag's turn to
                  demur.</p>
               <p>"Your audacity here counterbalances your modesty."</p>
               <p>"I forgive the wicked insinuation, in consideration of the lips that utter it.
                  Nothing but your presence, little mocking-bird, can possibly give me courage to
                  pass the fiery ordeal—that battery of flashing glances. Positively I cannot, shall
                  not, and <emph>will</emph> not go alone." And Charlie laid her hand upon his
                  arm.</p>
               <p>"The great Mogul has spoken!"</p>
               <p>"Eve! Turning rebel! To-morrow I must teach you submission—give you lessons on the
                  sublimity of the doctrine of <emph>obedience.</emph> You do not yet appreciate the
                  prime doctrine of Jesuitism—<emph>obedience</emph> to the commands of
                     <emph>superior officers.</emph> You will be a rare Jesuit when you learn to
                     <emph>submit</emph> gracefully. I shall give only reasonable commands."</p>
               <p>"You are offering a premium on disobedience. You make it hard to obey."</p>
               <p>"Magdalene, will you please introduce me?"</p>
               <p>"With pleasure, Lieutenant Moore!"</p>
               <p>They walked in, as Frank expressed it, with "amazing assumacy," and Mag introduced
                  to the élite—</p>
               <p>"Lieutenant Charles Atherton Moore, of the United States Army—a gentleman who, on
                  account of his audacity, is worthy to be Sultan of the East, or Emperor of all the
                  Russias."</p>
               <p>"Ladies and gentlemen, the Sultana of the East—the Empress of all the Russias!"
                  responded Charlie.</p>
               <p>They saluted the company with great sang-froid, and Mag turned in an aside to
                  Charlie:</p>
               <p>"Was that really impromptu?"</p>
               <p>"I've studied on it a year! It was <emph>originally</emph> suggested by my present
                  inspiration."</p>
               <p>Lizzy was watching them with Frank. The two superintended Charlie and Mag with
                  great interest.</p>
               <p>"I declare I am proud of brother," said Lizzy. "His epaulettes become him
                  splendidly; and the lady is more becoming to him than the epaulettes."</p>
               <p>"And I am proud of Mag," responded Frank. "She is immensely teased and annoyed
                  just now, but carrying it off bravely. I should like to see her battling with the
                  world once. She doesn't begin to know herself yet. There is a deal of nonsense to
                  be taken out of her, and then she will make a superb woman. Let her be once at bay
                  with mankind, and she would play a high and desperate, if not rash game. I believe
                  she could dare angels and demons!"</p>
               <p>"I would like to watch those two still further. We must <emph>call them
                  out</emph>—get them to act Romeo and Juliet! Will she do it?"</p>
               <p>"She is in a mood for anything now."</p>
               <p>And Charlie and Mag did perform Romeo and Juliet, with original and extempore
                  variations.</p>
               <p>Romeo knelt on one knee by her side, and as he fathomed her averted eyes, he
                  whispered: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l rend="ti-4">"I am afraid,</l>
                        <l>Being in night, all this is but a dream,</l>
                        <l>Too flattering sweet to be substantial!</l>
                        <l>How silver sweet sound lovers' tongues by night!"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Frank and Lizzy applauded the action and expression.</p>
               <p>"Modesty is a great <emph>art</emph> in a gentleman," said Lizzy.</p>
               <p>"The greatest of a lady's <emph>accomplishments,</emph>" responded Frank. "We must
                  change the circumstances for these actors. We do not see such plays every day, and
                  must improve the opportunities. They are <emph>star</emph>-actors—have both genius
                  and inspiration."</p>
               <p>He called to Mag.</p>
               <p>"You must make arrangements with the ladies to-night, to have a pic-nic at Glenlyn
                  Falls for Lizzy's benefit, tomorrow."</p>
               <p>The pic-nic came off accordingly. Lizzie was intoxicated with nature at Glenlyn.
                  The flowers went crazy with<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6426-00000087"/> blossoming,
                  and the birds with singing, over the moss-covered rocks in the mountain gorge,
                  through which the waters had run for—how many ages? The waters had worn a huge
                  chasm, so broad and deep, as to puzzle the geologists, before the time of Hugh
                  Miller. The ravine was shaded with gigantic forest trees, and far away, down by
                  the green sward, cool, plashing waters were running; and there, Mag said the weary
                  could sleep and think of heaven; could dream of bathing the fever of hot hearts in
                  the crystal waters of the River of Life, till the pulse of passion went down
                  forever.</p>
               <p>The village nymphs were all busy; they flitted over the rocks, and darted among
                  the trees, spreading the moss-table. Some concocted lemonades by a spring in the
                  hillside, whilst others placed ice-creams, blanc-mange, and an endless series of
                  cakes, pies, meats and fruits upon the cloth. May Burton busied her little fingers
                  in gathering bouquets of wild flowers and leaves, that blushed, and nodded, and
                  coquetted to each other, as gracefully as the human flowers. Nelly Brandon
                  arranged original poetry for Ralph Burton's unoriginal music, and the rocks echoed
                  back all the music, and the choruses, and the laughter. Then there was a feast of
                  reason and a flow of soul; speeches, toasts and sentiments, from military
                  students, law students, and students of human hearts; and then the groups
                  scattered themselves over the rocks, and down by the waters, and splashed spray,
                  and foam, and rainbows up into heaven's sunshine, and watched the rainbows as they
                  quickly vanished, each one gone forever.</p>
               <p>"Our by-play is commencing, Lizzy," said Frank, pointing to Mag, who stood upon
                  the precipice, where the waters were pouring over the ledge. "No harm in watching
                  the actors; we shall see only the pantomime."</p>
               <p>Charlie Moore approached her, and two forms were revealed against the sky—the man
                  made in the image of his Maker—the woman formed from man. They were then but
                  little lower than the angels, and capable of a destiny far nobler, if only
                     <emph>true</emph> to the divine within them, while learning the God-appointed
                  lesson set them on earth.</p>
               <p>"Will you go down into the abyss with me, Charles Moore?" she asked, as he came
                  up, glancing into his face with a smile.</p>
               <p>"Not yet, little Eve. I will <emph>live</emph> for you a while longer. We have not
                  exhausted life here yet. The present satisfies me now; but if you ruin our
                  Paradise, and are driven from Eden, I will go with you. Death with you will be a
                  thousand-fold dearer than life without you." And he took her hand, as if to go
                  down to the abyss. "You have not yet told me you love me, Magdalene Barclay. Tell
                  me so now. Do not deny it again."</p>
               <p>"You <emph>know</emph> I love you!"</p>
               <p>"God bless you for your frank truthfulness. What do you mean by love, Zoë?"</p>
               <p>"More than many mortals dream—I mean that <emph>torture</emph> from your hands
                  would be sweeter than the boon of glory from any, or all others upon earth! I mean
                  that if I were doomed to die, and must die by slow torture, the anguish would be
                  bliss if administered by your hand, and <emph>you loved me!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Magdalene Barclay <emph>Moore!</emph> Soften your language. This passionate bliss
                  is agony; it is too keen. Yours is a strange nature—deep, and high, and
                  noble!"</p>
               <p>"You tremble to know its depths. There are few mortals who ever know the
                     <emph>deep</emph> meaning of the word love. Not one of all those radiant
                  creatures of earth, yonder, beneath the trees, and beside those streams, will ever
                  have the slightest conception of its meaning. They will never dream of fathoming
                  its depths. To the most of humanity, love is but a myth. The master-spirit does
                  not come to reveal it." <q>

               <p>"You will <emph>prove</emph> your love for me?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, by bidding you leave me forever on earth! Love is no habitant of earth! They
                  tell us there is a better world than this, where hope never deceives us, and love
                  never mocks us."</p>

                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000088"/> words of yesterday? What if the Bible, which
                  teaches of that bright world, is a <emph>glorious lie?</emph>"</p>
               <p>Mag looked up wistfully—foolish dreamer!</p>
               <p>"If you wait till we reach that world before you <emph>prove</emph> your love for
                  me, yet still tell me you love me; your words are a <emph>magnificent
                  lie.</emph>"</p>
               <p>A look of inexpressible pain imprinted itself upon every lineament of Mag's face.
                  Poor child! she thought herself in earnest. He read the language of those wistful
                  features. She lifted her eyes very modestly to his—the sad, pleading look touched
                  his heart.</p>
               <p>"Dear little Mag, forgive me! I do not know what strange, life-philosophy you have
                  learned; but this I know, I am a man, not an angel. My nature demands an earthly
                  love, not a heavenly one. I could find no use even for <emph>angelic</emph> love
                  at present. God has given us—you and I—<emph>physical</emph> natures, vital with
                  passion, whose cravings demand to be satisfied with earthly love. You have given
                  me your rare spiritual and intellectual self; but you must give me your beautiful,
                  physical self, also. God made us for each other. Be my wife—my Eve on earth. Do
                  not deny me this joy on earth. Let us make sure of this happiness! If not, and the
                  Bible is a lie, and there is no hereafter, 'what thrice-mocked fools we are!'"</p>
               <p>Mag turned deathly pale with emotion.</p>
               <p>"You mean, eat, drink, and be merry, for to-morrow we die."</p>
               <p>"I mean, <q>

               </p>
               <p>Mag paused, and said gently, "I believe I can bear no more of this now. You told
                  me, yesterday, you would tell me about that Bible, sometime. Will you do it
                  now?"</p>
               <p>"Not now—not here. Lizzy and Frank are watching us; we will go to them now, and
                  talk of these things tomorrow, when that pale face looks less sorrowful."</p>
               <p>One chief source of human sorrow is "the expecting too much of this world and the
                  inhabitants thereof." Mag had a pure woman's too lofty ideal; it came to earth
                  afterward.</p>

               <p>LIEUTENANT CHARLES ATHERTON MOORE, U.S.A., found this wooing an epicurean luxury.
                  He appreciated fully the charm of forbidden fruit; it had a delicious flavor; he
                  did not doubt that he should gather the racy harvest. <q>

                  mountains. Yes, he should gather the fruit in its rare and spicy ripeness, and
                  garner it in his heart. He was willing to bide his time, but he must recreate his
                  intellect by learning Mag's peculiar culture. He was a studied epicurean; he would
                  not exhaust his pleasures; he would not quaff the cup of life <emph>too</emph>
                  eagerly; some precious drops might overflow, if he lifted the beaker too hastily
                  to his lips—the dead earth receive the treasure; he must have the goblet in its
                  glorious prime; he would not wait till the foam had subsided and the crystal
                  sparkle fled; not wait till but stale dregs remained; not one drop or bubble
                  should escape from the beaker untasted. God knew he would not poison the draught,
                  if he could; and he added to his reverie, Thank God, he <emph>could</emph> not, if
                  he would! He must and would drain every atom of bliss in the intoxicating
                  draught—drain it to the lees.</p>
               <p>And Mag. We have said that she was morbid spiritually, not intellectually or
                  physically. Her sensitive spirit had opened to her many an avenue of suffering,
                  undreamed of by those who had tortured her. Morbid—aye, the disease was hidden,
                  but it lay deep; and woman-like, she fostered it. She fancied she was taking
                  lessons of the Spartan boy, who smiled with the concealed reptile tearing at his
                  vitals. She fancied that the chords of her being, bruised and torn, were vibrating
                  over bleeding and putrefying wounds, mortifications of flesh and spirit. She had
                  been upbraided with<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6426-00000089"/> her poverty and
                  orphanage—with her pride and ingratitude; when she had listened in tearless
                  silence, they called her heartless, and told her that it would have been better
                  for herself and them if she had never been born. Her heart responded "Amen!" but
                  she was not responsible for the mistake of her birth; she had not asked for being;
                  alas, she could not resign it!</p>
               <p>Those who tortured her never dreamed of the cureless wounds they inflicted. They
                  were kind-hearted souls—would never have wronged her willingly; but Mag was not of
                  their order; they could not comprehend her; and so, unaccountably and ignorantly
                  to them, their heartless and careless words penetrated to the fountains of her
                  life, and poisoned its waters.</p>
               <p>"Better if she had never been born! Yes, the boon of life was paltry for good—more
                  than worthless—mighty for evil. Why, why, why had God done it? What was God doing
                  with her? Was there, indeed, as the <emph>Bible</emph> said, the one God of the
                  universe—the God of love? or were there not, as <emph>Nature</emph> taught, two
                  equal gods, one of good and one of evil? Or was there no God, but a blind
                  chance?"</p>
               <p>Alone she wandered in the wilderness of Doubt; taught, as a woman is ever taught
                  to think, by the sorrow in her heart; alone she wrestled with the tempter, when
                  her hours of temptation came. She felt a very Hagar in the desert; and yet, when
                  she would have burst her bonds, and fled even to the deserts for freedom forever,
                  an unseen angel perpetually whispered to her, to "return to her
                     <emph>mistress,</emph> submit herself to her <emph>bondage,</emph> and be
                     <emph>obedient</emph> till the end came." Her brain was pregnant with Ishmael
                     <emph>thoughts</emph>—wanderers and outcasts, but <emph>free.</emph> Every
                  man's hand was against them; they, too, were against every man—aye, and against
                  the God and the Man-God of the revealed Word.</p>
               <p>Lizzy and Frank went with Charlie and Mag over the mountains; and with their usual
                  discrimination and sympathetic insight, kept as far out of their way as possible.
                  It is a valuable accomplishment to seem unconscious of all we know.</p>
               <p>Mag proceeded in a silent reverie; Charlie broke the silence.</p>
               <p>"Enlighten me as to the mighty subject on the mind of the philosopher."</p>
               <p>"The woman question, of course, Lieutenant Moore."</p>
               <p>"And you are pondering the doctrine of <emph>obedience.</emph> I told you that
                  your principles needed training on that point, and I promised you instruction and
                  encouragement. I am glad to discover, on your part, evidence of a desire for
                  improvement. There is pressing need of it on that subject."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, commence your lesson. Be sure, however, that you have tested its
                     <emph>truth.</emph> I want truth, not <emph>opinion.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Paul's instructions, on that point, are very explicit: 'Let the woman learn in
                  silence, with all subjection. Suffer not a woman to usurp authority over the man,
                  but to be in silence.'"</p>
               <p>"Continue your quotation, if you please, and I shall take issue with Paul—if I
                  can," Mag said.</p>
               <p>"For Adam was <emph>not deceived,</emph> but the woman <emph>being deceived,
                     sinned.'</emph> Sit down, Eve, upon this green knoll, and let me hear you take
                  issue with Paul."</p>
               <p>"The sentence contains bad logic. Sin is sin, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">per
                     se</foreign>—it lies in the <emph>motive</emph> of action. Eve sinned from a
                     <emph>right</emph> motive. '<emph>Being deceived,</emph>' she believed the
                  serpent, when he promised her, 'Ye shall not surely die; ye shall be as gods,
                     <emph>knowing good and evil.</emph>' It is a glorious thing to have all
                  knowledge and life. Eve desired life and knowledge; she <emph>believed</emph> the
                  serpent; she proved the sincerity of her belief by her act. In the
                     <emph>motive</emph> lies the guilt. The root of all evil, then, must be traced
                  back beyond the mother of mankind, to the First Cause, who, 'from before the
                  foundation of the world,' <emph>predestined</emph> sin, and its offspring,
                  misery."</p>
               <p>"Your <emph>premises</emph> are wrong, Magdalene, and I shall deny them. Sin is
                  not sin, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">per se.</foreign> Sin is a transgression of God's
                     <emph>law.</emph> Where there is no law, there is no sin. This same Bible,
                  which you have placed a criminal at the bar, teaches that the nations who have not
                     <emph>law</emph> shall perish without law. God had commanded Eve not to eat of
                  the tree of knowledge, and she, with the <emph>free will</emph> which He had given
                  her, disobeyed His known <emph>law,</emph> and so the black curse of sin came upon
                  earth."</p>
               <p>"But Adam's crime was greater than the crime of Eve. What might not have been the
                  consequences if he had refused to eat? Adam was not even <emph>deceived;</emph>
                  knowing his full guilt, and its terrible consequences, with the deliberate consent
                  of his <emph>free will,</emph> he committed the sin. With<pb n="178-179"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000090"/> good to whom? On Eve and her daughters have
                  descended the curse!" said Mag.</p>
               <p>"Cui bono? -Adam sinned for love's sweet sake. God recognized the grandeur of
                  heaven's own atmosphere of <emph>love</emph> on earth, when Adam made the
                  sacrifice. Would I not choose a thousand deaths with you, to a paradise without
                  you? The Man-God taught by word and self-sacrifice, 'Greater love hath no man than
                  this, that a man lay down his life for his friend.' Would you not die for me?" he
                  replied.</p>
               <p>"That motive, ascribed to Adam, we must think a license of the poets; for, take
                  notice, when called upon by God to account for his act, he was so anxious to
                  palliate his own guilt, that he threw all the blame upon the beloved; and
                  therefore it was, that upon her devoted head fell the greater curse. From Eve down
                  to her latest daughter the curse has descended. Here is another mystery," Mag
                  answered.</p>
               <p>"Adam but answered God with the simple, honest truth, 'The woman gave me, and I
                  did eat.' God knew it. He could not deceive God. Had he said less, he would not
                  have spoken the whole truth; had he said more, he might have been a deceiver in
                  the eyes of One who knew every thought of his heart," Moore added.</p>
               <p>"But the great <emph>mystery</emph> that Christian geologists have failed to
                  solve! Hugh Miller's 'Testimony of the Rocks' has not done it: death came into the
                  world by <emph>sin.</emph> Eve's curse came by Eve's sin. How came her curse to
                  descend upon the animal creation? How came it into existence—<emph>birth and
                     death</emph>—ages before she was created? Unless the records—the revelations
                  written upon the hills and in the hearts of the mountains—are all glorious lies,
                  death has been upon the earth since ages and ages before Eden was planted and
                  human love had learned its deep bliss and agony; Can you solve the mystery?"</p>
               <p>"I can wait God's time, and He himself will solve it, Zoë"</p>
               <p>"But if there is no God?"</p>
               <p>Charlie looked at her earnestly.</p>
               <p>"Who or what taught you all this skepticism?"</p>
               <p>"You have not answered my question; but I will answer yours by saying, it is a
                  soul-sickness that all mortals are liable to take once in a lifetime, in matters
                  of religion as well as friendship. The disease comes in youth, and there should be
                  a remedy adapted to the youthful skeptic. Have I not told you that I <emph>doubt
                     you also,</emph> and your power over me for <emph>good;</emph> though I know
                  you can do me <emph>evil,</emph> I doubt the power of love on earth for good."</p>
               <p>"'He who has never doubted yet, has never yet believed,'" replied Charlie. "But
                  your soul-physician has been careless. You should have persuaded your shepherd to
                  try inoculation as a preventive."</p>
               <p>"The poet tells us, that the germs of death lie deep in our natures, so that with
                  our first breath of life we inhale disease and commence dying. Perhaps I have
                  cultivated those baleful plants, because there was intoxication in the odor. I
                  have gathered the poisonous blossoms with rare joy. At least, I have been the fool
                  that 'hath said in his heart, there is no God."</p>
               <p>"No God! And you ignore that all-powerful argument from design. There are
                  undeniable evidences of design in the universe; therefore there must have been a
                  designer."</p>
               <p>"If it proves anything, it proves <emph>too much.</emph> We see all creation
                  groaning and travailing in pain together. We see men endowed with passions
                  powerful for evil. We see sin and iniquity trampling down and crushing out all
                  that is noble. We see the good and pure and noble perishing, and no God saves them
                  when they cry to him for help. We see the wicked flourishing like a green
                  bay-tree. If virtue receives a reward, we do not know it in this world; if vice
                  receives punishment, it is not often upon earth. We see men go down by passion, to
                  worse than brutal degradation, and whole nations sinking to barbarism, instead of
                  rising to purity. Therefore, the argument from design only proves the existence of
                     <emph>two equal Gods—one of good, and one of evil!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"You are right. Natural religion proves this, and <emph>no more.</emph> The one
                  God—the God of Love—saw this, and saw the necessity of a revelation further than
                  this; and, therefore, it was that prophets, priests and kings were commissioned by
                  him to write the Bible, that men might <emph>know</emph> him as a <emph>God of
                     Love.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"You <emph>believe</emph> this?"</p>
               <p>"To me the argument from design is full of beauty. It must have been a beneficent
                  being who formed this hand of yours—adapted it to so many graceful purposes—tinted
                  it with rosy blood and fair flesh, and gave it its thrilling pulses. As I touch
                  these rounded fingers, and feel the electric chord vibrate to my heart's core, I
                  believe that<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6426-00000091"/> God <emph>designed</emph>
                  you for my happiness and blessing. No, Magdalene, do not withdraw your hand. I
                  claim it as my own. Do not avert your eyes from mine; a God of Love gave them
                  their beauty—adapted them, by a wonderful mechanism, to his element of light—for
                  what were light without the seeing eye, or the eye without its medium of light?
                  God fitted them for each other, as he <emph>designed,</emph> also, that the
                  beautiful spirit looking out of your eye should have power over me, and fill my
                  whole responsive nature with joy—intense joy. God gave us the answering thrill of
                  spirit acting on spirit. God <emph>designed</emph> our natures for love. God made
                  us for love, and for each other, Magdalene."</p>
               <p>"You <emph>believe</emph> the Bible came from God?"</p>
               <p>"Why should I not? It is a happiness to believe it."</p>
               <p>"It were a happiness if one <emph>could</emph> believe it."</p>
               <p>"What fault do you find with it?"</p>
               <p>"The <emph>woman question</emph> for one thing. Eve is the only responsible woman
                  mentioned—the only one who is made accountable for sin. In all the sins of the
                  Samsons and Davids, no fault is found with woman. In Jacob's time, woman's rights
                  were in terrible confusion."</p>
               <p>Charlie laughed. "And Jacob, poor fellow, poor fellow! Were you not sorry for him,
                  Mag? Serving for Rachel and receiving Leah."</p>
               <p>"Poor Leah!" said Mag. "Unfortunate, weak-minded Leah!"</p>
               <p>"Truly, Magdalene, that was a strange arrangement. A woman to marry a man without
                  his knowledge. Could you, in these days, be liberal enough to do it, under any
                  combination of circumstances? Poor Jacob! Men of the present day, husbands of
                     <emph>one</emph> strong-minded, and, especially, of one
                  <emph>weak</emph>-minded woman, find the other <emph>half</emph> unmanageable;
                  what then must have been the condition of the patriarch, who found himself
                  quadrupled or quintupled,—which was it—in spite of himself? Leah commenced
                  presenting him with wives. Rachel followed her example. Jacob was submissive—took
                  the Bilhahs and the Zilpahs, and seemed thankful. Was it <emph>right,</emph>
                  Mag?"</p>
               <p>Mag opened her eyes in wide astonishment. Charlie went on.</p>
               <p>"If sin is sin, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">per se,</foreign> your opinion would be a
                  dilemma. God's <emph>law</emph> made it <emph>right</emph> to those Israelites, if
                  the Bible is true. Christ's <emph>law</emph> makes it a sin for the Mormons, if
                  the New Testament is true."</p>
               <p>"You are more daring than I in your discussions, Charlie."</p>
               <p>"The woman question was in an uncivilized state, in those Bible times, so the
                     <emph>free-thinkers</emph> say; and they <emph>will</emph> say it, even if the
                  over-good and careful are shocked. There is no use in ignoring the fact, or
                  shrinking from it. It does not remedy the matter to call these men scoffers and
                  devils because they do it. No use in taking the course that some over-pious
                  clergymen take, of concealing the strong arguments against the Bible, because men
                  love darkness rather than light, and <emph>will</emph> hear all that can be said
                  against revelation, yet shut their eyes and heart when God's truth is laid before
                  them. Let such men have opportunity to know the truth, the whole truth, and
                  nothing but the truth, and take the consequences of their willful blindness."</p>
               <p>"Have you studied theology, Charlie?"</p>
               <p>"Read up a little with Dr. Ross, of Huntsville; Schleiermacher; Muller on Original
                  Sin; and once got hold of a little pamphlet of Prof. Shedd's, of Andover, on the
                  same, that was an original thing. Besides these, the standard text-books;
                  Olshausen, Tholuck, Henstenberg, and so on, and so forth, too numerous to
                  mention."</p>
               <p>"You are a marvel of literary taste!" Mag rose and surveyed him.</p>
               <p>"Those are my sentiments precisely; and my taste approves entirely of the literary
                  pursuits of a little madcap, skeptical girl, who stands before me now, and dares
                  think that the women of the Bible were not civilized."</p>
               <p>"Go on, Lieutenant Moore. Your conversation delights me."</p>
               <p>"She has dared question the propriety of calling King David a model of virtue, who
                  took the lovely ewe-lamb of Uriah, the Bathsheba from her bath, to make her the
                  mother of that model of wisdom—King Solomon—who, in turn, inherited his father's
                  penchant for <emph>fair</emph> ladies, and also—if we may judge him by his Song of
                  Songs to the daughters of Pharaoh—he loved those who were 'black but comely,' and
                  not wisely, but too well."</p>
               <p>"Charles Atherton Moore, you are committing sacrilege!"</p>
               <p>"Not in your estimation, little Eve, if you believe the Bible a glorious lie! You
                  dare question its inspiration, and I admire your daring. You see no gallantry
                     or<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6426-00000092"/> righteousness in the conduct of
                  Lot when he tried to appease the passions of the mob, who were clamoring for the
                  blood of his angel visitants, by offering them his two daughters as a precious
                  ragout. It was before the days of chivalry—before the times when Virginius, in the
                  Roman Forum, plunged the dagger into the heart of <emph>his</emph> daughter to
                  save her."</p>
               <p>"I am past all astonishment!"</p>
               <p>"I thought so! There is many a sinner whom I have met, who does not scruple to
                  express the same opinions concerning the customs of God's chosen people. You
                  remember that Levite who gave his wife to the sons of Belial, and when he found
                  her dead upon the threshold the next morning, cut her into twelve parts, and sent
                  her to the twelve tribes, calling for vengeance! Time would fail to notice
                  Abraham's policy in preserving his wife, who, by the way, was his sister, to marry
                  whom in these days would be sin, a <emph>law</emph> having since been passed,
                  forbidding a man to marry his sister. I am grateful that you are not my sister,
                  for I cannot marry Lizzy now."</p>
               <p>"Toward what does all this tend? I do not see the point, and I feel
                     <emph>unsafe</emph> while listening."</p>
               <p>"Not if you deny the Bible. No need of mentioning to you those items of marriage,
                  Cain and Abel, with their sisters—you are probably skeptical on the unity of the
                  races, with Nott, Gliddon, et id omne genus. And the <emph>right</emph> and
                     <emph>wrong</emph> of marrying at all, is merely a myth, but for the Bible. No
                  other authority recognized, I believe, for establishing the institution of
                  marriage; no account ever given of its origin, but that one of Adam and Eve, in
                  Eden, said to have been sanctioned and blessed by God. You doubt the Bible—doubt
                  marriage; put off ours to a hereafter, of which we have no knowledge, but for the
                  Bible, and that tells us that marriage is only an earthly institution; for in
                  heaven there is neither marrying nor giving in marriage! Oh, Magdalene!"</p>
               <p>"Go on, Lieutenant Moore; you surely have not finished yet."</p>
               <p>"You doubt the Bible; have questioned God's justice, wisdom and mercy. You have
                  wondered <emph>why</emph> the curse fell upon the <emph>children</emph> of Ham,
                  who committed no sin. We of the South believe that curse to be the curse of
                     <emph>slavery</emph>—given as a <emph>curse,</emph> not a
                     <emph>blessing.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"And we of the icy North laugh at the idea as absurd."</p>
               <p>"Let those laugh who win. <emph>If</emph> it be a truth, a laugh cannot make it
                  false; that Canaan should be a servant of servants to his brethren. We, of the
                  South believe it, perhaps because it is our interest to do so; to us it is a
                  strong proof of the truth of the Bible; a fulfillment of Noah's prophecy, or
                  curse. Let those laugh who win, so that they do not lose <emph>love</emph> by
                  it!</p>
               <p>"You have questioned the justice and propriety of Abraham's marriage with Hagar,
                  and his <emph>right</emph> to send her out with <emph>his</emph> child Ishmael,
                  into the desert to perish, because Sarah in her passion of jealousy turned against
                  the slave she had given him as his wife. You question the fitting and beautiful,
                  in the angel's command to the deserted, desolate Hagar, before this: 'Hagar,
                     <emph>Sarah's maid'</emph> not Abraham's wife, 'return to thy
                     <emph>mistress,</emph> and <emph>submit</emph> thyself under her hands.' We of
                  the South believe, that God's <emph>command</emph> made slavery and polygamy both,
                     <emph>right</emph> to Abraham. You wonder <emph>why</emph> it was permitted
                  that every man's hand should be against Ishmael, and his hand against every man.
                  You wonder <emph>why</emph> the Israelites were God's <emph>chosen</emph>
                  people—why, after they were <emph>chosen,</emph> and God had done wonderful
                  miracles for their deliverance from bondage, he permitted them either to fall into
                  barbarism, or the ten and a half tribes to be lost from the face of the earth; why
                  he <emph>permitted</emph> the remnant of his chosen people to become a hissing, a
                  by-word, and a reproach among all nations, for you know an omnipotent God might
                  have prevented it. You wonder why He delivered them from slavery, yet made it
                  right by the <emph>laws</emph> He gave, that they should have bondmen, called in
                  those laws their <emph>money.</emph> You wonder <emph>why,</emph> GOD
                     <emph>hardened</emph> Pharaoh's heart, and then poured upon him those
                  tremendous curses, the ten plagues, and at last, overthrew him and his army in the
                  Red Sea. Yet for all this, where are now the <emph>chosen people,</emph> and
                  why—why—why?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, why, Charles Atherton Moore? Do you believe the Bible to be the revelation
                  of God?"</p>
               <p>"Look at that butterfly, Zoë; how its gold-dusted wings glitter in the sunshine! A
                  few days ago it was a brown earth-worm, and wove itself a prison; at last, weary
                  of its solitude, the chrysalis burst its bonds, and soared away toward heaven, and
                  freedom."</p>
               <p>"You are one magnificent man! I wish you were my brother!"</p>

               <p>"Oh, no! After all, a marriage <emph>ceremony</emph> does not constitute marriage,
                  and we are already one. You are now my wife; God, therefore, predestined it, from
                  before the foundations of the world!"</p>
               <p>"Do you believe the Bible to be God's word?"</p>
               <p>"You are like the chrysalis of which we were speaking; you have woven your own
                  prison, and called it Doubting Castle. I will help you burst your bonds, and we
                  will go together to freedom."</p>
               <p>"I am free. God gave me freedom—if there is a God!"</p>
               <p>"Then, little butterfly, I must entice you to come down and light upon my hand.
                  You will come of your own <emph>free will?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Yes, when I come at all—I shall come no nearer in this world."</p>
               <p>"You cannot tear yourself from me. We are already one."</p>
               <p>"Do you believe the Bible to be inspired of God?"</p>
               <p>"Whether <emph>I</emph> believe it or not, <emph>you</emph> believe it. You
                  believe in revelation, in defiance of reason. <emph>You</emph> believe the Bible
                  to contain infinite truth, which the finite reason, although itself a revelation
                  from God, can never compass. It is selfishness that doubts—our miserable
                  selfishness that wrestles with doubt, and makes us struggle so madly after
                     <emph>light.</emph> Pain and sorrow have taught you to think. When you are
                     <emph>happy,</emph> you will no longer doubt. When you will <emph>trust
                     me,</emph> and permit me to make your happiness, you will trust God also. Pain
                  and sorrow have their uses; they expand our natures—give them their deepest life.
                  They teach us of <emph>hell,</emph> too. We know the elements of the bottomless
                  pit, when we feel the steaming misery stifling us. We often doubt man—doubt our
                  own power to escape from influences that are dragging us down. We doubt God; but
                  in this world we do not doubt the power of evil. We <emph>know</emph> we have the
                  tempter in our hearts. But we <emph>do</emph> believe in God, whether we will or
                  not; we shall believe to the endless ages of eternity, in spite of ourselves. You,
                  little Mag, with your utmost effort, after your Puritan education, in this
                  Christian land, cannot escape from the influences that force you, by your
                  conscience, to believe in God and his holy Bible."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Charlie; you speak with a point. <emph>Why</emph> do <emph>you</emph>
                  believe in the Bible?"</p>
               <p>"For many, many reasons, you persevering little persecutor; always firstly,
                  because I <emph>desire to do it.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Not as the lost spirits who believe and tremble."</p>
               <p>"The Bible accounts for many otherwise unaccountable <emph>facts</emph> in the
                  history of nations. It accounts for the <emph>origin</emph> of sacrifices and
                  circumcision, among the chosen people; absurd customs, but for their Bible
                  history. I believe it on account of the known fulfillment of numerous prophecies,
                  all of which I have not time to mention. In Nineveh has recently been discovered a
                  monument to Jonah—the Jews, a by-word and reproach among all nations—the followers
                  of Mahomet, the unconquerable sons of the desert, children of Ishmael, their hands
                  against every man, and every man's hand against them. And <emph>slavery</emph> is
                  one of the strong arguments to convince <emph>me</emph> that the Bible is the
                  revelation of the one God. No other theory can account for the degradation of the
                  African race, but that they are the accursed descendants of Ham. The testimony of
                  other historians, slight as it is, confirms the testimony of Moses, as that of
                  Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus—and <emph>I believe it!</emph>—shall I go on?"</p>
               <p>"Go on, Lizzy and Frank will return presently."</p>
               <p>"No history but the Bible accounts for the division of time into the six days and
                  the Sabbath. This division has been found among all nations—to be accounted for
                  only as the Book accounts for it—<emph>God commanded it.</emph> The
                     <emph>holy</emph> institution of marriage, found among all nations, to be
                  accounted for only as the Book accounts for it, God instituted it in Eden. I
                  believe the Bible to be given by the inspiration of God, because no philosophy or
                  religion in the ages since Moses has given a system of morality so pure as that of
                  the Decalogue—or a morality not contained in the law said first to have been
                  written on tables of stone. I believe in the unity of races. I believe all
                  languages to have sprung from one language—that of Adam and Eve—because all
                  languages have been discovered to contain the same roots. And I believe that Adam
                  and Eve were the first parents of mankind. I believe that all that is glorious and
                  sublime in the philosophies and religions of the East sprung from one source—the
                  worship taught the children of men when the sons of God visited them, and angels
                  communed with mortals."</p>
               <p>"Those eastern religions have noble germs of thought."</p>
               <p>"The minds must have been noble that framed the<pb n="186-187"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000094"/> thoughts, and the language to express their
                  sublimity. Those in Confucius—the marriage of the perfect and imperfect—of heaven
                  and earth—of the two souls that form one man—one of which has the faculty of
                     <emph>feeling</emph>—(the woman?) and the other the faculty of
                     <emph>knowing</emph>"——</p>
               <p>"The man."</p>
               <p>"And 'by <emph>humility</emph> the man will be raised up!' Those Chinese have
                  derived glorious truths from some inspired source. Then the Persian Zendavesta,
                  with its worship of Ormudz and Ahiram—light and darkness—Gods of good and evil—of
                  whose power and beauty the sun and fire were the fittest types or emblems. The
                  wonderful Trinities, common to all religions—as of India, Persia, of Egypt—and the
                  wonderful resemblance of all their theories of the origin of the universe, to the
                  Hebrew account of the darkness brooding over the abyss at the dawn of creation. I
                  believe these religions all to have originated from the religion taught Adam by
                  the God of Love."</p>
               <p>"I see Lizzy and Frank. Please go on without delay."</p>
               <p>"For woman's sake, above all other reasons, I believe in the Bible. Not that in
                  the Old Testament she was ever treated as an accountable being—she was not. Even
                  Esther, Queen of Ahasuerus, acted solely under the command of her cousin Mordecai.
                  Not by any common persuasion could she be induced to risk herself to save her
                  people—not until Mordecai assured her that she would certainly die with her
                  people, did she dare attempt their rescue. Then came her pitiful wail, 'If I
                  perish, I perish!' Then the whole nation must fast and pray for her. With womanly
                  tears and trembling, that in you, Magdalene, would be considered cowardly, she
                  ventured at last into her king's presence, and her nation was saved. Esther and
                  Ruth are the model women of the Bible; the only ones who are said to manifest
                  noble <emph>strength</emph> of character. Their magnanimity will not compare with
                  characters of modern history, as the Joan of Arc—the Charlotte Corday—or even the
                  Josephine of France. Yet for woman's sake I believe in the Bible. Only where
                  Christian religion is honored is woman honored as man's mate and equal—as you are
                  my mate, my equal, and my destiny."</p>
               <p>"If I perish, I perish! Shall I ever know the <emph>deep</emph> meaning of those
                  words?"</p>
               <p>"If you do not, you will never know the deep sublimity of life, or the large
                  development that God intended for your soul. Be true to your pure woman's
                  nobility; be true to yourself when your hour comes for saying, 'If I perish, I
                  perish,' and God will preserve you!"</p>
               <p>That hour came to Mag, and Charles Moore was with her.</p>
               <p>"You speak strangely."</p>
               <p>"It is my hour of <emph>inspiration.</emph> My better nature with all its powers
                  is in full action. Not often in a lifetime shall I find an occasion or an
                  inspiration to rouse my faculties. The one I love has called out the
                     <emph>divinity</emph> within me. The time may come when I too shall be tempted
                  beyond refuge. You could be my tempter. You must not tempt me too far. I have a
                  most perfect physical nature."</p>
               <p>"I will pray for you always, Charlie. Your perfection of passion will teach you
                  rare lessons."</p>
               <p>"Passion will teach you rare things also, child of earth. You too will pass
                  through the ordeal—the burning, fiery furnace—but, like Nebuchadnezzar, you will
                  discover in the flames a form like the Son of God, who will preserve you
                  unscathed."</p>
               <p>"Like Nebuchadnezzar, I may descend to the earth and learn all the meaning of
                  degradation and humility, while feeding on dust and ashes."</p>
               <p>"Like the swan in the fable, you may stay in degradation with an inferior race
                  till your wings reveal themselves; then knowing yourself of a royal line you will
                  soar away to life and freedom."</p>
               <p>"Alas—alas! like the eagle of the fable, if of the royal lineage who sweep the
                  air, and gaze undazzled into the eye of the sun, to drink in its light and beauty,
                  it may be that grovelling with the earth-born shall so take the strength from the
                  eagle's wing, that it must perish on the earth that found and degraded its
                  pinion."</p>
               <p>Frank and Lizzy were listening to this peroration.</p>
               <p>"You are getting quite flighty, Mag," said Frank. "Don't soar so near the sun as
                  to scorch your wings; the consequences would be disastrous in the extreme. Take
                  warning from that little fellow in the myth, who melted his waxen wings and
                  splashed into the sea. You remember your old propensities in that line."</p>
               <p>"Frank and Lizzy look as if they had been breathing exhilarating gas," said
                  Charlie to Mag, in a tone of admiration.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Frank is certainly in one of his moods," responded<pb n="188-189"

                  obliged to say it or die. And, Charlie, you and I shall be obliged to listen while
                  he delivers himself, so we may prepare for it."</p>
               <p>But Frank may have another chapter for what he has to offer in the line of

                  the name of all that is ravishing, have you two been doing with each other? Your
                  eye is apocalyptic, and Frank seems fairly boiling with exuberance! Out with it,
                  Frank. We are able to bear it. We are prepared for anything."</p>
               <p>"I have not a doubt of it. You are looking through exuberant eyes. The ravishment

                  common-place mortals under natural circumstances, have been imbibing
                  philosophy."</p>
               <p>"Fresh from the fountain-head," added Lizzy, "from Socrates and Xantippe."</p>
               <p>"I converted Lizzy into a 'lion'-ess, and took her out to see the 'lions' of
                  Glenlyn—thought there might be reciprocated attractions. I took her first to our
                  quondam Master Socrates, for a dose of his philosophy."</p>
               <p>"And having witnessed the lives of Socrates and Xantippe, I shall forever be able
                  to appreciate the 'beautiful;' the lives of Socrates and Xantippe, of Athens,"
                  said Lizzy.</p>
               <p>"Go on, Frank," said Mag, "you will be obliged to relieve yourself, so don't stop
                  for any preliminary burst of modesty. It is an age since I have visited Lyn-Glen,
                  and have a curiosity to know the state of the kingdom, since the honors of
                  philosophy and matrimony have been divided."</p>
               <p>"With due deference, and respectful consideration, I touch my hat to reply," said
                  Frank in his own grotesque style. "The sanctum has expanded since the reign of the
                  loves in Lyn-Glen. The one room of yore, which you remember, still performs the
                  part of parlor and bed-room, as well as cabinet, and an extra room has been added,
                  which combines the offices of sitting-room, dining-room and nursery."</p>
               <p>"That is a lovely rivulet behind the cottage," exclaimed Lizzy; "and how
                  beautifully that old chestnut-tree buries the house in shadows!"</p>
               <p>"And then the chestnut-burs, rolling down the big chimney, upon the parlor floor,
                  form unique scientific ornaments to a philosophic establishment," added Frank.</p>
               <p>"We are not in the slightest degree astonished yet, Frank," said Mag, "and we are
                  anxiously expecting every moment a burst of something astonishing."</p>
               <p>"How the expectations of the wicked will be cut off!" said Frank.</p>
               <p>"Do try to get the flood of description started, Frank. It will burst the barriers
                  presently. Be patient, Charlie!"</p>
               <p>"There is a marvellous garden opposite the cottage, full of culinary, botanical
                  and floral miracles," said Lizzy.</p>
               <p>"That's the way, sis—go on!"</p>
               <p>"Any items of information yet, Frank?" asked Mag.</p>
               <p>"That garden is loaded with beans, corn, roses, peas, pinks, and mourning brides,
                  potatoes, geraniums and sunflowers, cabbages, marigolds and cucumbers, oleanders,
                  melons, verbenas, fox-glove and 'pusley,' orange-trees, pig-weeds, phlox and
                  asparagus, in the most enchanting profusion."</p>
               <p>"The useful and agreeable mingled in the most convenient manner possible," added
                  Lizzy.</p>
               <p>"A perfect Eden," said Charlie.</p>
               <p>"The walls of the Eden were composed of dilapidated sticks," said Lizzy, "and the
                  gates of Paradise were able to support their gravity only by being propped up with
                  boards which, alas! were in a rickety state themselves, not able to keep out the
                  tempter."</p>
               <p>"And in the first phenomenon which we witnessed, he was tempted to try the
                  entrance in a form of a very interesting <emph>pig.</emph> Yes, the pig
                     <emph>seemed</emph> ambitious—had ideas of the better state of existence within
                  the walls of Eden. He seemed anxious to improve his own condition, which is always
                  praiseworthy in pigs and men! How much more admiration Lizzy and I had for that
                  pig, as we saw him squeezing away, at the hiatus in the fence, till he plumped
                  himself through, with a jerk that shook the foundations<pb n="190-191"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000096"/> with trembling, than if we had found him rolling in
                  mud, in the lazy luxury of untempted contentment! As Mr. Thomas Carlyle says, if
                  we have but the 'discerning eye,' rare lessons may be read in the 'open secrets'
                  of the pages of nature. Invaluable lessons may be learned of a
                  <emph>pig.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"A grizzly calf stood solemnly by, watching that pig," said Lizzy, "and, looking
                  so devoutly <emph>ugly,</emph> that I could hardly resist the monstrous
                  inclination which seized me, to <emph>strike</emph> him on account of his blessed
                  ugliness!"</p>
               <p>"Lizzy! Lizzy! Human depravity! As if the <emph>calf</emph> could be
                     <emph>blamed</emph> for its ugliness!" exclaimed Frank. "Moreover, what right
                  had you to lug in that calf before I had finished moralizing over my pig?"</p>
               <p>"Well, get your pig off the stage as soon as possible, for I have something else
                  to say."</p>
               <p>"I told you, Charlie, that they had been in regions of bliss."</p>
               <p>"Hurry on, Frank, and trot out the philosopher," said Charlie.</p>
               <p>"One thing at a time. You cannot swallow the pig, calf and philosopher together.
                  Just be patient and easy, 'good friends, <emph>sweet friends.</emph>'"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Shakspeare!</emph> as I live!" whispered Mag, emphatically.</p>
               <p>"First, the <emph>moral</emph> to the pig. Of the pig in mud we learn the blessing
                  of a contented mind. If the mud is very deep, and you can't get out"——</p>
               <p>"Who—<emph>I?</emph>" ejaculated Lizzy.</p>
               <p>"I was speaking of the <emph>pig,</emph> but if the situation suits your
                  circumstances, by all means appropriate it. As I was saying, if <emph>you</emph>
                  are in the mud all over, and <emph>can't</emph> get out, then learn from the pig
                  resignation—don't squeal—work along easily—the more you flounce and flounder and
                  make a fuss about it, the deeper in the mud you'll get; and don't presume to
                  suppose that any <emph>fellow,</emph> feeling for <emph>you,</emph> will ever help
                  you out, until you are able to help yourself out, when every fellow will manifest
                  the most interested feeling for you."</p>
               <p>"Encore! encore!" whistled Charlie.</p>
               <p>"I knew he was inspired," said Mag.</p>
               <p>"Of the pig entering that Paradise, we learn a higher moral then even this—of the
                  pursuit of high purposes under <emph>difficulties.</emph> There can be no
                  calculation of the wonderful amount that can be accomplished by <emph>persevering
                     effort,</emph> nor the unexpected help that will spur us on in great
                  emergencies cies. That pig was solving a problem seemingly beyond his capacities,
                  involved, to all human appearances, in inextricable trouble and mystery, yet had
                  not learned resignation. Although the pupil of a stoic philosopher, he had not
                  imbibed of his master the stoic philosophy. Being in a tight place, instead of
                  bearing his afflictions with the fortitude of Socrates, he squealed as if all
                  bedlam had been at his heels."</p>
               <p>"His peculiar lamentations touched Frank's human sympathies," said Lizzy, "and he
                  advanced bravely to the rescue. Inspired to valor by the music, and knowing that
                  affliction is the common lot of pigs and mortals, Frank valiantly seized a board,
                  and advanced to the storming of the breach."</p>
               <p>"He hit the pig a sudden and forcible whack from behind, which gave him tremendous
                  impetus; he shot through into the garden, dumb-founded at the unexpected
                  help—filled with amazement at his success, and quivering in a paralysis of
                  astonishment, like Sir Isaac Newton, who was paralyzed with speechless emotion at
                  his almost unhoped-for success, when he found himself solving the great secrets of
                  the laws of gravitation which keep the planets in their orbits!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Frank."</p>
               <p>"The <emph>moral</emph> of this pig: for success in any great undertaking of life,
                  we need a mighty <emph>hope</emph> before our eyes—a garden of Eden, whose
                  entrance must lure us onward. When even such a hope is not sufficient to excite
                  the lagging energies, then we must have the stern spur of <emph>necessity</emph>
                  from behind, to <emph>drive</emph> us within the walls. Only in this manner are
                  brave deeds accomplished by great souls."</p>
               <p>"A successful effort, Frank."</p>
               <p>"Now we will trot out the philosopher, Charlie, if you are ready. He trotted out
                  himself, on hearing the pig's shrieks of agony. All the powers of the place were
                  called out at one and the same time, Xantippe in the van, with a little ragged,
                  dirty urchin on either side, clinging, like the dew of Hermon, to the skirts of
                  her garments. As she advanced, she screamed to Socrates at the barn, in a key a
                  few tones higher than that of the pig, 'Socrates, why in creation don't you drive
                  that pig <emph>out</emph> of the garden?"</p>
               <p>"And Frank swallowed the implied rebuke, without a grimace," said Lizzy. "But
                  imagine his feelings, having just accomplished the feat of driving him
                     <emph>in!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Socrates strode onward in a cool, philosophic gait, to<pb n="192-193"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000097"/> invite <emph>out</emph> the pig I had let
                     <emph>into</emph> the garden. Xantippe endeavored to quicken his steps by her
                  exhortations, in vain. 'Such abominable laziness and shiftlessness,' said she, 'is
                  enough to drive a saint mad! Summer and winter, morning, noon, and night, year in
                  and year out, I've been entreating you to mend that blessed pigsty! I might as
                  well talk to the dead—a cat could accomplish more farming in a month than you will
                  get done in a century! There the garden fence hangs at loose ends, and there it
                  will hang till doomsday, if I don't mend it; <emph>you'll</emph> never bestir
                  yourself to do it! I must vibrate every day, and all day long, from the house to
                  the garden, to keep the establishment from going to rack and ruin, and then I
                  can't do it! I'm tired of it! I'm worn out! As for my racing my flesh off my
                  bones, for a life long, to keep house, garden, cows, pigs, chickens, goslins and
                  children together, I'll just tell you now I'm not going to do it any longer! I'll
                  never lift another finger!'"</p>
               <p>"You are <emph>gifted,</emph> Frank! The tone and accent are perfect!"</p>
               <p>"Gifted! A phrenologist told me once that I had a great versatility of talent,
                  besides large capacities; and as I have had the measles, whooping-cough,
                  scarlet-fever, and been in love—as I can swallow at one draught any amount of
                  abuse, without winking, besides champagne, oysters, sandwiches, ice creams, with
                  all manner of peppers and spices—as, also, I am fond of boating, love-making, and
                  swimming in high water generally, and especially fond of all kinds of
                  sharp-shooting—why, I agree with that phrenologist! But to return to the pig:
                  Lizzy, there, helped him <emph>out</emph> of the garden in a different style to my
                  helping him <emph>in;</emph> and while I was listening to the speech of Xantippe,
                  and taking notes, the philosopher thanked her for her benevolence, in behalf of
                  himself and pig."</p>
               <p>"Did you admire the philosopher, Lizzy?"</p>
               <p>"Describe him, Frank, he is beyond my powers."</p>
               <p>"The philosopher was himself an interesting individual. He wore a palm-leaf hat,
                  whose palmiest days had long since departed; it was fastened with a string of
                  twine, brown with venerable age, and the fringed edges hung with grace over his
                  black, shaggy mane; the hat turned up behind and down before, to shade his
                  countenance from the sun; his black eyes twinkled with their pristine lustre
                  beneath the brows; his slow length, with its rafters of shoulders, was enveloped
                  in what had formerly been a linen coat; the sleeves were out at the elbows, and
                  the elbows out at the sleeves; the roof of its back was rent, and the collar, in
                  despair of ever making a <emph>stand</emph> in the world, had collapsed; his vest
                  was minus; the wrecked patches of his pants flapped like banners around the
                  staff-legs, and fell in folds around his bare feet. Like his namesake of Athens,
                  he walks the world unshod."</p>
               <p>"We entered the home of philosophy," said Lizzy.</p>
               <p>"The cabinet's glory was unchanged; the 'specimens' all in their wonted places,
                  and living specimens of miniature philosophers, with black eyes like their father,
                  were hanging to their mamma. Lizzy immortalized herself on babytalk with
                  them."</p>
               <p>"The little cherubs!" said Lizzy.</p>
               <p>"And then their mother handed them over to their illustrious sire, with a
                  Xantippic, whose eloquence took my breath, while Lizzy sat unmoved. Just take care
                  of your tormenting young ones, Socrates, a little while. Amaze yourself by
                  becoming useful! You've done nothing for a week but lie in the barn, in an ecstasy
                  of contemplation. Take the brats awhile; dinner has to be invented somewhere on
                  the premises, and you have no idea where the discovery can be made.'"</p>
               <p>"And the philosopher?"</p>
               <p>"Replied very solemnly—dedicating his remarks half to her and half to us. 'We
                  ought to feed the intellect and spirit rather than the body. Let the soul expand
                  fully, and it will become unconscious of the inferior wants of the flesh. When our
                  hungerings and thirstings are entirely intellectual and spiritual, we shall forget
                  the lesser famishings of the body, in the infinite gratification of feeding soul
                  and mind. Let the flesh perish; the sooner we become all mind, the better.'"</p>
               <p>"Sublimity sublimated!"</p>
               <p>"And Xantippe answered, 'Yes, but you'll sing another song, on a different key,
                  when you get starved out. I'll let you try it yet. You'll not quote philosophy at
                  the mention of dinner then. I intend to cultivate the poetic and romantic, as we
                  did before we met the bliss of marriage. How sweetly we talked of love and
                  philosophy in a cottage in those days, as if we were to live on air! How fondly we
                  read Tasso, and dreamed of 'Jerusalem Delivered!' you'll find yours delivered to
                  confusion, and pray to be delivered from it into the New Jerusalem, when you
                     are<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6426-00000098"/> obliged to do your own washing,
                  baking and ironing, with only the help of your little brats yonder.' Malicious,
                  wasn't it, to make him sole owner of the progeny? 'Baby will help you!' she went
                  on, 'he will boil your treatises on philosophy, with his stockings, for dinner; he
                  will plunge the kitten in the flour barrel, if you have one, and stir him up with
                  a spoon; he will mix batter cakes, seasoned with pepper and sugar, in his shoes;
                  and you may have ecstasies of mysticism over it all!' Mrs. Socrates bounced out of
                  the room with a flourish like a benediction."</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Lizzy restored the equilibrium by taking Ichabod junior upon her lap, and
                  commencing a series of original remarks to him."</p>
               <p>"And then," said Lizzy, "we listened to a discussion of the <emph>woman
                     question,</emph> that <emph>you</emph> would have appreciated, Charlie. The
                  female mind, he said, was not adapted to the pursuit of philosophic truth. Mrs.
                  Wilson had no idea of stoicism—he supposed all women were restless, fretful and
                  fidgety—all born with strange ideas about love and felicity—real life never
                  fulfilled a woman's dreams. Women for that reason ought to inure themselves to
                  expect disappointments, and bear them with composure—it was the discipline of
                  life. Women ought not to fret and fume if things went wrong; nor try to comb the
                  hair of their unfortunate victims with pokers, in wrath and vengeance."</p>
               <p>"Amen! A philosophic truth!" said Frank, enthusiastically.</p>
               <p>"Care, he said, should pass through the mind as lightly as the winds through the
                  leaves. To a free spirit, content with the contemplation of the divine, what was
                  hunger, or cold, or pain?"</p>
               <p>"Query! What?" asked Frank.</p>
               <p>"If the mind received thorough discipline it would be so elevated it would not be
                  conscious of want or sorrow."</p>
               <p>"Let us strive to reach that elevation!" said Frank.</p>
               <p>"He brought the question <emph>home</emph> to us, by entreating us to remember his
                  words when we were married. Never, never until then could we realize the strength
                  of their truth—then we should find disappointment—but console ourselves—our
                  afflictions would be mutual—as broad as they were long; both parties would surely
                  find mutual disappointment in each other. The stoic philosophy alone would be
                  powerful then."</p>
               <p>"We were anxious to warn you and Mag, Charlie, before you came to the irrevocable,
                  so we hurried away to rehearse the lesson while it was fresh."</p>
               <p>"Thank you," said Charlie, with sublime composure. And they started for home.</p>
               <p>"When Mag and I distinguish ourselves, as no doubt we shall," said Frank, "it will
                  be owing to the invaluable lessons ground in our youthful minds by Socrates."</p>
               <p>"With his attainments he ought to be president of a university."</p>
               <p>"So his friends say," Frank replied, "and thought that if he only had a little
                  more <emph>electricity,</emph> it would redeem him; and that was tried upon him
                  last summer; he was struck by lightning one day without deriving any perceptible
                  benefit, and his friends have given it up, that even electricity could not save
                  him."</p>
               <p>As the party came down the mountains, and crossed the bridge, they saw before them
                  blind Grandfather Barclay, pioneered by two little beauties of four years
                  old—Jenny Hale and Etta Fanshaw. Jenny was chattering to him like a magpie; Etta
                  watching carefully for all the sticks and stones over which he might stumble. The
                  village children were the especial guardians of Grandfather Barclay.</p>
               <p>Suddenly the three stopped under the large oak on the village Green. Etta was
                  sobbing woefully, and Jenny flying around her in great excitement, striking Etta
                  upon her shoulders with all her baby energy.</p>
               <p>"There is the evil of original sin!" said Charlie. "Is there any remedy for it in
                  this case?"</p>
               <p>But Mag and Lizzy had both flown to the rescue.</p>
               <p>"What is it, Etta? What is the matter, Jenny?" asked Mag.</p>
               <p>Etta looked up in their faces with her large, black, pleading eyes brimming with
                  tears; the bright red lips could hardly choke down her sobs to lisp the
                  unspeakable grief—poor, suffering baby.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Miss Mag, there's a bee got down my back, and its going to <emph>kill</emph>
                  me. I know it is!"</p>
               <p>The imploring look was irresistible.</p>
               <p>"It is stinging me to death, Miss Mag!"</p>
               <p>Lizzy stripped the dress from the dimpled shoulders; Mag crushed the bee in her
                  fingers, while Jenny looked on in brave eagerness at the operation.</p>
               <p>"I guess he won't sting you any more, Etta," she said.<pb n="196-197"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000099"/> "I <emph>pounded</emph> him good!" Jenny looked
                  vastly satisfied with her efforts.</p>
               <p>Lizzy and Mag went into a metaphysical discussion of Etta's pain, as they led her
                  home—not quite deciding whether it was located at the end of the nerve where the
                  bee performed his scientific work, or whether it was in the end of the nerve at
                  the brain; they wrapped themselves into the mystery of a man's having pain in his
                  arm, when he had no arm; and Mag, of course, wondered <emph>how,</emph> by Eve's
                  sin, pain came upon bees and reptiles, and wondered if Eve ever got stung
                     <emph>before</emph> she saw the serpent in Eden, and sinned.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile Frank and Charlie piloted grandfather home.</p>
               <p>As they entered the yard they discovered Grandma Barclay, clothed in her usual
                  authority, laying down the law to little Harry Fenn, who, like grandma, had
                  imbibed the notion that he was <emph>born to rule.</emph> All the domestic
                  feathered creation—chickens, goslings and turkeys—belonged to grandma's dominions;
                  Harry had invaded her preëmption rights. The little autocrat was making powerful
                  efforts to annihilate all the goslings. He lifted one lordly litle bare foot to
                  place it with the most energetic momentum, and with the most careful precision,
                  exactly upon the centre of their backs; his mouth and teeth being screwed together
                  like a vice in the intense interest of the occupation; as one poor wretch
                  fluttered away with a shriek of mortal fear, he lifted the other foot to crush the
                  next screaming biped. The despot, like another Nero, was enjoying the misery of
                  his subjects, but grandma came upon him like Nemesis, and when the party came up
                  was giving Master Harry a tremendous spanking, while he fought her with might and
                  main, resisting her authority to the last.</p>
               <p>"If you ever dare touch one of my goslings again, you little scamp," said she,
                  "I'll spank you within an inch of your life!" She picked up two little crippled
                  fellows, while Harry ran home bawling at the top of his lungs. Grandma was
                  righteously indignant.</p>
               <p>"If that rascal aint born to be hung, I wouldn't say it! If Alph Fenn can't bring
                  up his boys better than he's bringing up that one, he had better not have any
                  boys."</p>
               <p>"Original sin again," thought Mag. "How came Harry by his depravity?"</p>
               <p>Grandma nursed her crippled goslings in a basket of cotton ton; Charlie and Mag
                  discussed original sin, and Lizzy and Frank entertained grandfather and the
                  children.</p>
               <p>Alec Ross came in at last and challenged Lizzy to a game of chess, and they seated
                  themselves in a recess of the bay window.</p>
               <p>"I am right superstitious about chess, Cousin Alec," said Lizzy. "I have a sort of
                  presentiment that my destiny is in someway connected with it. I am anxious to play
                  a skillful game. Do you believe in presentiments?"</p>
               <p>"Do you study it for a game of destiny?" asked Alec. "Well, it <emph>is</emph>
                  like the game of destiny—there is but very little <emph>chance</emph> about it;
                  the losers are those who do not study the moves closely."</p>
               <p>"And in destiny, as in chess, we cannot play <emph>alone;</emph> our moves must
                  depend upon the moves of our partners," said Lizzy.</p>
               <p>Mag stood in the door, twirling her bonnet on her finger by one string, as she
                  meditated the propriety of starting for home.</p>
               <p>"We are the arbiters of our own destiny," said Charlie to her. "In the game we
                  play we shall both win; there shall be no such thing as losing."</p>
               <p>To which speech Mag responded only by a graceful courtesy; but Frank, who was
                  listening to the gallantry, made reply with characteristic expression:</p>
               <p>"Q. E. D.—which must be demonstrated. I know Mag of old. You have on hand a crazy
                  game to play with her. I give you fair warning in fair season; advise you to
                  insure yourself against damages; she looks secure, soft, careless, amiable—the
                  tiger-pussy. You have never yet seen the claws under the soft touch of her paw.
                  She is a splendid creature though, if ever you do tame her. I hope you'll do your
                  best for the sake of the world."</p>
               <p>Mag made another demure courtesy.</p>
               <p>"Be assured I will do my <emph>best,</emph> Frank," said Charlie, gathering a
                  half-opened rose-bud, and placing it in her hair, as she lingered on the step. He
                  looked down upon her earnestly.</p>
               <p>"Will you let me come and give you a lesson to-morrow?"</p>
               <p>She turned at the gate.</p>
               <p>"I must help Aunt Lina to-morrow; so <emph>you</emph> could not be useful."</p>
               <p>"It must be endured," said Charlie, disappointed. "Shake<pb n="198-199"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000100"/> hands to comfort me!" Charlie held one hand on the
                  gate to stay her departure, and offered the other hand. "Good bye, little
                  siren."</p>
               <p>She answered only by a merry laugh—turned through the back gate, and bounded
                  homeward alone, through the garden.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>XVII. HUNTING.</head>
               <p>CHARLIE and Frank, with horses, dogs and guns, were off before sunrise the next
                  morning among the southern hills of the Green Mountains—their spirits rioting with
                  rugged nature. Charlie had been rehearsing a part of his conversation with
                  Mag—concluding with the sublime observation:</p>
               <p>"Out of chaos every man must grind his own faith."</p>
               <p>"It is a luxury," Frank blurted out, "to pour out all manner of abominations that
                  are running rampant in one's brain, without being in danger of stultifying into
                  more intense stupidity, some fool who has not the slightest glimmer of one's
                  meaning, and therefore consigns one to the bottomless pit with holy horror, yet
                  praying with great unction and fervor that one's sins, by contact, may not stain
                  his own spotless garments."</p>
               <p>And they rode on in silence—or whistling to their dogs. Charlie at last broke
                  forth again:</p>
               <p>"Given, in the mill of thought, all the religions and philosophies of all ages,
                  all the experience of all men of all nations, to find something to
                     <emph>rely</emph> upon, as man is tossed from birth to death, upon the little
                  billow of life—something to assure man that the wave will not at last"——</p>
               <p>"Pitch him into the fire!" suggested Frank.</p>
               <p>"Yes—the question of ages—regenerated in every new, thinking soul. If there is a
                  God, what is He doing with us here? If religion is not merely a mask for
                  concealing and carrying on all manner of corrupt devices—as it manifests itself
                  beyond the sanctuary of hills like these, and, no doubt, even here; then—what?
                  why? wherefore?"</p>
               <p>"Even in travelling the <emph>broad</emph> road to destruction that I am
                  travelling," said Frank, "the company of these pious hypocrites is so deathly
                  irksome and tedious to me, that I am tempted to leave the <emph>broad</emph> road,
                  and cut out a <emph>private</emph> path to the abyss, toward which we are
                     <emph>all</emph> going—a private road set round with hedges and thorns, where
                  one's folly may play the wild, and never a stupid fool harmed thereby—as they
                  would not be, if they could be taught to mind their own business, and forbear
                  treading on the toes of other fools, their companions."</p>
               <p>"The very conception of religion—of <emph>adoration</emph>—the consciousness in
                  our souls, that we <emph>must</emph> approve, honor, aye, <emph>worship</emph>
                  what seems noble, proves the probability of the existence of
                     <emph>perfection</emph> somewhere in the universe, to satisfy those longings
                  and tendencies of our natures—or nature has contradicted herself and created a
                  vacuum in the human soul. We do <emph>know</emph> that we thirst for holiness,
                  purity and perfection in our better moments, as strangers in desolation thirst for
                  love in their sickening weariness. The analogy of nature teaches the probability
                  that there exists some created or Uncreated Perfection to satisfy those yearnings.
                  As Descartes has it: 'The conception of a God, proves the existence of a
                  God.'"</p>
               <p>"Man cannot <emph>prove</emph> annihilation. Not an atom of <emph>matter</emph>
                  has ever been annihilated—the analogy is then that <emph>spirit</emph> cannot be
                  destroyed. The strong <emph>probability</emph> stands that man has an
                     <emph>immortal</emph> soul—an article which it is absolutely impossible to
                  dispose of. The myth of those gods tiring of their immortality, and begging of
                  Zeus the boon of <emph>death,</emph> shows one curious phase of human
                  thought."</p>
               <p>"If Mirabeau was mistaken at last, and found death an <emph>awakening</emph>
                  instead of an eternal <emph>sleep!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"And if my father is mistaken in supposing the hereafter means heaven alone! There
                  are many <emph>chances</emph> at least against the supposition. Natural religion
                  teaches of a hell. We cannot fathom our own being, without knowing the power of
                  evil. One thing I fully believe, 'The heart is deceitful above all things, and
                  desperately wicked.' The analogy of nature teaches of hell as much as heaven."</p>
               <p>"The <emph>strong</emph> argument for universal salvation, from those who pretend
                  to accept the Bible, is drawn from Christ's teachings. His command to
                     <emph>man</emph> is, '<emph>Forgive your enemies!</emph>
                  <pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6426-00000101"/>
                  <emph>Love your enemies! Do good to those that hate you!</emph> OVERCOME EVIL WITH
                  GOOD.' If men are made God-like by doing this—and no one will deny that it
                  ennobles man—that it is the spirit's most perfect discipline—then the God, like
                  whom they become, <emph>forgives unconditionally</emph> also—which is a paradox,
                  since Christ has died. If Christ died to save men from <emph>sin on earth,</emph>
                  his death was an entire failure. If God forgives unconditionally, as Christ
                  teaches men to do, then the crucifixion and bloody sweat, and the 'My God why hast
                  thou forsaken me!' was a wretched, miserable, worse than useless mockery to both
                  man and the Man-God. If those men who <emph>suppose</emph> there is no hell are
                  mistaken! It is at best merely a <emph>supposition.</emph> If there is a deep
                  meaning to those other words of Christ—'<emph>Unless ye repent, ye shall all
                     likewise</emph> PERISH!'—then what?" Charlie rode on in silence, and then
                  added, "This immortal soul is a stupendous gift—if indeed we are endowed with it.
                  We cannot lay it aside at our <emph>will.</emph> It <emph>may</emph> become a
                  terrible curse from which we can never free ourselves. The human heart in its
                  mortal life knows sublime depths, both of suffering and bliss"——</p>
               <p>Frank interrupted Charlie, with a grotesque turn to the thought, in his own
                  style.</p>
               <p>"Curious affairs these hearts are, anyway; they have such unmanageable tricks of
                     <emph>aching.</emph> I keep mine in tolerable order, but it plays the deuce
                  with me at times, spite of my training. It gets beyond my control, especially when
                  a certain <emph>little feminine shadow</emph> approaches within magnetic distance.
                  By the by, Charlie, you will have Old Nick's own game to play with Mag, I'll give
                  you warning again, right now."</p>
               <p>"Then I shall teach her heart that trick of <emph>aching.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"No doubt of that, though she has a wayward fancy for torturing it herself. A
                  long, crooked road she is going to lead you, before you win her, pliant as she
                  seems."</p>
               <p>"Then I shall teach that heart wild lessons."</p>
               <p>"I don't doubt it. She has, I say, a queer crotchet of teaching it ugly lessons
                  herself. You are now holding the establishment in a sort of death-gripe, from
                  which she is struggling with might and main to <emph>free</emph> herself. She will
                  do it, too, if you are not wiser than the serpent."</p>
               <p>"She will <emph>not free</emph> herself. Her heart is here, fastened in chains to
                  mine."</p>
               <p>"She will break the chains, and punish it for its present submission—thinking,
                  too, sweet little soul, that she is acting for <emph>your benefit entirely.</emph>
                  She has the odd idea that her heart is covered with thorns, and must be an
                  uncomfortable piece of furniture in your breast, and it will be her
                     <emph>duty</emph> to keep it out of your way. She will discipline the thing.
                  She believes love is only a discipline and development, anyway. She will freeze
                  her heart to ice for you."</p>
               <p>"And mine is hot enough to melt an iceberg."</p>
               <p>"She will change it to adamant, then."</p>
               <p>"By all that is holy, I will <emph>break</emph> it! But even then she will find it
                  back in the central depths, some day—a fragment of flesh, again, full of
                  torture."</p>
               <p>"And she will herself trample it into its element of dust, and bid it lie there
                  and <emph>ache on.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Then, I will come and lift it from the dust—will breathe new life into it. I will
                  teach her that it is not a <emph>single</emph> affair, but a <emph>double</emph>
                  organ, beating and throbbing—thrilling the whole system with life—the blood in the
                  pulses fresh and free, too."</p>
               <p>"And bounding on at a two forty pace, and when the heart becomes a tyrant, you
                  will set it to bleeding inwardly, to reduce the tone—drip, drip, drip, tears of
                  brine and blood."</p>
               <p>"If the heart of flesh in its mortality has such fearful depths of mortification
                  and torture, what must be the capacities of the <emph>immortal soul,</emph> which,
                  in its infinite depths of torture can <emph>never</emph> lay down its immortality!
                  We are inconsistent wretches, Frank."</p>
               <p>"Yes; Mag is no more wayward and inconsistent in the management of her heart, than
                  we in the management of our souls. Political economy would teach us to prepare for
                  the worst <emph>supposable</emph> case, and not risk the chances."</p>
               <p>"As Byron has it, Frank, 'Indisputably, the firm believers in the Gospel have a
                  great advantage over all others, for this simple reason, that if true, they will
                  have their reward hereafter; and if there be no hereafter, they can be but with
                  the infidel in his eternal sleep, having had the assistance of an exalted hope
                  through life, without subsequent disappointment, since (at the worst for them),
                  "out of nothing, nothing can arise," not even sorrow.'"</p>
               <p>"But Byron never said a truer thing, Charlie, than when he said 'a man's creed did
                  not depend upon himself. Who can say I <emph>will</emph> believe this—and least of
                  all this which he least can comprehend?'"</p>
               <pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6426-00000102"/>
               <p>The two rode on in silence till they reached the top of the hill; there they
                  paused to listen to what Nature taught. The sun was purpling the mists upon the
                  hills, and pouring its morning glory down into the long sweep of valleys where the
                  villages lay smiling, and graceful cloud-drapery, unfolding in rainbow tints,
                  spread away over the winding waters of the Connecticut. They turned again into the
                  forests.</p>
               <p>"Suffering is a sublime teacher," said Charlie, at last. "Can you tell me what it
                  has taught Magdalene Barclay?"</p>
               <p>"Many things that she will unlearn before the end comes. Now she looks upon life
                  from a wrong stand-point, and sees it through false media. She has never known the
                  meaning of the word <emph>home,</emph> or <emph>home-love.</emph> I stand to her,
                  I verily believe, in the place of both. She has found her social life in books,
                  and her companionship with her own heart."</p>
               <p>"You have molded and educated her, Frank."</p>
               <p>"God forbid, for I have offered her poison; there was the antidote within herself,
                  if it has not harmed her. Whether there is innate principle to reject poison,
                  whether the mind has native principle enough to control circumstances, or whether
                  principle is merely the result of circumstances, is a problem. Thus far, if Mag
                  has imbibed poison, its effects have not appeared. She is becoming liberal in
                  opinion—a <emph>free</emph>-thinker. She would have become that without me, and
                  thought become more morbid than now."</p>
               <p>"How so?"</p>
               <p>"At Uncle Alph's she lives two lives—a double life—one in which she forgets
                  entirely her true, better self, and studies human weaknesses. In self-defence, she
                  learned to humor human frailties, to make among discords a retreat or shelter from
                  injury; now she is tempted to make them her pastime; she is tempted to try to
                     <emph>rise</emph> by them; she studies them to gain power, as when a young
                  cadet presents himself who gratifies her tastes. Sometimes she throws off the
                  outer self—she gives up her whole self to the study, in momentary, passionate
                  forgetfulness. She intensifies life and <emph>love,</emph> for like Goethe, she
                  would learn all that <emph>love</emph> can teach. With the whole strength of a
                  pure, passionate nature, she buries herself in the passing life, to learn all that
                  life may teach."</p>
               <p>"It teaches what a woman ought never to know!"</p>
               <p>"She will never pass the bounds! In solitude, she forces away every thought that
                  can harass her, considering ing happiness as a duty, to be cultivated with health.
                  In her daily life she hears bitter upbraiding; to forget and drown this, she
                  intoxicates herself with books, as men intoxicate themselves with wine or opium,
                  to forget a curse in their home-life. She is obliged to read <emph>strong</emph>
                  books at times, to forget passionate thought, which, if indulged, would drive her
                  mad."</p>
               <p>"We are young, Frank. Men of experience have told me, that if they <emph>gave
                     themselves up</emph> to the power of memories in their accursed former life,
                  the memories would be Erinnys, scourging them to insanity. And, forgetfulness was
                  to them an art, studied for self-preservation. But go on, Frank—define Miss Mag's
                  position."</p>
               <p>"She has little reverence for anything human; God knows she has had little enough
                  occasion. A noble human love would redeem that defect; she could learn adoration,
                  and it would call out a new nature in her, and redeem her. Get her to worship you,
                  Charlie; force her to <emph>trust</emph> in you, be true to her yourself, and you
                  will be her salvation. Just now she is so insanely <emph>proud</emph> of her
                     <emph>humility,</emph> that if she adores you, nothing short of a miracle will
                  induce her to accept you. But we must leave our horses if we go up that
                  ledge."</p>
               <p>"That is the flight the bird takes," thought Charlie, as they dismounted after
                  this unique disquisition. All day long, as they were bagging their game, his head
                  was busy laying a cunning snare for caging a bird of paradise.</p>
               <p>It was late in the afternoon when they returned. Within a mile of the village,
                  they discovered Lizzy and Mag seated upon a jutting crag that overhung the
                  road-side. They reined up their horses in front of the maidens, halted, and
                  saluted them, bowing to the manes of their horses.</p>
               <p>"Whence and whither thy wanderings, silver footed Thetis?" was Charlie's address
                  to Mag. And the lady replied:</p>
               <p>"From a visit to Socrates the sage, homeward."</p>
               <p>"We have become disciples of philosophy," said Lizzy. "Can you not afford us
                  another lecture to-day, Cousin Frank? I know you did not exhaust yourself
                  yesterday."</p>
               <p>"Don't mention the subject to him, Lizzy," remonstrated Mag. "If you give him half
                  an opportunity, he will bewilder our wits and his own for the next hour."</p>
               <p>"Don't throw down the glove in that fashion, Mag," said Frank.</p>
               <pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6426-00000103"/>
               <p>"Charming idea! I should like a speech from Frank above all things. Mr. Ross is
                  called upon for a speech."</p>
               <p>"Ross, you are called for," added Charlie.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Ross! Mr. Ross! Mr. Ross!" and the ladies clapped their pretty hands.</p>
               <p>Frank doffed his cap, without changing a muscle of his imperturbable face, bowed
                  as gracefully as circumstances would permit, swept his fingers through the short
                  clustering curls, and commenced:</p>
               <p>"Ladies and gentle<emph>man</emph>—Overpowered with the sense of the distinguished
                  honor so suddenly conferred upon me, you will make all due allowance for my modest
                  blushes, while I request you to name the subject on which you would be
                  enlightened."</p>
               <p>"The ladies," said Charlie.</p>
               <p>"Socrates of Athens," answered Lizzy.</p>
               <p>With another bow, in which his horse joined, he commenced with slow emphasis. Like
                  a river whose barriers were not removed.</p>
               <p>"In this great nineteenth century, it has become somewhat the fashion, for ladies
                  of the ambitious stamp to consider themselves an unappreciated class. Their rights
                  and wrongs have been harped upon, rung in so many changes, that even in a change
                  of key, the melody has become woefully monotonous; the thread of the song (or
                  argument) has been so harshly fingered, that the interwoven theme is quite
                  threadbare; yet here, before this enlightened and <emph>highly</emph> interesting
                  audience (applause), we have the daring to venture another variation of the
                  tiresome theme played by unskilled fingers on a harp ('of a thousand strings,' put
                  in Charlie, sotto voce,) whose chords are time worn and out of tune! (Immense
                  applause—cries of hear, hear.)</p>
               <p>"Out of unfathomable depths of sorrow—aye, and of sin—at times of torture that has
                  changed the glorious nature of woman, as she was created by God, into a nature
                  like that of man or fiend, the world's repeated cry has been wrung—What is
                  truth?</p>
               <p>"Women have questioned God and their own souls. And when to them as to Pilate
                  there came but 'silence as a benediction,' they too have gone mad and babbled of
                  woman's rights and woman's wrongs, till there have arisen many Babels, followed by
                  confusion of tongues, and confusion worse confounded, amid which babblings are
                  mingled many truths with most monstrous error. (Cries of hear, hear.)</p>
               <p>"We give, then, as a proposition: There is much of unappreciated merit in the
                  lives of mortals. Of this unappreciated class, Xantippe of Athens has a most
                  powerful claim upon our sympathies. She herself, no doubt, would demand it as her
                     <emph>right</emph> if, like her sisters of the present age, her celebrated
                  tongue could now break its once unaccustomed silence, and speak with its ancient
                  energy concerning the wrongs of woman. (Applause—cries of bravo! bravo!)</p>
               <p>"There is much unappreciated merit in humanity. Socrates himself taught that if a
                  divinity were to dwell among men as man, he would meet only scorn, contempt,
                  persecution, and, perchance, crucifixion.</p>
               <p>"With our human eyes, eagerly searching for the divine in the human, we cannot
                  recognize it when manifested before us; we too, like those of old, entertain
                  angels <emph>unawares.</emph> It needs a hero's eye to <emph>know</emph> a hero;
                  it may need an angel's heart to know an angel. We claim if there was anything
                  heroic, or divine, or gracefully woman-like and human in the character of Xantippe
                  of Athens, it had no opportunity for growth or culture, or even of appreciation in
                  her life with Socrates the Philosopher. (Silent applause.)</p>
               <p>"Woman's name has often been immortalized by its connection with its poet or
                  hero-lover. Dante gave immortality to Beatrice; Petrarch to Laura; Tasso to
                  Leonora; Burns to his Highland Mary; Socrates to Xantippe—but he endowed her with
                  an immortality of <emph>infamy.</emph> Her name has come down to us through the
                  ages a byword, a scoff, a reproach to the very name of woman.</p>
               <p>"Xantippe, no doubt, had her virtues; had she been but the wife of a common man,
                  endowed with some wealth, some common business talent, and but little philosophy;
                  a man who, unlike Socrates, would have gratified her simple, feminine tastes, her
                  innocent womanly vanities, she would probably have lived happy, amiable and
                  beloved, and gone at last to an honored grave; her virtues
                     <emph>appreciated,</emph> her faults unnoticed, or consigned with her virtues
                  to a peaceful and blessed oblivion.</p>
               <p>"There is a marvellous sympathy in the human breast for a lofty soul when
                  persecuted for righteousness' sake, and for this, Socrates, the philosopher,
                  became Socrates, the heromartyr. 'To be <emph>weak</emph> is miserable,' says
                  Milton, the great poet of England; and Carlyle, of England, yields his gracious
                  assent to the proposition, and reiterates: 'It is a <emph>terrible</emph> thing to
                  be weaker than our task.' Xantippe, then, demands<pb n="206-207"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000104"/> of us that '<emph>terrible</emph>' pity, for she in
                  all her life-work found herself, not only like Dickens of our day, subjected to
                  the horrors of 'incompatibility of sentiment,' but <emph>weaker than her
                     task.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"Philosophy is a glorious thing. Plato tells us of the divine wisdom of Socrates.
                  Splendid theories he had concerning God, or <emph>the gods</emph>—wonderful
                  hypotheses of man, his origin and destiny. He was rich in the lore of human
                  weaknesses; for, measuring his own heart, he held the gauge for all human frailty.
                  With his celebrated dictum of 'know thyself,' he laid his foundation for human
                  knowledge, but concerning the <emph>woman question,</emph> Socrates was most
                  unblissfully ignorant. He made it the amusement and study of his life, to search
                  for and draw out human vanity from its lurking-places in human hearts; his
                  life-aim was to expose the frail reasoning of other men to the mockery of the
                  public. Utterly ignorant he professed to be of truth, but with an overwhelming
                  desire to know her. He sounded the knowledge of other men by his subtle skill with
                  weapons of logic—convinced them how shallow and unreliable were all their
                     <emph>opinions,</emph> and exposed their vain weakness of understanding with
                  his pitiless syllogisms; and for this it was that vain men <emph>hated</emph> him;
                  for this he paid his price also—a death of ignominy, which, for truth's sake, was
                  changed to glory.</p>
               <p>"The <emph>philo</emph>-sophia in human nature is a great <emph>love.</emph>
                  Goethe made <emph>self</emph>-culture his deity—so did Socrates; he disciplined
                  himself to wary and cunning habits of thought, but the German was the more
                  successful philosopher. Goethe studied poetic grace, refinement, polish; he became
                  familiar with the secrets of human hearts, by dissecting them while breathing
                  passion; he put them to slow torture, that he might discover by the various phases
                  of agony and joy how fearfully and wonderfully they were made. Goethe was another
                  Solomon—unfortunately for him and the ladies, under a different regime of morals.
                  Socrates was a lover of manly intellect, not of womanly or manly grace. He trailed
                  sophistical opinions over the hunting-ground of intellect to their secret
                  labyrinths, with wonderful skill. As Ariadne guided the blind footsteps of Theseus
                  through the Labyrinth by her subtle thread, so then he guided forth the blind
                  vanity of human knowledge, concealed in the labyrinths of human intellects, by his
                  subtle thread of argument! As Theseus abandoned Ariadne—that beautiful specimen of
                  frailty, whose name is <emph>woman</emph> (<emph>groans,</emph> cries of
                  Shakspeare)—to the cruel mercies of the winds, waves and desolate rocks of Naxos,
                  so Socrates, having exposed the frailties of human reason in other men, abandoned
                  them to mockery and scorn, on that heart of rock—the world; and so, also, having
                  betrayed forth her weakness to the knowledge of the world by his cruel mercy, he
                  abandoned that frailty, whose woman's name was Xantippe. (Applause and
                     <emph>groans</emph>).</p>
               <p>"It was the fault, it was also the misfortune, of Socrates, the heathen
                  philosopher, that he was ignorant of the woman question; it was not only his fault
                  and misfortune, but also those of the <emph>times.</emph> Never, after the fall in
                  Eden, until Christianity was born on earth, did woman take her place at man's side
                  as his <emph>equal.</emph> Profoundly skilled as were the philosophers of Greece
                  and Rome in knowledge of men and art, they were as profoundly ignorant on the
                  questions of <emph>woman's rights.</emph> Plato, in his 'Republic,' places woman
                  as man's inferior, but superior to a brute, because she may become the mother of
                  heroes; and in the very glory time of Greece and Rome, she was treated
                  accordingly. Aspasia's self was but the exception to this rule—the exception which
                  but <emph>proves</emph> the rule. Aspasia's self, the friend of Socrates, the
                  honored wife of Pericles, who beguiled the very hearts of men by the fascinating
                  grace of her intellect—Aspasia, charming by her very frailty, for weakness,
                  frailty and dependence is woman's most powerful charm—Aspasia's self was but
                     <emph>one</emph> exception to this sad truth.</p>
               <p>"Alcibiades, the princely lover of Socrates, took Hypparete, of the noblest blood
                  of Athens, from the Archon, carried her in his arms by force, when, as an outraged
                  wife, she appealed to the judges against him, claiming a divorce for the honor of
                  her womanhood. No doubt, he conquered her and won her love again by the charm of
                  his magnificent manliness; for woman does worship power in man supremely. Man now
                  may conquer woman as his slave, when he tempers his proud strength with delicate,
                  loving flattery. (Hisses—groans).</p>
               <p>"Socrates, unlike Alcibiades, was not of the princely order; never did he
                  fascinate Xantippe by glorious, <emph>manly</emph> perfections. Not for any
                  physical grace did her heart go out to meet him in love. Not for mental endowments
                  could she adore him—she had not the hero soul to recognize the hero; and not for
                  any winning household ways; not for<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6426-00000105"/> his
                  domestic virtues—his mind was beyond these paltry things. What were they to
                  Socrates the philosopher of Athens?"</p>
               <p>"Or of Glenlyn?" interrupted Lizzy. "Describe the Athenian, Frank."</p>
               <p>"We can picture the man as historians describe him. To a shrivelled diminutive
                  figure, with bare feet and shabby garments, add the charm of a satyr-like face,
                  with rolling, protruding eyes, a broad, flat, upturned nose, with expanded
                  nostrils. His days were spent in strolling barefoot around the streets of Athens;
                  his mind superior to any thought of dress or physical deformity; his prime
                  business to provoke to controversy all men, on all subjects in heaven and earth
                  then dreampt of in philosophy; and when the sultry noontide had hushed the tide of
                  discussion, he left the feast of reason, to luxuriate in solemn contemplation
                  beneath the trees in the suburbs of Athens."</p>
               <p>"Please describe Xantippe, Frank," said Lizzy.</p>
               <p>"Imagination alone can picture her. Her frailty was feminine frailty; her heart,
                  no doubt, was filled with all feminine longings for the beautiful. Her lord sought
                  fellowship with intellectual and divine beauty, leaving his household to the
                  supervision of those unwelcome inmates—poverty and care."</p>
               <p>Mag was growing restless and naughty under the inspiration of Frank's eloquence.
                  He went on with the discourse:</p>
               <p>"Xantippe had, no doubt, a woman's cravings for the beautiful"——</p>
               <p>"Silks, laces and jewels!" said Mag, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">sotto voce.</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>"The true and the <emph>good,</emph>" Frank continued.</p>
               <p>"Sweetmeats, bonbons, oysters, sandwiches," continued Mag.</p>
               <p>"Ladies and gentleman, my discourse being beyond your comprehension, I see it
                  tires your mental energies."</p>
               <p>"Go on, Frank—we are miracles of patience."</p>
               <p>"Athens, in the day of Xantippe was the queen-city of elegance, luxury and
                  refinement—the empire home of the arts, sciences and muses (applause, groans,
                  hear, hear). But Socrates, the friend of Pericles and Aspasia, never gratified his
                  wife Xantippe in her deep thirst for the beautiful. In self-defence and
                  desperation, she turned against her lord—the <emph>wandering</emph> half of her
                  own soul. Upon him she poured entreaties, reproaches, benedictions and
                  maledictions tions, in vain! Alas! for womanly weakness when battling against
                  manly intellectual strength! It only deepened the curse already upon her, and
                  hastened her ruin and infamy! Had Socrates known the Man-God, he would not only
                  have recognized the divinity in man, but he would have discovered the divinity in
                  woman also. Had Xantippe sat at the feet of Christ, and learned of him to be meek
                  and lowly in heart, she might have found her good, beautiful and true in the
                  Christian command—'Let the wife see that she reverence her husband.'</p>
               <p>"Ladies and gentleman, I thus take the liberty of closing my remarks."</p>
               <p>The discourse closed with applause that startled the horses.</p>
               <p>"Do you call your speech an inspiration, or an improvisation, Frank?" asked
                  Mag.</p>
               <p>"My genius is all the result of labor long continued, and of the severest kind. I
                  commenced that speech in my earliest youth, and it is the result of years of
                  investigation and intense thought."</p>
               <p>"Cousin Frank, you are a <emph>model</emph> youth," said Lizzy.</p>
               <p>"A model of absurdity!" said Mag.</p>
               <p>"Thank you, ladies. I return to each the compliment you have given. We find it
                  absolutely impossible to rend ourselves from such fascinating society, and it is
                  time we were going home; Lizzy, you may ride behind me, home to supper. I am
                  famously hungry, and so is Charlie. We have eaten to-day nothing to speak of, but
                  live birds, whose feathers were beautiful to look upon but hard of digestion—not
                  mentioning the squirrels, whose fur was uncomfortable for the season. With birds
                  and squirrels together, there's a commotion in my appetite. So, Lizzy, please
                  hurry!"</p>
               <p>"I used to ride behind Charlie to the 'Old Field School' on the plantation, before
                  we went to Huntsville."</p>
               <p>"Old Field School?" said Mag; "I always thought there was something extraordinary
                  in Charlie's education."</p>
               <p>"Charlie practised elocution there; we all studied aloud at the top of our lungs,
                  so that we might be able to <emph>hear ourselves think.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"There you learned your wonderful concentration of thought, Mr. Moore?"</p>
               <p>"The last time Charlie was at home he was buried in theology, till we all
                  concluded that the son of the family was about to take orders. The decision was,
                  that he was<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6426-00000106"/> aiming at the chaplaincy of
                  the army. His education has been really <emph>various,</emph>" said Lizzy.</p>
               <p>"Do you know your horse will carry double, Frank?" asked Lizzy.</p>
               <p>"We can tell by trying. He will find it difficult to disturb the equilibrium of
                  two such weighty people, when once settled on a course of action."</p>
               <p>The horse reared and plunged, as Lizzy sprang up behind Frank, but finding himself
                  unable to unseat his riders, gave up the attempt in docile despair.</p>
               <p>"You will frighten the natives, sis, if you go through the village in that
                  fashion," Charlie commented.</p>
               <p>"Confound the natives!" was Frank's reverential response. "We are the leaders of
                  fashion in Glenlyn."</p>
               <p>"Look out for your gun, Frank!" called Charlie, as Lizzy's dress became entangled
                  in the trigger—the gun resting on the toe of Frank's boot.</p>
               <p>"All right! Now, Miss Mag, will you ride?" he asked, as they rode off. "I must see
                  you home, you know."</p>
               <p>"I must excuse myself, Charlie."</p>
               <p>And this was precisely what Charlie wanted; not that he objected to Mag's riding
                  behind him, but he preferred some other entertainment just then. He had a wicked
                  experiment in his head, and he was in haste to try it. He rode after Frank, and
                  said emphatically:</p>
               <p>"Look out, Frank, for my horse, when it comes plunging down the road, catch it,
                  and let sis ride it home; the saddle will not trouble her, she is accustomed to
                  ride any kind of saddle. Don't be alarmed when you hear my gun; I have no idea of
                  letting a lady's dress be caught upon it; I shall not carry mine loaded, you
                  understand."</p>
               <p>"I understand," said Frank, as he rode around the brow of the hill, out of sight.
                  Frank was slightly mistaken in his cunning understanding, for once in his
                  life.</p>
               <p>Charlie waited a moment, till they were out of his way, then galloped out of Mag's
                  sight after Frank. A few instants passed, and Mag heard the report of his gun,
                  then she saw his horse, riderless, dashing up the road.</p>
               <p>A wild terror seized her; she sprang from the rock, bounded down the ledge, down
                  the road, and saw Charlie Moore lying motionless on the ground; his gun and cadet
                  cap by his side; his black curls in disorder, covered with the dust in which they
                  were falling; his arm thrown over his face! In an instant she was kneeling by the
                  motionless figure.</p>
               <p>"Charlie Moore! Charlie!" There was inexpressible anguish in her low cry; but
                  there was neither motion nor response, nor sign of life.</p>
               <p>"God help me! God help me!" The lips were ghastly pale; the fingers trembled as
                  she tried to tear open his vest to find a death-wound—they refused to do her
                  bidding.</p>
               <p>"Dead! dead! dead! God help me to die!"</p>
               <p>And Mag lay senseless upon his breast.</p>
               <p>It was Charlie's turn to be frightened.</p>
               <p>"God forgive me!" he ejaculated in bitter remorse. He wound his arms tenderly
                  around her, folded her to his heart, smoothed back the dishevelled tresses from
                  the pale brow; kissed them softly—reverently; touched his lips to that marble
                  brow; sealed the closed lids with his fervent lips, and then his lips found those
                  other pale lips that had uttered such sweet music—music that would echo in his
                  soul forever; those fascinating, silent, beautiful lips. He fed upon them; drew
                  long, impassioned draughts of lightning bliss from their unstained purity, and at
                  last he woke her to life in his all-clasping embraces. Human nature could not
                  resist the temptation. Was she not all his own, for time and for eternity?</p>
               <p>"Where am I?" she asked, bewildered, as she unclosed the languid eyes, the mists
                  clearing away from their depths.</p>
               <p>"At home—on my heart, darling!" he whispered.</p>
               <p>It was heaven for her there. Why could she not remain?</p>
               <p>"I would risk my hopes of heaven to keep you here one hour, my beautiful!"</p>
               <p>Life came back with a rich bound, as she comprehended all. Why did she struggle
                  away from the heart and the arms where she longed to be folded forever? She tore
                  herself with all her strength from his passionate clasp, and fled homeward like a
                  frightened fawn. Charlie collected his scattered senses, passions, and soul, and
                  deliberated solemnly:</p>
               <p>"Taking all things into consideration, I approve of the dénoûment of the
                  performance. The experiment was valuable, and I cannot find an iota of true
                  repentance in my heart. The finale was the perfection of earthly experiences<pb
                     n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6426-00000107"/> riences. The lady manifested a
                  commendable discretion; it was the ring of true metal."</p>
               <p>But a little taunting imp whispered to him:</p>
               <p>"How do you know but the discretion itself was a pretty piece of feminine policy?
                  a little prudish acting? A woman will always be discreet with a man whose opinion
                  she values."</p>
               <p>And Charlie replied to the tormenting spirit:</p>
               <p>"She will never waste treasure by being indiscreet with a man she despises, or one
                  for whom she has no regard."</p>
               <p>Charlie gathered himself together, picked up his gun and went home, whistling
                  again as he went— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"The fruit that will fall without shaking</l>
                        <l>Is rather too mellow for me!"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>His forbidden fruit was getting to look like a fine cluster of grapes, hanging
                  just beyond his reach, but just near enough to tantalize him, as they tantalized
                  the fox who pronounced them sour.</p>
               <p>"How will the next chapter of the programme open? There will be some repentance,
                  and a confession of faith, perhaps."</p>
               <p>He met Frank as he entered his uncle's mansion.</p>
               <p>"What success in hunting," asked Frank.</p>
               <p>"The <emph>deer</emph> took fright—the bird took wing."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Of</emph> course. Do you give up the game?"</p>

               <p>"IS your heart in your mouth, Mag?" asked Frank, as he went after supper to
                  persuade her to come and sing with Lizzy at the Ross mansion. Charlie went to
                  invite her, and returned a little dismayed with the report from Aunt Lina, that
                  "Mag was sick—had come home half dead a little while before—she was on the lounge,
                  and refused to see Mr. Moore or any one else this evening."</p>
               <p>"Come, come, Mag; you and Charlie are not going to quarrel. Spit it out and behave
                  yourself. Charlie, poor fellow, is in the parlor dying to see you, and you are
                  going to see him too!"</p>
               <p>Frank picked Mag up, and forced her into the presence. Charlie met her with a
                  grave look of sorrowful concern.</p>
               <p>"Am I not to be forgiven?"</p>
               <p>"Of course," was the passive reply; but there came no smile to the pale lips.
                  Frank walked out after Uncle Alph.</p>
               <p>"Magdalene, if a mother, by some horrible blunder, had killed her beautiful
                  first-born, she could not repent it more sorrowfully than I regret having
                     <emph>wounded you!</emph> I would kill myself a thousand times, and tear my
                  heart from its throne before I would permit it even in thought to harm a hair of
                  your head."</p>
               <p>"It was a cruel device, Lieutenant Moore!"</p>
               <p>"But may I not be forgiven? If not, the punishment will be more cruel than the
                  device."</p>
               <p>"Certainly you are forgiven." But there was no smile.</p>
               <p>"Will you prove that you have forgiven me by going to Uncle Ross'?"</p>
               <p>"If Aunt Lina will give me permission!" Mag was really exhausted with emotion.
                  Strong spiritual life affects the nerves of the physical nature. Charlie saw her
                  listlessness.</p>
               <p>"All correct," said he to himself, as she went out. "I find no fault with her. If
                  she had done otherwise it might have spoilt the charm." He whistled an opera air,
                  with original variations, till she returned, continuing his sage reflections: "I
                  am sorry to be <emph>obliged</emph> to wound her, but it is decidedly the richest
                  event of nearly a quarter of a century of experience. The price I paid was not too
                  high. I would repeat the experiment under similar circumstances, for such is human
                  nature, and such is life!"</p>
               <p>Lizzy and Frank were especially brilliant in their performances during the
                  evening, whether musical or otherwise; Lizzy distinguished herself on the piano.
                  Mag, poor child, was obliged to exert all her powers to forget herself; she threw
                  her whole soul into song, to force it out of herself, consequently her eyes looked
                  inspiration, and Charlie watched those eyes—meanwhile being very busy talking with
                  Aunt Emma, on some very solemn subject. As he stood leaning at the entrance of an
                  open door, Frank was<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6426-00000108"/> intensely struck
                  with the devout expression of his face and figure, and wickedly called the
                  attention of the company.</p>
               <p>"Tableau vivant!" he called, with the accent of a play manager. "A <emph>glad
                     son</emph> maketh a <emph>wise father.</emph>" There was a laugh. Frank took a
                  position in an opposite door, and continued the Programme. "Companion picture! A
                     <emph>pretty son</emph> maketh a <emph>tickled mother!</emph>" and screwing up
                  his face and eyebrows into an intense expression of grim concentration, and giving
                  his shoulders a hitch sidewise, Aunt Emma declared that he looked so preciously
                  sweet she believed she was proud of him.</p>
               <p>Charlie went home with Mag, and Frank remarked to Lizzy on the occasion, as a
                  private and confidential fact, that "the stupidest business on earth was managing
                  a love affair for people who could not manage themselves; for his part he agreed
                  with Socrates in his opinion of Xantippe, expressed in that celebrated speech of
                  his before the Athenians; or he was not sure but it was Demosthenes, or, may be,
                  Anthony, in his address to Cleopatra over the body of Cæsar; some of the wise ones
                  at least, who said—or ought to have said, if they did not say it—that the most
                  unaccountable of all unaccountable flesh was a <emph>female!</emph> the most
                  disunderstandable of all disunderstandable things was a <emph>woman!</emph> the
                  most non-come-at-able of all non-come-at-able articles in flesh was a <emph>female
                     woman!</emph> Present company always excepted!"</p>
               <p>The next day the party of four went on a boating excursion.</p>
               <p>It was on a lovely lake, among the mountains, where every morning the silver
                  petalled water-lilies unclosed to show their golden hearts to the sun. <q>

                     </lg>
                  </q> exclaimed Mag, with a glad, rich emphasis, all her own. The sight of heaven
                  and earth, air, sky and water in their beauty was a daily miracle that intoxicated
                  her with gladness, spite of herself, and her spirits would run wild. She took the
                  oars with Frank, forgot Charlie, and gave herself up to the rich joy of her
                  perfect physical development; she exulted in the free play of swelling muscles,
                  the bound of the pulses, the thrill of the nerves—in all the exercise of the
                  powers of flesh and blood—her physical nature was a grand gift of God. She valued
                  it; worshipped physical strength and beauty; cultivated them as God intended she
                  should, with all the other 'talents' committed to her care, and her physical
                  health added glorious strength to her mental and moral nature.</p>
               <p>They rowed up through the current, lined with lilies on each side, which Lizzie
                  gathered as they passed, keeping time with the dip of their oars.</p>
               <p>"You are a grand little soul, taken altogether, Mag, and you are coming on
                  splendidly with your rowing! This is absolutely delicious! I shall certainly take

                  for our boats were vastly superior to theirs. They tried us in our boats after

               <p>"Now for the <emph>moral,</emph> Frank; don't miss that."</p>
               <p>"Genius without <emph>labor,</emph> will accomplish nothing. Genius with
                  discipline and training, can accomplish everything. Study, skill, tact, are the
                  levers of Archimedes, that can move the world. Those are my sentiments, after ages
                  of experience."</p>
               <p>They rowed up the stream, across the lake, under the shade of trees, and at last
                  rested upon their oars.</p>
               <p>It was a glorious thing to stand up and <emph>feel</emph> physical strength, to
                  inhale freedom in the fresh air, to bare the brow to the gaze of the sun, as
                  though they were his children, to feel the thrill of earth and heaven, for it was
                  heaven to know that true human hearts were together, throbbing their warm, rich
                  love-beat.</p>
               <p>At last, when the senses were sated with the very excess of loveliness, they
                  landed. Lizzy and Frank strolled into the woods, and Charlie challenged Mag to a
                  trial of skill with the oars. They rowed into the centre of the lake, stopped and
                  permitted the boat to rock upon the waves while they listened to the lullaby of
                  the waters, and the music in their hearts.</p>
               <p>"Why do you not take flight with your sisters the birds in the trees yonder? How
                  can you fold your restless wings here, Magdalene?"</p>
               <pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6426-00000109"/>
               <p>"My sisters, the skylarks, finished their songs long ago, and have permitted me to
                  come to you."</p>
               <p>"Brown and bonny <emph>mocking-bird,</emph> strayed from your warm passion-home
                  into this cold region, from the sunny South. You must return home to your own
                  climate and kindred with me. You must come to your <emph>home with me</emph>
                  there."</p>
               <p>"New England is my home." Mag's dark eye dilated as its glance swept over the
                  expanse of water, forest and sky. "Are the heavens of your home holier or purer
                  than these? Have you lovelier flowers, or clearer waters, or hills more glorious
                  than these 'everlasting hills'—these granite-browed mountains of New England?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, little mocking-bird; in the woods of Alabama you will never pine for
                  the beautiful; there are mountains as glorious, fountains as clear, skies as pure,
                  and hearts as holy, and warm, and true, to welcome you <emph>home</emph>
                  again."</p>
               <p>"Lucifer! Son of the morning!"</p>
               <p>"Arama—child of earth!"</p>
               <p>"I have no home! Your home will never, never, never be mine on earth—<emph>never
                     on earth!</emph>"</p>
               <p>The boat rocked gently under the smiling sky; the waters murmured on, lulling the
                  passion of the restless hearts. Charlie looked silently and reproachfully into the
                  eloquent face; its muscles and nerves were tremulous, the lips quivering, and
                  large, beaded drops gathering in the eyes. She averted her face from his
                  gaze—leaned over the boat's side, and the tears floated off with the bright
                  bubbles over the water. A grave smile broke over Charlie's lips, full of soft
                  pity, as a mother's over her sick, wayward child.</p>
               <p>"You are a proud creature, Mag. There has a terrible wrong made its home in your
                  nature, which is cankering its brightness. You <emph>must</emph> give me the key
                  to your heart; I claim it as my <emph>right.</emph> I <emph>must,</emph> as your
                  soul physician regulate its disease."</p>
               <p>"I deny your right to interfere with me, my heart, or my sins. You have no claim
                  on me, and I have no claim on you."</p>
               <p>"I claim my right as your <emph>cousin.</emph>"</p>
               <p>Mag looked up; a quizzical smile dawning through the tear-drops.</p>
               <p>"Yes, strange piece of human perversity. We are <emph>cousins,</emph> I can prove
                  it by Euclid."</p>
               <p>"Go on; you will enlighten benighted minds."</p>
               <p>"Own cousins—darling cousins—I am Frank's cousin— you are Frank's cousin. Euclid
                  says, 'Things equal to the same thing are equal to each other. <emph>We are
                     cousins.</emph> It is a mathematical demonstration, clear as light."</p>
               <p>"<emph>All light!</emph> Suppose Frank and I to be <emph>one.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Absurd! I could not even <emph>suppose</emph> it."</p>
               <p>"Frank is a <emph>son</emph> of his Alma Mater, Yale—ergo, I am a <emph>son</emph>
                  of Yale, for we are <emph>one.</emph> Can you prove anything else as luminously,
                     <emph>Cousin</emph> Charlie?"</p>
               <p>"I can prove that you are proud and vain."</p>
               <p>"By <emph>Euclid,</emph> cousin?"</p>
               <p>"Then you acknowledge the cousinship?"</p>
               <p>"How can I possibly fail to perceive it after such demonstration? Go on with your
                  proof."</p>
               <p>"You are <emph>proud,</emph> for you value your own opinions more highly than the
                  opinions of all the sons of men."</p>
               <p>"The sons of men tell me that my reason is a revelation from God to
                     <emph>me,</emph> for my own use; and the <emph>only</emph> reason in the
                  universe on which he intended <emph>I</emph> should rely. I am <emph>proud,</emph>
                  you say, because, as Emerson phrases it, my own measure is estimate enough; my own
                  praise is reward enough for me."</p>
               <p>"Jere Clemens, my townsman, says: 'I have, long since learned to bear both
                     <emph>praise</emph> and <emph>censure,</emph> even from the virtuous and
                  enlightened, with as much indifference as is consistent with a just pride of
                  character; when either comes from other sources it is never remembered.'"</p>
               <p>"And there is none righteous; no, not one. I have never found the
                     <emph>good</emph> man, whose opinions could in the least, avail me; it is my
                  misfortune, as well as my fault, that I cannot <emph>trust</emph> my kind, and
                  find no human goodness to <emph>reverence.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"You have a high ideal of perfection, and men do not approach it; you condemn them
                  for their failures, but not as you condemn yourself. You do condemn yourself with
                  a judgment as inexorable as death, you have no mercy on yourself."</p>
               <p>"But I do not <emph>judge</emph> my kind; I do try most earnestly to love
                  them."</p>
               <p>"You are too proud to judge the faults of others; you look down upon them with a
                  kind of weary pity, and spite of yourself, you are filled with utter contempt for
                  the pigmy aims, the paltry vanity and petty selfishness you see."</p>
               <p>"You judge my heart by your own. <emph>You</emph> have taken for your standard
                  Christ's command of Be ye <emph>perfect.</emph>"</p>
               <pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6426-00000110"/>
               <p>"You know, too, that <emph>humility</emph> is the cardinal virtue of the
                  wise."</p>
               <p>"One of the greatest <emph>arts</emph> taught by Christianity."</p>
               <p>"One taught by Socrates, four hundred years before the Christian era. You fear
                  that if humility is in you at all, it is <emph>potentially,</emph> not actually,
                  and you are cultivating it to the verge of insanity."</p>
               <p>"Go on, the <emph>demonstration</emph> is superb, if one could but see the
                  proof."</p>
               <p>"And you are <emph>vain;</emph> for little as you value the opinions of all other
                  men, you are anxious for my approval. You shrink from exposing your faults to my
                  gaze. It gives you mortal pangs when I experiment upon your heart disease."</p>
               <p>"You really think I have an affection of the heart, that you can experiment upon?
                  You have the presumption?"</p>
               <p>"The vanity, yes. You <emph>need love;</emph> your nature demands it—a part of
                  your nature is dying for it—becoming shadowy and dream-like, instead of a perfect
                  womanly nature, and I offer you the love you need, I entreat you to accept it—a
                  love worthy of you—royal enough to satisfy even your royal nature. You have no
                  right to famish your spirit, or fetter it. You have no right to deny it the boon
                  of life."</p>
               <p>"I acknowledge the faith in you, that a neophyte needs for her hierophant. Your
                  argument is almost omnipotent. Your appeal is entirely to my selfishness."</p>
               <p>"I have an argument that to you is mightier still—you see I am patient under your
                  pitiless sarcasm and irony—I look beneath the words, into the diseased heart; I
                  know you have learned the deep meaning of those words of the Man-God. It is more
                  blessed to <emph>give</emph> than to receive. Give yourself to me utterly,
                  Magdalene Barclay. You will never regret the gift."</p>
               <p>"You speak of the Man-God as your familiar friend; will you teach me to have faith
                  in him also?"</p>
               <p>"Magdalene!"</p>
               <p>Mag looked up into his face with a bright, rare smile.</p>
               <p>"You are a noble man, Charles Moore. Your friendship is the boon I most crave on
                  earth; but I puzzled my brain the other day with your argument from design, to
                  prove the existence of God, <emph>ignoring</emph> its truth—noting Bacon's method,
                  through Hobbes, Locke, Hume, and their kind, to atheism—tracing Kant through
                  Fichte, Schelling, Hegel, and their kind, to absolutism—and Des Cartes, through
                  Malebranche, Spinoza, and their kind, to fatalism."</p>
               <p>"You did? you daring soul."</p>
               <p>"I did, and then left the arguments on the existence of God for those on the
                  existence of the Man-God whom you quote, and have arrived at Strauss and his
                  myths."</p>
               <p>"Do they disturb you?"</p>
               <p>"No, it would require a miraculous faith, to believe that there were separate
                  myths enough to account for all Christ's miracles, or to believe that John the
                  Evangelist was what Strauss pronounced him, a willful liar and impostor. Neander
                  made me <emph>doubt</emph> more than Strauss."</p>
               <p>"Go on—go on—go on!"</p>
               <p>"Don't make grimaces, it spoils your beauty, <emph>cousin,</emph> and I believe
                  you pride yourself on your looks."</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"If, as Neander says, Christ's disciples, who lived with him, listened to his
                  wonderful eloquence, and drank of his life for a year, if they could not
                  comprehend his spirit, or understand his mission with the miraculous aid he gave,
                  is it <emph>possible</emph> for <emph>men</emph> to <emph>know</emph> the life and
                  spirit of Christ? To the very last they were deceived. To the last they could not
                  understand that his kingdom was a spiritual kingdom, that heaven was to be in
                  their hearts. To the last they thought his kingdom to be of <emph>this
                     world;</emph> and De Quincey, who says that the early <emph>Christians</emph>
                  manufactured the history of Christ in Josephus, excuses Judas for betraying him,
                  saying, that Judas knew that the prince had miraculous power, and thought that
                  when driven to self-defence, he would use it, not only to save himself, but his
                  nation, and would then establish his throne among his people."</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"My experience of men is limited. I have never known a consistent Christian
                  minister or man, who would not have been as consistent and noble without his
                  religion. I do know self-righteous and vain-glorious Christian professors."</p>
               <p>"And you <emph>may</emph> know that business men become church members, because it
                  is good business policy, and you <emph>may</emph> know that vile men do it to
                  conceal their vileness, and vile women wear religion as a mask for iniquity, or to
                  save an endangered reputation."</p>
               <p>"You frighten me, Charlie."</p>
               <pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6426-00000111"/>
               <p>"You were severe, Magdalene."</p>
               <p>"I say it in all sorrow and humility. I say it to my cousin, who is not a
                  professed Christian; if he were, I would watch my words, fearing he might feel it
                  his duty, for Christ's sake, to injure me by calling me a skeptic. If I knew one
                  human being who had learned of <emph>Christ</emph> to be self-denying and
                  forgiving, one who had learned the <emph>deep</emph> meaning of humility, and the
                     <emph>deep</emph> meaning of those words: Be not overcome of evil, but
                     <emph>overcome evil with good,</emph> under wrongs that wring the last fibre of
                  nature, and under temptations like those of the Man-God in the wilderness, then I
                  could believe that Christianity was no farce, but the gift of God to a
                  sin-stricken world."</p>
               <p>"You will yet solve the problem by your own life."</p>
               <p>"Do you believe that men ever have solved the problem by their lives?"</p>
               <p>"Do you doubt it?"</p>
               <p>"How can I help doubting, when we see, for one example out of many, contests in
                  the theological world, like that of Parks of Andover, and Hodges of Princeton,
                  carried to such lengths that the world say the men <emph>hate</emph> each
                  other?"</p>
               <p>"The world probably say wrong."</p>
               <p>"Such a contest, carried to such lengths, by such men, even if but logomachy, as
                  we believe, is a scandal, and makes us reprobates outside the sanctuary, doubt
                  Christ their master. You tell me of those contests in Alabama among the Baptists
                  and other denominations, the Theodosia Ernests and Theophilus Waltons, with
                  accompaniments of newspaper squibs, and vituperation in pamphlets, carried to such
                  an extent, that the world blushes for a religion that appears in such guise. All
                  history is full of such Christianity, such <emph>battles</emph> for the
                     <emph>letter of the law</emph> of Christ, till the spirit becomes the spirit of
                  the Prince of Darkness, which says: Now abideth Love, Faith, Form, and the
                  greatest of these is <emph>Form.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"But believe it, Mag, there is a <emph>true</emph> spirit that sorrows with a
                  great indignation, when men so give themselves up to the <emph>false</emph>
                  spirit. Many a man has learned of <emph>Christ</emph> that secret of humility.
                  What can you say of Augustine, of Loyola, of Xavier, before the time of Protestant
                  Luther and Calvin? What of the martyrs?"</p>
               <p>"And what do you say of the Hindoo devotees, and all the enthusiasts who have said
                  it was a blessed thing to die for country—those like Regulus and Curtius for Rome,
                  and Charlotte Corday for France, and the thousands in history that time would fail
                  to mention?"</p>
               <p>"At least, I will say, it proves a divinity in humanity. Go on, Mag, let me see
                  all the disorder in your nature. This is your disease; this is what suffering has
                  taught you, Together, <emph>you and I</emph> will search for the remedy. Even if
                  the disorder we see in this world must continue through all eternity; yet if we
                  can be <emph>together</emph> in the mingled good and evil, the love we cherish for
                  each other shall bring us bliss, pure and fresh, and sweet, and we will still
                  build heaven in our hearts."</p>
               <p>"And do you suppose the heaven the Bible tells us of has undergone change since it
                  was heaven? How came those holy beings in heaven, where no sin is, to conceive the
                  idea of sin and rebellion at the time when Satan was first chained to the
                  bottomless pit? Were they in a state of trial and probation then in heaven? Is
                  heaven still a state of probation to men and angels, or has it changed since the
                  angels fell?"</p>
               <p>"There, my child, you have asked questions enough for one day. Of the Bible I will
                  say now, it is the <emph>only</emph> standard of religion and morality that we
                  have; the <emph>only</emph> guide to purity and holiness. We must take this or
                  nothing. Reason and nature may be guides to the cultivated few; to the masses they
                  would be blind leaders of the blind; the <emph>simple faith</emph> in the God of
                  Love, revealed in the Bible, is suited to the deepest wants of the masses, and
                  will be their salvation. I will tell you on next Sunday what I think of all these

               <p>Mag's heart throbbed wildly.</p>
               <p>"My young eagle! Prometheus was bound to a barren rock with adamantine chains, and
                  a hungry vulture tearing at his vitals, because he dared confer a blessing upon
                  mortals contrary to the will of Zeus. Happy God! happy in the consciousness that
                  he was unjustly afflicted because he dared do <emph>right.</emph> Do not flatter
                  yourself that you are in any way following his example; do not become your own
                  vulture, to learn the power of the spirit to subdue flesh; do not commit such
                  ghastly suicide. Let me save you from that living death. Like Prometheus, you
                  shall breathe the <emph>fire</emph> of your life into the <emph>clay</emph> of
                  mine till we both become immortal."</p>
               <p>"Frank and Lizzy are calling us, Charlie!"</p>
               <p>"If your spirit is in the dust, mine will lift it up to redemption; when mine goes
                  down to regions of night and darkness, you shall descend as my saviour and
                  redeemer, and bring light into gloom."</p>
               <p>"They are calling us, Cousin Charlie!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Magdalene Barclay, the voices of Nature herself are calling. Why do you not
                  answer the call? My heart has stopped its beat to listen for your words."</p>
               <p>Magdalene Barclay's soul was speechless—for there was no language to interpret her
                  thought. The voices of nature answered their own call. In silence the two received
                  the apocalypse.</p>
               <p>The little boat rocked softly upon the waters, with its freight of human
                  happiness—the two immortal souls with their earth dreams. The spirits of nature
                  gathered around them, smiled upon them, and then went upon their destined way.
                  Millions and millions of busy spirits went smiling to their work; they floated
                  among the forest trees, tinting their garments with green, and adding gems of
                  ruby, topaz and pearl; they poured fresh streams of life into the veins of the
                  old, oaks; they embraced the white-robed blossoms, and added pearls and silver
                  crowns as if for a bridal. The crimson blossoms flushed deeper as they passed, and
                  scarlet creepers clung with a fonder clasp around the brown, gnarled trunks, and
                  blushed as they filled the chalices with new nectar and ambrosia as for a
                  feast-day among gods; soft lipped flowers lifted modest eyes to drink the azure
                  from the sky; the sun kissed their dewy lids; sweet star flowers of earth that had
                  answered the nightly gaze of the stars in heaven, and dreamed smilingly of their
                  love by day; they saw those human blossoms, lovelier and costlier than all earth
                  beside, for their life was immortality. The spirits of nature gathered around the
                  children of earth, and enfolded them with passionate fervor in their all-clasping
                  embraces. From the mountain streams and the lake's bosom the spirits of nature
                  gathered to them, and sweet laughter echoed to the passion-breathing hearts.</p>
               <p>From the sky, on the silver wings of sunbeams, in garments of azure, they gathered
                  around; while sailing away on golden and crimson clouds were myriads upon myriads
                  of happy spirits, their pinions glittering, and the echoes of their songs filled
                  the souls of the earthly dreamers of royal dreams; it was the song, too, of the
                  morning stars; the music of the distant spheres—"There is a God! God's universe is
                  beautiful! The great heart of the universe throbs on forever, and the life of the
                  universal heart is <emph>love!</emph>"</p>
               <p>Love! Strange, beautiful love—that caused the Son of God to leave his home in the
                  bosom of the Father—to leave that companionship with angels to atone in woe,
                  solitude, temptation in the wilderness, and death upon the cross, for a world's
                  ruin. Strange, holy love, that can sanctify sin, guilt and crime itself, and give
                  one ray of heaven to pollution! Who may know the agony of longing with which the
                  Son looked up for love into the Father's face, when, in the darkness of his utter
                  desolation, his mighty heart was broken, and the wild, wailing cry rent earth and
                  heaven with its agony—"My God! my God! <emph>why</emph> hast <emph>Thou</emph>
                  forsaken me?"</p>
               <p>The Father, out of his own love for his children of earth, permitted that
                  sacrifice of love by the only begotten Son of heaven; he then commanded the
                  thunders to speak, the graves to open, and the dead to rise, and testify that Love
                  was ruler in earth as in heaven!</p>
               <p>The man made in the image of God repeated to the woman, made out of man, the
                  solemn words:</p>
               <p>"Love! glorious Love! bowing with reverential joy, we receive thy benediction.
                  Hope! soft-eyed, radiant Hope, we receive thy blessing! And Faith!—thy dark eye
                  lifted upward—from thee we receive the coronation robes, the sceptre and the
                  crown. With <emph>Faith</emph> we work out our <emph>immortal destiny!</emph>"</p>

               <head>XIX. THE SABBATH.</head>
               <p>"THE great thoughts, the great joys, and the great sorrows of life stand out like
                  pyramids."</p>
               <p>It was a glorious morning in nature's harvest time; one of those
                     <emph>perfect</emph> days when all earth and heaven are full of worship, and
                  immortal spirits <emph>feel</emph> God.</p>
               <p>One of God's <emph>perfect</emph> days, one in which existence itself was bliss;
                  when all the wild cravings of human hearts were still, sleeping, and the heart
                  satisfied in gathering the golden grain of life's harvest time. One of God's
                     <emph>perfect</emph> days, when the soul bows itself in humility, in loving
                  content and grateful adoration, for its very fullness of blessing. Nature was
                  wearing her garments of rejoicing, and her royal treasure-house was open. Not a
                  frown clouded her smile in heaven, to remind the heavy-laden of their forgotten
                  weariness; or to foreshadow in the future, the new pangs—the doom of the yet to be
                  broken-hearted, in which, drop by drop, the earth life, in untold anguish, would
                  ooze itself away.</p>
               <p>One of God's <emph>perfect</emph> days, in which soul-weary dreamers send the
                  crushed spirit to introspect the broken hearts, where so many, many wild dreams
                  are hushed to silence forever—hearts where hopes so surpassing sweet have been
                  crushed into early graves. Softly treading over the graves of their darlings,
                  there, they smile as the memory of their radiant young beauty flushes before them,
                  and they search carefully, hearts <emph>filled</emph> with the graves of wrecked,
                  blighted, and buried hopes, and smile again, because they know there cannot be
                  found room for even one other sepulchre; and while they smile, sunshine from a far
                  region of thrones pours its brightness on the hallowed places, and voices whisper,
                  that hope is immortal, and cannot rest in graves forever. It will rise from
                  degradation with spotless, replumed pinions, purified from its mortification,
                  unpolluted and forever free, will find its home by the rivers of the waters of
                  life, where the tree of life bears twelve manner of fruits, whose leaves are for
                  the healing of nations.</p>
               <p>A <emph>perfect</emph> Sabbath day was breaking over the hills and valleys of New
                  England, into the hearts and homes of the descendants of the Puritans. The Sabbath
                  bells broke the silence, and upon the stillness their solemn call went forth for
                  Puritan worshippers, to come up to the house of God, and many a worshipper
                  answered the call.</p>
               <p>Grey-haired men and women, with their venerable bowed forms, went slowly up;
                  worshippers of the living God; robust yeomanry went up, worshippers of mammon, and
                  the young went up, noble youths and graceful maidens, worshippers of the creature,
                  instead of the Creator; and sunnyeyed, innocent children went up, with only the
                  unblossomed <emph>germs</emph> of depravity in their unpolluted souls, of whom the
                  Divine Man said, "Of such is the kingdom of heaven." All went up to worship in the
                  sanctuary of the Most High God.</p>
               <p>In Glenlyn, Grandfather Barclay went slowly up the aisles, leaning upon his staff,
                  and with his <emph>heart's</emph> worship, he lifted his blind eyes vainly upward
                  toward the throne.</p>
               <p>And Grandmother Barclay went up with him; she took her place by his side, and
                  lifted her spectacles to look where her heart was, in the eyes of her
                     fellow-<emph>men.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Josie Newton and her kind went up the broad aisles also, amid the flutter of
                  silks, and the spread of crinoline, like banners waving on Sabbath breezes, and
                  furling the folds of their garments; even there, in the sanctuary, they opened a
                  battery of flashing glances to win conquest and worship; and "gentry" came, saw,
                  and were conquered by the metallic charms, invincible in a siege of hearts. There
                  in the House of God, the belles did not scruple to wring those hearts, in all
                  their changes, and fasten captives of the susceptible to the train of their
                  triumphal chariots. And for conquests like these to win worship, they flushed
                  their cheeks into blushes of carmine, blooded their lips into exquisite
                  love-pouts, by the perfection of art, paled their <emph>lily-white</emph>
                  complexions into many a sea-shell tint, where corals and rubies combined in
                  fascinating confusion with roses and lilies. These, as they took their places in
                  the house of worship, deposited their hearts on the fitting shrines, where they,
                  too, were worshippers.</p>
               <p>Socrates Wilson dragged his slow length up the aisle, and seated his worshipful
                  dignity, also—his philosophy not<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6426-00000114"/> having
                  yet been emancipated from its devotion to <emph>self</emph>-knowledge, and not yet
                  having attained the world-philosophy of Shakspeare's Wolsey: "Love <emph>thyself
                     last;</emph> cherish those hearts that hate thee." His wife, Xantippe, with her
                  jewels, like those of Cornelia, crept into her place at his side, and, woman-like,
                  her heart was with her jewels. Where the treasure is, there the heart is
                  worshipping.</p>
               <p>Magdalene Barclay went up also—up to her place by the organ, among those who were
                  to sing praises, and May Burton, as was her custom, glided into the seat by her
                  side. On this wonderful Sabbath, Mag gazed up into the joy of heaven, and saw new
                  tints in the celestial radiance, and alas! was conscious of another mysterious
                     <emph>presence</emph> in her heart, than the one whom she was called to
                  worship, and her soul was troubled with the very fullness of its content.</p>
               <p>For down among the congregation, by the side of Lizzy Moore and Frank Ross, was
                  Charles Atherton Moore, whom she worshipped. He, the professed adorer of the
                     <emph>Divine,</emph> whether incarnated in loveliness like that of Magdalene
                  Barclay, with her physical, intellectual and moral growth, or whether manifest in
                  any of its earthly attributes of long-suffering, humility and love; or whether
                  overshadowing human hearts with mysterious stillness, the holy, breathing
                  presence, the unutterable, illimitable, unfathomable <emph>Idea,</emph> named the
                     <emph>Infinite God.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>It was the Communion Sabbath.</p>
               <p>The aged pastor, over whose wrongs Grandfather Barclay had so grieved, had gone to
                  his rest and reward at last; perhaps in that better land he was pouring out love
                  and blessing upon his unworthy flock, with Christ's prayer: "Father, forgive them,
                  for they know not what they do." Mr. Brown, his successor, was absent—gone to
                  search a new field of labor among minds of a higher order—fitted to appreciate the
                  poetry of his thought. On that day, Father McLean, the <emph>blind</emph> pastor
                  of a neighboring church, was to officiate in dispensing the Word of Life.</p>
               <p>As the tones of the bell ceased to vibrate, the blind patriarch went slowly up
                  into the desk, guided by, and leaning on the arm of his son.</p>
               <p>A hush fell upon the worshippers as he entered; every heart was hushed, and tears
                  blinded many eyes, as they are blinding mine, for my pen is plagiarizing from
                  memory, and not from the Blind Preacher of William Wirt.</p>
               <p>His face was one a Raphael might have studied, as his embodied conception of a
                  prophet. The sad, solemn, loving look, the impress of untold thought and sorrow,
                  the seal of power to subdue strong human passions. Eighty years had crowned him,
                  yet his voice was full, with a tremulous eloquence that awed every heart—he, too,
                  spoke as one "having authority." Men felt that in the experience of fiery thought
                  that tries men's souls, he knew whereof he spoke. Many a lip quivered; many a
                  heart swelled with purifying tears at his words.</p>
               <p>Grandfather Barclay, who sat leaning his head upon his staff, felt the
                     <emph>presence</emph> as he passed; he lifted his sightless eyes with an
                  unconscious, and alas, vain effort, to look once more into the face of the long
                  beloved, but he bowed himself again. With the <emph>eye of faith</emph> he saw
                  him, and looked forward to another greeting in their <emph>home.</emph>
                     "<emph>There</emph> shall be no more <emph>curse,</emph> and they shall
                     <emph>see</emph> God's face, and his name shall be in their foreheads, and
                  there shall be no <emph>night</emph> there, and they need no candle nor light of
                  the sun, for the Lord God giveth them light, and they shall reign forever and
                  ever."</p>
               <p>The pastor bowed reverently his tall venerable form, in the presence of the Most
                  High; the morning invocation winged its way up to the throne, there was a hush for
                  the blessing to descend. The morning hymn was repeated with strange, solemn
                  cadence by those hallowed lips; the tones of the organ swelled, vibrated, and died
                  away, floating heavenward, and there was silence.</p>
               <p>It was the Communion Sabbath. Leaning for support on the desk, the pastor
                  repeated, with his deep, tremulous thrill, the Evangel of the angels to the
                  shepherds of Bethlehem, who watched their flocks by night. "Fear not, for behold I
                  bring unto you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people, for unto
                  you is born this day in the City of David, a <emph>Saviour,</emph> which is Christ
                  the Lord."</p>
               <p>The story of Jesus was repeated as it has been repeated, and will be repeated by
                  sad human lips, countless millions of times to sad human hearts, until his second
                  coming in the clouds of heaven.</p>
               <p>He told the story of Jesus—not alone, he said, the ambassador from the courts of
                  heaven, not an angel sent to represent that glory to the fallen sons of men, to
                  care for its interests and demand its dues, but Jesus Christ the
                     <emph>Lord,</emph> Jesus <emph>Emanuel,</emph> the <emph>only begotten Son of
                     God.</emph>
               </p>
               <pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6426-00000115"/>
               <p>He said, those men must be <emph>mistaken,</emph> who represented God as one
                  between whom and the human soul there was only a mutual attraction, for man then
                  would not have rebelled, would have needed no at-one-ment, being already <emph>at
                     one</emph> with God, man then would not require <emph>grace,</emph> for an
                  upright nature would be inclined to truth, reason would have the supremacy over
                  revelation, for it would be the direct voice of truth, while revelation may have
                  been corrupted, or but speak obscurely when clothed in human words.</p>
               <p>There was then a <emph>necessity</emph> for a Saviour to a disobedient and
                  rebellious race. God the Father saw the <emph>necessity,</emph> and stretched
                  forth his hand to save his people. He sent as his mediator, not Christ the man
                  alone, for what new knowledge could man unfold to his fellow-man of the mysteries
                  of a heaven he had never known? How could man be an ambassador for a king and
                  kingdom, of whose laws and thoughts he was as ignorant as his fellow man? The
                  minister from the Courts of Heaven must have <emph>full</emph> knowledge of the
                  interests he came to represent, and a finite man could not comprehend or unfold
                  the thought of an Infinite God. Not even an angel did the Father send as his
                  minister to earth, for angels had fallen in heaven, and on earth had loved the
                  daughters of men, because they were fair; God the Father sent, as his mediator, an
                  Infinite Being, God, the only begotten Son, the Prince of Peace, to redeem his
                  fallen world from the curse of sin, the disobedience of <emph>his law.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>He portrayed Jesus—Strauss of Germany had pronounced the story of Jesus a
                  fabrication, and his miracles but myths. Strauss had called Luke the Evangelist a
                  false historian, and on one point of history, Olshauser was not able to refute
                  him; but a Roman coin just discovered, had, as by a special providence, proved
                  Luke's dates perfectly accurate. Strauss had worked himself into the belief that
                  John the Beloved knew Jesus as an impostor, and was therefore a willful liar.
                  Unhappy Strauss. The life of Jesus Christ our Lord was a matter of history, so
                  well authenticated, and so universally believed by men, that <emph>all
                     history</emph> bears date from the year of the birth of that Redeemer.</p>
               <p>The Evangelists did not describe Jesus, but his contemporaries had done it.
                  Publius Lutulus, Governor of Judea, described him to Cæsar, Emperor at Rome, and
                  Napoleon found the description in the public records at Rome. Jesus, "a man of
                  surpassing beauty, excelling the children of men; a man of sad, solemn presence;
                  none had seen him smile, but many had seen him weep; in speaking, modest and wise;
                  in admonishing, courteous; in reproving, <emph>terrible;</emph> by the Gentiles
                  accepted as a great prophet of great truth, for he had cured all manner of
                  disease, and raised the dead, but by his own disciples called the Son of God."</p>
               <p>He portrayed the matchless humility of Jesus. Philosophers, in their furthest
                  conceptions, had never been able to dream of such humility. The Prince of Heaven
                  had descended from his eternal throne, had given up the adoration of cherubim and
                  seraphim, had given up all the heavensweet bliss of the Father's unutterable,
                  infinite love, had come down to the stable at Bethlehem, been for degradation born
                  of a <emph>virgin</emph>—or as that daring theist, Theodore Parker, expressed it,
                  he became the bastard baby of a Hebrew girl—he had been cradled in a manger, that
                  the lowliest born of earth might know, that he with them had tasted every dreg in
                  the deepest cup of human infamy and ignominy.</p>
               <p>He portrayed the love of the Christ for sinners, the seraphic sweetness of his
                  glance, filled with its far unfathomable light, that he shed in dewy pity upon the
                  tempted and broken hearted, the thief on the cross, and the Magdalene beneath it.
                  His tones of persuasive eloquence were calling continually to the down-pressed,
                  "Come unto me, all ye that are <emph>weary</emph> and heavy-laden, and I will give
                  you <emph>rest.</emph>" Had he not been weary, as man was never weary before? He
                  had wandered in the wilderness, tempted of devils, he had received from men hatred
                  and cursing that revealed the demons within them, and then his human heart had
                  sickened in inexpressible longing for his <emph>lost love</emph> in heaven. Those
                  who had never known the passionate rapture and agony of human love, could never
                  dream of its bliss. None but he who had lost a heaven, could conceive the faintest
                  idea of His anguish of pining for that <emph>lost love</emph> and life in heaven.
                  Jesus was human, he had known the darkest, strongest, wildest, deepest temptations
                  that humanity could know, and now he would pour into bleeding, tempted human
                  hearts, the balm of his Infinite pity and love. The weary and sin-sick, should go
                  to the Man-God in their great sorrow, without fear. Fear not, he would give them
                  good tidings of great joy.</p>
               <p>Was there a parent or lover whose heart was aching to<pb n="230-231"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000116"/> see in the soul of some beloved one, God's image
                  becoming defaced and degraded by sin, becoming <emph>daily</emph> more and more
                  blotted, till the horror of blackness was settling down on its original beauty?
                  Let such come to Jesus in their agony of supplication for the redemption of that
                  lost beauty from heaven. Jesus died for those whose souls were marred by
                     <emph>sin;</emph> not the righteous, but <emph>sinners</emph> he came to
                     <emph>save.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Was there some child of genius, wayward and misguided perhaps, struggling with
                  blight, crushed by want—his whole being suffocating with a never-gratified thirst
                  for its native element, the beautiful—till in the extremity of sorrow he had
                     <emph>doubted</emph> whether a <emph>God</emph> ruled the destinies of the
                  world? Was there such an erring and tempted child of genius, forced to herd with
                  the ignoble, denied all communion with the good, and all interlife with the true,
                  till he had become blind, and deaf, and dumb to the proof of God's existence,
                  God's purity, God's truth, and God's love? Let that sinblighted child come to
                  Christ. He, too, had prayed for escape from woe and temptation. "If it be
                  possible, let this cup pass from me!" He, too, had <emph>doubted God</emph> in his
                  hour of agony. "My God, my God, <emph>why hast thou forsaken me?</emph>"</p>
               <p>Was there some soul of far-grasping range of intellect, some soul whose vision,
                  reaching out in advance of the ages, looked down in weary sorrow upon the pitiful
                  contests fretting the masses as they were borne, upheld and guided by an
                  over-ruling Providence, upon the advancing waves of progress? Was there some man,
                  like a Galileo, imprisoned for having discovered truth; a Columbus, in the power
                  of ignorance and lust, that would build dungeons of ignorance for the times and
                  nations, and call men blasphemers who would open the doors to let in light and
                  knowledge? Was there a Socrates, martyred by the passions of an ignorance mighty
                  in evil? Let such men now come to Jesus of Nazareth. He, too, had lived in the
                  desert solitude of thought, ages beyond the ken of disciple, prophet, priest or
                  king. He had been scourged, buffeted, mocked, spit upon, sweat drops of blood,
                  been crowned with thorns, and <emph>crucified</emph> for truth. He had brought to
                  those whose seething passions poured curses upon him, light, knowledge, freedom
                  and joy. Let such men come to Jesus; he would give them good tidings; they should,
                  like him, find death the portals of freedom—the gates of immortal truth! It hath
                  not entered into the heart of man to conceive the gifts laid up by the Father for
                  his children—all knowledge, and honor and joy!</p>
               <p>Then the tremulous cadences quivered into each heart, as he gave the earnest
                  appeal for <emph>all</emph> to come to Jesus and learn those sublime secrets of
                  humility and forgiveness, by which the image of God might be restored to their
                  souls; to come and learn of Jesus to be meek and lowly in heart.</p>
               <p>The bread was given—with a hush like a suppressed sob upon each heart, "the body
                  of Christ broken for sinners"—and the wine was poured, "the blood of Christ shed
                  for sin."</p>
               <p>Mag had <emph>doubted</emph> this God and this Christ, and her heart grew hot as
                  she listened. Charles Moore's brow had paled at the prophet-like cadences of the
                  majestic old man.</p>
               <p>The last hymn arose, the benediction hovered over the bowed heads and hearts.</p>
               <p>Grandfather Barclay arose and leaned his tall form again upon his staff. As Mag
                  saw his helpless, patient look of subdued eagerness, the tears gushed from some
                  sealed fountain, and cooled the hot fever in her heart. He waited patiently to
                  grasp, for the last time before eternity, the hand of the adored blind pastor.</p>
               <p>He came at last, trusting his own helpless hand to the guidance of his son. The
                  two hands met then through that thick darkness; the long, friendly clasp was
                  given, kind, tremulous words of greeting and blessing were exchanged, and then the
                  fathers of Israel were guided on their way to meet no more on earth—to rest awhile
                  in earthly homes before their journey to the better country where thought is all
                  light.</p>
               <p>"Were those words <emph>truth to you,</emph> Cousin Charlie?" asked Mag, as they
                  strolled slowly homeward. She looked up with a wistful earnestness into his face,
                  as though life or death lay in his reply. He caught the look and answered it only
                  with a smile.</p>
               <p>"If that is <emph>truth,</emph> the Christ will indeed satisfy all the wants of
                  our nature. Do <emph>you</emph> believe that story of the Nazarene?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>I believe!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"And <emph>I</emph> believe. I <emph>will</emph> believe! Lord help mine
                  unbelief!" Mag said, fervently.</p>
               <p>"And what more than this do you <emph>believe,</emph> Cousin Charlie? You promised
                  to tell me to-day."</p>
               <p>There was something touching and wistful in her subdued tones, yet something so
                  arch and winning in their sweetness, that just then Charles Moore had no heart or
                  head to<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6426-00000117"/>
                  <emph>believe</emph> in anything but human grace. His only reply was a look of
                  undisguised love.</p>
               <p>"You promised me your <emph>creed</emph> to-day. Do you not
                  <emph>remember?</emph>"</p>
               <p>Charlie <emph>remembered</emph>—much more than that promise. He recalled his
                  soul—permitted his glance to sweep earth and sky; he lifted the black, clustering
                  curls as he stopped, bared his brow and heart to the gaze of heaven, and his
                  neophyte.</p>
               <p>"What do you <emph>believe,</emph> Charlie Moore?"</p>
               <p>A sudden smile wreathed his lip, as he drank in the beauty of earth: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">

               <p>Mag looked up to catch his tone of fervor.</p>
               <p>"Death shall be no more forever! Do you <emph>believe</emph> it?" said Mag.</p>
               <p>"I <emph>believe</emph> we shall <emph>live forever</emph> and
                     <emph>forever,</emph> and STILL FOREVER!"</p>
               <p>"You and I, Charlie?"</p>
               <p>"And I <emph>believe</emph> it will be a glorious thing to learn with you, Mag,
                  all that God intended we should learn in his universe. The first lessons of love

                     <emph>all</emph> it can teach us of joy before we go to that marriage in the
                  hereafter. We will be rovers and wanderers together, you and I, Mag. We will visit
                  those lands of the Orient, where the Man-God accomplished his mission; we have
                  been there often in dreams; we will shake the dust from our tired feet in
                  Palestine, the land of pilgrims, and when the dust of worldly selfishness is
                  stifling the divine within us, and the hot blast of worldly passion would make my
                  heart a desert, we will lie down for rest by the rivers of Babylon, and your voice
                  shall be my music, your fingers shall soothe the fever in my temples. We will find
                  the ruins of Eden, and build another Eden more thrillingly sweet than Eden ever
                  could have been before ruin entered it. We shall walk among ruins in all our life
                  wanderings. Earth is strewn with ruins; we shall find them in human hearts. We
                  will permit no ruin to desecrate our own hearts; in other hearts we will hallow
                  the ruins—the devastations of sin—we will pour into them balm from Gilead, and
                  bring to them garments of joy"——</p>
               <p>He stopped—a look of intense pain in Mag's dark eye arrested him—a look of wonder
                  at his infatuated earthdreams. He answered the look in softened, reproachful
                  tones.</p>
               <p>"Magdalene Barclay! do you yet cherish the mad idea that having once tasted the
                  love I lavish upon you, for which your heart is fainting, the world will be
                  endurable to you without it? Do you remember what you have heard to-day? 'They who

               <p>Mag struggled to force down her heart, that was rising in rebellion at her insane
                  denial of its <emph>rights.</emph> She said, sadly:</p>
               <p>"Tell me more of the <emph>God</emph> in whom you believe."</p>
               <p>Charlie answered her with a strange, rare smile that fluttered down into her
                  heart, <emph>almost</emph> subduing it.</p>
               <p>"I believe him to be an <emph>Omniscient</emph> God. He <emph>fore</emph>-knew all
                  things. The Bible tells us that from before the foundations of the world he
                  predestinated his Son to die for the sins of the world, and I <emph>believe</emph>
                  it. I believe him to be an <emph>Omnipotent</emph> God. He had the power to
                  prevent the entrance of sin. His omnipotence was able to create a being with a
                     <emph>free will,</emph> and make that being <emph>accountable</emph> for its
                  acts. I <emph>believe</emph> God has done this. Where the accountability lies in
                  the being thus created, or where the will is located—whether, as the theologians
                  say, in the 'arbitrium' or the 'underlying arbitrium'—I know not, nor does any
                  other human being know, nor will any other human being <emph>ever</emph> know,
                  till Omniscience reveals it! I <emph>believe,</emph> I say, that God has used his
                  omnipotence, has given man a <emph>free will,</emph> and made him
                     <emph>accountable</emph> for his own <emph>fate.</emph>
                  <emph>Why</emph> God has done this, I do not know. <emph>Why</emph> God
                     <emph>predestinated sin,</emph> I do not know, not being omniscient; but I
                     <emph>believe</emph> the God of the universe to be a God of infinite wisdom and
                  of infinite love. I believe he has done it for <emph>good.</emph> I believe sin to
                  be a great <emph>evil,</emph> but, because a God of <emph>love
                     predestinated</emph> it, I<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6426-00000118"/> believe a
                  greater good is to result from it. The universe, with all its sin and sorrow, is
                  as it <emph>ought</emph> to be. There has been no <emph>mistake</emph> in any of
                  its arrangements, for it was founded by an omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient God
                  of love."</p>
               <p>"Frank used to teach me that, years ago," said Mag, "when we were children and
                  puzzling over the mysteries of <emph>pain and sorrow.</emph> Can you solve any of
                  those mysteries for me now, Cousin Charlie?"</p>
               <p>"In the eyes of the All-Father, the children of earth are but little lower than
                  the angels, and destined for a life far nobler. To fit them for their destiny,
                  they were endowed with their threefold or triune nature—the physical, intellectual
                  and moral, so perfectly blended, it is impossible to draw a line between their
                  interlife. The spiritual and intellectual give that lofty beauty to the physical
                  which reveals the divine in humanity; it is the crowning charm in your beauty, the
                  grace in you which I most love and worship; it plays over your lips, hovers in
                  your eyes, breathes in your form"——</p>
               <p>"Charles Moore!"</p>
               <p>There was real anguish in those eyes then.</p>
               <p>"With its garb of clay and flesh, the divine spirit took the taint of sin—the
                  synonym of misery. But by sorrow—by stern wrestling with temptation and conquering
                  the tempter within, by the strong struggle after the divine—the immortal within
                  man is disciplined for its high destiny. Those endowed with the most perfect
                  physical development must have the fiercest struggle with passion. You and I, who
                  have cultivated the physical into perfect health, who rejoice in the play of
                  muscle and the throb of pulses, must be wary, lest, in unguarded moments, the
                  earthly passion may rise and force the <emph>divine</emph> to a base servitude; if
                  so, heaven help us! for the image of God in our souls will become dim! The
                  physical should become <emph>servant</emph> to the divine, should
                     <emph>obey</emph> the intellectual and moral, or it will be out of harmony with
                  truth, and the atmosphere of the good will bring it torture, and heaven itself
                  become hell. I believe in hell, Magdalene Barclay—earth would become hell to me,
                  if you turned devil; and so would heaven itself—but you are to be my guardian
                  angel!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Cousin</emph> Charlie!"</p>
               <p>"Magdalene Barclay! you are a <emph>perfect</emph> woman," he said, with a grave
                  smile. "You are <emph>believing</emph> all this that I am telling you, not because
                  there is <emph>reason</emph> in it, but because I tell you that <emph>I believe
                     it.</emph> Your pure woman's instincts also force you to believe it all."</p>
               <p>"To what conclusion does that remark tend?"</p>
               <p>"That, not only do I need you to perfect my nature and my life, but you <emph>need
                     me</emph> in your life-discipline. You are strong, that I know, but stronger in
                  your emotional than your intellectual nature. 'What man loves in woman is her
                  affection, not her intellect.' You are strong, and strong souls find a deep life
                  in the solitude of lofty thought; but the tempter will come to you in solitude; he
                  came to the Man-God in the wilderness; he will turn that strong emotional nature
                  of yours to a wild work of havoc; and woman as you are, you cannot fly into
                  world-action for refuge and forgetfulness, as men do. You must stay alone in the
                  desert of your heart, with your tempter. There are those who stay for years in
                  those deserts, never tasting the sublime bliss and agony of love; if they conquer
                  the tempter, angels come and minister to them, and they hold high
                  companionship—they find communion with the infinite, the Eternal!"</p>
               <p>"But the tempter may drive men to madness."</p>
               <p>"Yes, Magdalene Barclay, and if you dare trust yourself in the world wilderness
                  alone, you will tempt demons around you; you need not hope that a providence will
                  work miracles to save you, if you tempt him by such rashness. The world is no
                  place for a <emph>woman alone;</emph> if you knew it as I know it, you would not
                  blame me for saying I would be tempted to put a dagger into your heart rather than
                  trust your innocence and ignorance unprotected to its mercy! <emph>Alone,</emph> a
                  legion of tempters will be upon your path, like sleuth hounds; your grace, your
                  beauty, your fascination, more bewitching from the intellectual charm around it,
                  and especially your orphanage and desolation, will invite devils in the form of
                  men to tempt you beyond refuge; and then a thousand agonies will cry out from
                  within you, a thousand devils will batter at your heart calling out for me and the
                     <emph>lost love</emph> I once gave you!"</p>
               <p>Mag shuddered from head to foot.</p>
               <p>"You are drawing a horrible picture of the world!"</p>
               <p>"It is not overdrawn. Would to God it were! I <emph>know</emph> the world,
                  Magdalene, as a woman can never know it till she has lost her womanliness. Let me
                     <emph>save</emph> you with my love—you cannot afford to lose it!"</p>
               <pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6426-00000119"/>
               <p>Heaven and earth seemed to be reeling beneath Mag's feet.</p>
               <p>"Must I ever lose it, Charlie?"</p>
               <p>"You must take it on my terms—they are true and honorable."</p>
               <p>"Charlie," said Mag, after a pause, "you must leave me here now; if ever I am rich
                  in friends and fortune, I promise to come to you of my own <emph>free will,</emph>
                  and give myself to you 'lavishly, carelessly, utterly.'"</p>
               <p>"I want you as you are, my darling!"</p>
               <p>For a long, long time there was silence between the two young hearts.</p>
               <p>"Will you give yourself to me, Magdalene?"</p>
               <p>"I cannot—I cannot—I cannot! Some spirit, whose mandate I cannot disobey,
                     <emph>forbids</emph> me to accept your <emph>compassion!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Compassion!" There was intense bitterness in the tone. "You are, indeed, a
                  perfect skeptic. You do indeed doubt man and God. Yet in your heart of hearts you
                  are a firm <emph>believer.</emph> You are listening to the tempter now. It is your
                     <emph>evil</emph> angel who commands."</p>
               <p>"And you are my good angel, that I know, Charlie. You are even now becoming my
                  redeemer—you have given me strength, you have purified me! May God bless you for
                  it, if, indeed, there is a God. I could almost believe it, since <emph>you
                     exist!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Let me shield you from all temptation then! Look at the desolation of your soul
                  without me—look at my desolation without you; you will be my worst tempter if you
                  bid me leave you. God knows I love you! For you I could persecute heaven with
                  prayers so earnest and fervent that they could not be resisted!"</p>
               <p>"You will pray for me, Charlie. If you see me walking the path of misery down to
                  its bitter end, you will pray for me? You will not desert me entirely when you
                  leave me? You will not <emph>forget</emph> me, Cousin Charlie?"</p>
               <p>"If you reject me now, Mag, I shall make no promises to shield you. I shall say
                  you are an unreasonable coquette. I am true and noble now. I offer you the best
                  part of my nature. If you persist in your present course you will turn temptress
                  to me, and then I may turn tempter to you."</p>
               <p>There was a passionate, almost fierce energy in his words and glance that brought
                  back Mag's senses; but it brought out a free <emph>daring</emph> spirit. Mag never
                  knew <emph>fear</emph>—better for her if she had known it; danger had a charm for
                  her; a daring spirit in all her after life came at her call in any emergency,
                  making her calm, self-possessed, even buoyant in danger; it roused her energies to
                  action—and action is life—the spirit seemed to court danger—to bound forward, to
                  meet and brave it. There was danger in her position then, for through her
                  perversity Charles Moore was losing, with his patience, all control of his
                  powerful passions. She would not be conquered then. She looked up into his face
                  with an arch, bright smile; nay, unclasped the corded nerves of his fingers, and
                  caressed them with her own.</p>
               <p>"Charlie, I love you—you know I love you. When you go to Alabama you shall be my
                     <emph>cousin.</emph> I will love you better than all the earth beside. More
                  than this I shall not promise you. You shall write to me if you will, and do me
                  the good I need. Should you degrade the noble in you, the sin will be yours, not
                  mine—if ever I yield to temptation the sin will be mine, not yours. We shall not
                  be tempted above what we are able—if we fall we must take the consequences. I give
                  you warning, I shall not be responsible for any sins of yours. If there is a God
                  he never made me responsible for any sins but my own with you."</p>
               <p>"Well, good bye, little siren! I leave in the morning, and cannot see you
                  again—never again on earth. And if I should chance to take the road to
                  destruction, instead of the one to the better land where you are going, that love
                  of yours, and the marriage in the hereafter, will be only a foolish day
                  dream."</p>
               <p>"I shall follow you to ruin, Charlie, if you persist in going."</p>
               <p>"Then I shall certainly start. If the way to destruction is the way to win you, I
                  shall walk in it!"</p>
               <p>"Then you will promise not to forget me?"</p>
               <p>"I will remember that among the hills of New England is a beautiful, perverse
                  coquette, too proud to accept happiness from one who would give his life for her.
                  She makes an idol of her pride—and God will not suffer idols. When her pride is
                  crushed, her heart may be broken—it will be her own fault. Good bye, little,
                  selfish Mag—determined to ruin <emph>another</emph> heart with your own. But, good
                  bye!"</p>

               <p>FRANK walked in upon Mag the day after Charlie's departure, looking sulky as a
                  bear. He was in all sorts of humor.</p>
               <p>"What is it, Frank?" asked Mag.</p>
               <p>"I'm cross! I'm mad as thunder! I wish all creation was one everlasting rag! I'd
                  strip it into inch pieces, make it into whip-cords, and whip some of the nonsense
                  out of you!"</p>
               <p>"You don't say so! A young fellow from college, too! You wouldn't, Frank! You
                     <emph>know</emph> you wouldn't!"</p>
               <p>"I wish this little sneaking earth was a foot-ball, I'd kick it—or burst—till it
                  collapsed and let off the <emph>gas!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Sure enough, Frank!"</p>
               <p>"I wish all creation was <emph>one</emph> insignificant puppy—instead of a
                  combination of puppies—I'd worry it till it would bark with a vim, instead of
                  whining and snarling!"</p>
               <p>"And so—o—o!" said Mag, with a whimper.</p>
               <p>"If the universe was one big <emph>feline</emph> cat, I would pull its tail till
                  it squalled worse than bedlam! I'm venomous!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Don't</emph> do it, Frank!" Mag put her finger in a corner of her eye.</p>
               <p>"<emph>For your sake, Mag, I won't!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Thank you!"</p>
               <p>"Mag, for a cousin of mine, you <emph>mean</emph> to be a right, clever, little
                  somebody, but you've missed it <emph>certain!</emph> I love you worse than forty
                  dogs, but you are a <emph>fool!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"You don't say so, Frank!"</p>
               <p>"And I'd work for you worse than forty mules!"</p>
               <p>"Mercy on us!"</p>
               <p>"But you've been, and gone, and <emph>done</emph> it!"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"With malice prepense, without cause or provocation, committed murder and suicide
                  in the first degree, besides general ruination to the family on all sides. Charlie
                  told me that you had 'kicked' him, 'sacked' him. Yankicé, you have 'mittened' him,
                  sent him marching—for forever and a day!"</p>
               <p>"I declare, I never!"</p>
               <p>"You've done it, sure as shooting! Do you take him for such a spooney as to be
                  fooled by your whims? You have mistaken your man, certain. If you calculate on
                  doing it you are calculating without your host. There is plenty of
                     <emph>iron</emph> in Charlie Moore, and you have come to it now. You are
                  playing a losing game. You'll 'see the stars' before you ever see him again."</p>
               <p>"I have seen them frequently, and was not frightened."</p>
               <p>"You'll see them in the daytime, soon."</p>
               <p>"Sufficient unto the day is the darkness and the shining thereof."</p>
               <p>"And what destiny do you propose for yourself now?"</p>
               <p>"I am to be promoted to the dignity of school ma'am, in about two weeks, you know,
                  in which sphere I shall, no doubt, work out my appointed destiny."</p>
               <p>"You are ambitious!"</p>
               <p>"I shall do with my <emph>might</emph> all that my hands, heart and head find to
                  do. I shall do my <emph>best</emph> in everything."</p>
               <p>"I think you have tried yourself, for a week or so."</p>
               <p>"Angels can do no better than their best—are responsible for no more."</p>
               <p>"Work out your own destruction, Mag!"</p>
               <p>"Or salvation?"</p>
               <p>"It will be a draw-game, at your <emph>best.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"No <emph>chance</emph> about it; I intend to <emph>win.</emph> When do you start
                  for the lakes and life?"</p>
               <p>"In just a month; and I intend to see life too! Don't know what Prex Woolsey will
                  say. I shall have to fix up a great excuse for the Faculty; father will help me
                  out, though. He believes in the expansion of body as well as mind, being a
                  physician of bodies instead of souls. He thinks a boy ought to <emph>grow.</emph>
                  Senior year is half play, anyhow. But oh, Mag, Mag, Mag, I could have forgiven you
                  anything but this. The <emph>way</emph> I love Charlie!"</p>
               <p>And she thought of it with a sort of sinking at the heart, after Frank left her.
                  Charlie had gone—gone—gone—and it was now beyond her power to recall him. Was he
                  in earnest when he told her she would never see him again on earth? He had not
                  faculties for absorbing sunshine, but some glorious light seemed to have departed
                  from her<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6426-00000121"/> world. Last week that world
                  had been radiant with rainbows; it had been full of glorious beauty—was it his
                  presence that had tinted earth and sky for her? Their loveliness had certainly
                  departed. He was not her strength, but some strange energy was dying in her heart;
                  a dull, hopeless feeling was paralyzing her; the faces around her looked like
                  those from the City of the Demons, of whom she had read, "the faces of men pained
                  within." Only yesterday, and Nature had worn bridal garments; only yesterday, and
                  every heart seemed "wrapped in Elysium." Now the very winds seemed soughing with
                  languor, sobbing to the leaves with whom yesterday they had coquetted in their
                  ecstasies, when the leaves had fluttered back their soft, laughing joy. A light
                  had gone out in Mag's heart. She wandered miles and miles away, to forget in the
                  racing of her blood that she was growing desperately soul-weary. She racked heart
                  and brain to find stimulus for action—it would never do to let her empty heart,
                  like the empty mill-stone, grind itself away.</p>
               <p>One pleasant autumn morning, she found herself ordained in the pedagogue's chair,
                  at Academia, the successor of Socrates and those other Ichabods whose glory had
                  departed. More than this, to aid her in supporting her dignity in the trying
                  emergency, Min and May had become her pupils. They gave her the new title of "Miss
                  Barclay," with becoming decorum, reverence and gravity, and she aided them up the
                  hill of science with wonderful expedition <emph>considering the
                     circumstances,</emph> which were a little alarming, Min being "engaged" to the
                  profession of the law, also being devoted to the frequent study of new law
                  documents that arrived by every post, and the answering of which required much
                  consideration.</p>
               <p>She had one pupil who was so unmanageable, that she was forced to expel him, but
                  the more he was expelled, the more he would not leave. Her dog Sport insisted upon
                  taking a graduating course; he had a cunning trick of opening the door himself and
                  walking into school, making all manner of affectionate pleadings to her for
                  pardon, at all manner of unseasonable times, especially at devotions, for Mag had
                  astonished all Glenlyn, and especially Mr. Brown, by conducting devotions in
                  school herself; so, to relieve her, at last Min and May claimed Sport as their
                  pupil, and took the responsibility of teaching him grace in manners and morals, as
                  well as the arts of conversation and literature. Under May's tuition he commenced
                  the study of English and German, together, in Woodbury's and Sander's English and
                  German Primer. Min criticised his course, insisting that he made far more rapid
                  progress in Deutsch conversation than in English. May informed her that "the
                  pictures in the primer showed vast investigating energies and wonderful research
                  into the adapting powers of the human mind, in those distinguished authors. The
                  "pictures" were intended as short "cuts" to knowledge, yet they were calculated to
                  confuse the intellect of a little fellow like Sport, who was learning the two
                  languages at one and the same time; therefore, when she became literary, she
                  intended to suggest to Messrs. Woodbury and Sanders the propriety of publishing
                  the next edition of their wonderful Primer <emph>without "pictures;</emph>" their
                  meaning was too funny for thorough improvement—at least, her pupil caused her to
                  Sport with the "ideas" continually.</p>
               <p>Mag's school became popular; the academy flourished.</p>
               <p>"Your pupil Sport, is bound to disgrace his teachers," said Frank to the three, as
                  they were walking home late, one afternoon.</p>
               <p>"We consider that a villainous slander," May Burton replied; "Sport's morals and
                  manners are admirable, the result of high cultivation, deep study of letters,
                  besides his daily association with highly gifted minds, which last is the acme of
                  education in <emph>this</emph> world."</p>
               <p>"Or any <emph>other,</emph>" said Frank. "I admire his pursuits, now, May
                  Burton."</p>
               <p>"Ah, ah, I see! Well the best regulated minds are liable to mistake. I must
                  suggest a rectification!" And "in an instant" as Frank rehearsed it to her
                  afterward, "May was chasing Sport, who was furiously chasing a flock of 'young
                  'uns,' who were chasing Grandma Barclay's flock of ducks and geese, who were
                  laboring under the mistaken impression, that it was to be their happy destiny to
                  roost in a Garden of Paradise during life—a common mistake of unfeathered ducks
                  and geese—also some pigs, of which, in the course of events, they got safely
                  dispossessed."</p>
               <p>Frank, Min and Mag, watched May and the picture with interest.</p>
               <p>"An invaluable <emph>moral</emph> can be discovered by the
                     <emph>clear-eyed,</emph>" said Frank, pointing to little Harry Fenn, who
                  brought up the pursuit in the rear, with a long, hopelessly lazy trot after a
                  turkey-gobbler. "<emph>Pursuing</emph> an object in<pb n="242-243"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000122"/> life from a <emph>sense of duty,</emph> without the
                  remotest expectation of overtaking it! <emph>Faith</emph> is the ingredient
                  wanting for success. <emph>Faith</emph> would inspire energy, and Harry could
                  captivate that gobbler!"</p>
               <p>When all the young 'uns, ducks, geese and turkeys, had trotted out of sight, and
                  grandma had smoothed her ruffled feathers, May and Sport returned refreshed and
                  happy.</p>
               <p>Frank strolled into the schoolroom the next morning, to fulfill the duties of
                  examining committee. "It was a matter of conscience with him," he said, "to see
                  that the teacher did not impose upon the public."</p>
               <p>The school had resolved itself into a committee of the whole, with Mag as
                     <emph>chairman</emph> (!) and Min and May leaders, in a discussion of the story
                  of Joseph and his brethren. Mag was painting in word pictures, the boy-dreamer,
                  with his inspired Hebrew eyes, his wild grief when torn from home, and his
                  father's love, and that serpent sting in his anguish, his brothers' hatred. She
                  painted his life in slavery, the sobbing of his great agony of longing, his dreams
                  of home, and the beautiful little baby-brother who had slept there in his arms.
                  She told how his sorrow and solitude had ripened into strength at last, how fierce
                  temptation and fiery wrong had developed in him a wisdom beyond that of the
                  serpent, because, amid all, he had preserved his soul <emph>pure.</emph> She told
                  them how he had wondered by day and by night, why, <emph>why,</emph> WHY <emph>God
                     had blighted his youth, why</emph> God poured upon him such degradation, made
                  him worse than orphaned, a stranger and a <emph>slave.</emph>
                  <emph>What</emph> was God doing with him? for God <emph>was</emph> with him. She
                  told, too, how <emph>love</emph> was given even him at last; he became a prince
                  instead of a slave, and then his brothers who had <emph>hated</emph> him, came to
                  him as suppliants. She described how he forgave them for blasting his youth, his
                  youth that <emph>never could return</emph> to him, and loved them with his olden,
                  deep, yearning, boyhood's love. She described the storm that was convulsing his
                  soul, beneath the calm words that asked, "Is your <emph>father</emph> well, the
                     <emph>old man</emph> of whom you spake?" and his fervent blessing over his
                  beautiful boy brother; "God be gracious to thee, my son!" And when nature had
                  endured to the utmost, how he made haste to reach his chamber, that the tempest
                  might weep itself away. And again, when his agony of love mastered him at last, he
                  drove out his attendants, and threw himself into his brothers' arms, sobbing, "I
                  am Joseph. Doth my father yet live? Be not grieved or angry with yourselves, for
                     <emph>God</emph> sent me hither to save your lives by a great deliverance. It
                  was not <emph>you</emph> that sent me hither, but <emph>God.</emph>" Mag painted
                  the patriarch, too, refusing to be comforted for his lost idol, the son of Rachel,
                  whose loveliness had won such wild worship of his youth—his rending his garments,
                  his clothing himself in sackcloth, and sitting in dust, saying, "I will go down
                  into my grave mourning." Mag went on: "And when years and years had passed, when
                  famine and sorrow had done their work, when he, too, had wondered, as all men do
                  wonder, <emph>what God was doing with him,</emph> and when the end would be, his
                  sons came and told him, that Joseph was yet alive, and prince and governor over
                  all Egypt. 'His heart fainted, and he believed them not.' Joseph came up from the
                     <emph>dead,</emph> as a prince to gladden his father's aged eyes! But at last
                  the spirit of Jacob revived from the shock of intense joy, and he was
                     <emph>satisfied.</emph> Was ever mortal before <emph>satisfied</emph> with
                  blessing? 'It <emph>is enough</emph>—it is <emph>enough,</emph> Joseph, my son, is
                  yet alive. I will go and see him before I die.' When he had clasped Rachel's
                  first-born in his arms, when he had wept on Joseph's neck, life had full fruition,
                  the harvest was gathered. 'Now <emph>let me die,</emph> since I have seen thy
                  face, my son!'</p>
               <p>"Oh, what love God had planted in human hearts! God had done it all. God was in
                  all history. God permitted the earth to be enriched by the tears of men, and the
                  blood of nations, that from such lavished treasures a better harvest of men and
                  nations might arise. God was in all history. God with us. Never for one moment had
                  he forsaken his children of earth—'the very hairs of their head were all
                  numbered—not a sparrow fell to the ground without him.'"</p>
               <p>"Do you really <emph>believe</emph> all that?" asked Frank of Mag, when they were
                  alone after school.</p>
               <p>"I <emph>try</emph> to believe it, Frank, because there is nothing else to believe
                  on earth. Disbelief of all things, is uncomfortable, you know. I preach mostly to
                     <emph>convince myself;</emph> as they say Pascal wrote his 'Evidences of
                  Christianity.'"</p>
               <p>"Exactly."</p>
               <p>"I am working on a <emph>forlorn hope,</emph> you understand. Life is a failure,
                  anyway, <emph>unless this saves it.</emph> Neither harm nor <emph>risk</emph> in
                  trying it. Impossible to lose by it."</p>
               <pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6426-00000123"/>
               <p>"All the village are in convulsions of astonishment at your course."</p>
               <p>"It will do them good. They need something to talk about, and they might find
                  worse gossip."</p>
               <p>"Well, well. You are more than half right; you may <emph>win</emph> something, and
                  you can't <emph>lose.</emph> You've headed Mr. Brown on skepticism."</p>
               <p>"But I have a careful game to play with him; he wants me to join the church. He
                  flatters my pious efforts, says the church are much pleased with my
                     <emph>devotion</emph> in school. I'm obliged for their good opinion."</p>
               <p>"Of course."</p>
               <p>"I told him, simply, that I was not prepared to join the church—gave him no
                  reason, he not being trustworthy—he must not have it in his power again to injure
                  me, by calling me a skeptic. A female skeptic is a monster in the eyes of the
                  world, fit only for perdition."</p>
               <p>"Why not do it to improve your business?"</p>
               <p>"I happen to have a <emph>conscience</emph> that forbids."</p>
               <p>"Your conscience has always been a troublesome article, it makes you argue in a
                  circle."</p>
               <p>"Well, I will not join the church, because I do not choose to put myself into
                  fellowship with vanity, alias Mr. Brown—with senseless bigotry, alias Deacon
                  Kimball—or self-righteousness, alias Deacon Carter—those men who allowed Father
                  Parker's dishonor."</p>
               <p>"Judge not!—judge not!"</p>
               <p>"I am not yet prepared to take a false oath on the <emph>creed.</emph> 'I
                     <emph>believe in God the Father,</emph> etc.' I do not know whether I believe
                  or not; my belief itself remains to be demonstrated."</p>
               <p>"You are like Thomas, who would not believe, till he had seen the wounds with his
                  own eyes, and put his fingers in the prints of the nails."</p>
               <p>"One thing I <emph>fully believe;</emph> I must <emph>work</emph> out my own
                  salvation."</p>
               <p>"There is common sense in that creed. That is mine."</p>
               <p>"Work it out with <emph>fear and trembling.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"I may disagree with you there. Fear and trembling are not useful commodities
                     '<emph>in a world like this.</emph>' (What a sneer Longfellow put into those
                  words: 'Fear not <emph>in a world like this.</emph>') Much might be said on both
                  sides; my motto is, 'Possunt quia posse <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >videntur,</foreign>' or as James Martineau turns it, 'Qui possunt, posse
                     <foreign xml:lang="LAT">videntur;</foreign>"</p>
               <p>"Change the creed to this, Frank, '<emph>Faith</emph> without <emph>works</emph>
                  is dead.' If you <emph>cannot</emph> get the <emph>faith,</emph> make sure of the
                     <emph>works. 'Do God's will,</emph> and you shall <emph>know</emph> of the
                  doctrine,' unless the Bible is a lie."</p>
               <p>"Go ahead, Mag, you'll work out something! No doubt about that! Whether it is your
                  salvation or destruction, <emph>Time</emph> will tell."</p>
               <p>"Or Eternity, if there is one."</p>
               <p>"I wish I had more admiration for the <emph>work</emph> you have done, on
                  Charlie's account. If that is a specimen, I think the result doubtful."</p>
               <p>"I intend to be a model of meekness and humility."</p>
               <p>"Well, 'vivamus dum vivimus.' We fellows are off for the lakes in western New
                  York, next week, hunting!"</p>
               <p>May Burton interrupted them—she came and addressed Mag in her own demure, quaint
                  style:</p>
               <p>"Miss Barclay, my parents and guardians being about to retire from home on a visit
                  for a week, <emph>petition</emph> that you will favor them by becoming the 'united
                  head of their family,' during their absence. 'Yours very respectfully,' being
                  installed housekeeper <foreign xml:lang="LAT">pro tem.</foreign>"</p>
               <p>"Of what numerical magnitudes are the dimensions of the family, with the 'united
                  head?'" asked Frank, in her style.</p>
               <p>"The 'united head' counts <emph>one;</emph> sis counts <emph>two.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Sis counts <emph>two?</emph> She is a multiplied quantity!"</p>
               <p>"The least common multiple! Please go, Miss Barclay; I want you so much."</p>
               <p>"The 'united head' will not be <emph>divided</emph> in sentiment," said Mag,
                  trying to improve the nonsense in the English language. "I'll go, if Aunt Lina
                  permits."</p>
               <p>"And will be constituted the greatest common divisor of all the
                     <emph>responsibilities</emph> of the household," continued Frank.</p>
               <p>"Association <emph>is</emph> education!" said Mag.</p>
               <p>"Witness Sport's wonderful progress," added May.</p>
               <p>"How astonishingly school associations and intercourse with mathematical ladies do
                  brighten Frank's mathematical ideas and manners!"</p>
               <p>The "united head" with its "associated ideas" walked homeward, with their books,
                  to the "bosom of the family."</p>
               <p>Housekeeping and school duties went on in Utopian fashion that week. May set the
                  table for tea, also set "sis" to gather bouquets for the table, while the sun set
                  in the<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6426-00000124"/> west. Mag was particularly fond
                  of the "good," and gratified her taste by gathering ripe, yellow peaches from the
                  garden, removing their blooming complexions, and laying the melting pulps, frosted
                  with sugar and cream, into dishes, while the biscuits were ripening in the oven,
                  and the tea-kettle getting up opposition music to the canaries. And when the
                  "goodies" had gone the way they ought always to go, the cloth was removed, and
                  Mag's dignity also, or rather postponed into the family rocking-chair; and the
                  school studies, especially Latin, progressed in a zigzag sort of fashion,
                  thus:</p>
               <p>May seated on a footstool, reclining her arm upon the teacher's lap; her eyes on
                  Cicero—reading.</p>
               <p>"'Nemo femina magna sine aliquo afflatu divino unquam fuit,' which being
                     <emph>freely</emph> translated reads: 'No magnificent woman was ever without
                  some divine inspiration;' the true meaning of which proposition is somewhat
                  ambiguous—the interpretation depending upon the accented word. If <foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">unquam</foreign> is emphatic, the meaning is obvious, 'Great
                  ladies who are divinities remain <emph>forever</emph> divine.'"</p>
               <p>"The meaning is clear to those who appreciate the sublimity of absurd things."</p>
               <p>May went on with the lesson.</p>
               <p>"Undoubtedly that was Cicero's thought, for if <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >aliquo</foreign> receives the accent, a portion of the eloquence as well as
                  truth is lost; thus, 'A great woman has <emph>somewhat</emph> of the divine in her
                  nature,' with a very perceptible sneer in the emphatic 'somewhat'—'not much.'"</p>
               <p>"Ergo, magna pars veri latet," quoted Mag; "though your exposition of the
                  paragraph is luminous—even brilliant."</p>
               <p>"Yes," commented May, gravely, "truth <emph>has</emph> a bad habit of hiding
                  itself; but one reason is obvious—its proportions are so gigantic that small and
                  weak minds are obliged to separate it into infinitesimal doses for digestion! and
                  unfortunately the overwhelming majority of humanity are possessed of only that
                  style of mind."</p>
               <p>"Quoniam difficile est Yankicé et proprie communia dicere," quoted Mag again.</p>
               <p>"Because it is especially difficult, in the Yankee tongue, to make
                     <emph>common</emph> truths <emph>proper</emph> ones—the grammar of the language
                  forbidding truth to be at the same time <emph>common</emph> and
                     <emph>proper</emph>—fitted for the masses and also for the 'aristos.'"</p>
               <p>"Nothing so sweet as nonsense, which never aims at truth, little May— <q>

                     "<emph>Miss Barclay,</emph> I intended to have said—excuse my shock of
                  forgetfulness! Was that original—mistakes and all? or was it from Lieutenant

               <p>But just here their studies were interrupted by the entrance of Frank and Min,
                  with a brace of pigeons and a gun. They had divided the spoil, but presented it,

               <p>"But, Frank," said Min, "what on earth <emph>can</emph> they do with the things?

               <p>"It is entirely a matter of <emph>taste,</emph> Min. If you are fond of feathers,

               <p>"I can <emph>undress</emph> them, if that will answer your purposes," said Frank.
                  "Will you prefer the feathers taken off or arranged on?"</p>
               <p>"We <emph>do</emph> usually unfeather pigeons for pies," said May. "If you desire
                  it, however, we can make one for you, Frank, seasoned with plumes."</p>
               <p>"I won't put you to that trouble <emph>now,</emph> May—wait a few years."</p>
               <p>"We will make a division of labor," said Min; "Frank and I will dissect the birds,
                  if Mag and May will make the pies."</p>
               <p>"A precious phenomenon <emph>you</emph> will make anatomizing those birds!"
                  exclaimed Frank, taking out a pocket spyglass and walking around Min to take a
                     <emph>view.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Min had dressed herself for church on the coming Sabbath. The dress was of silk,
                  of the most gorgeous purple tints, made with a double skirt, and bright scarlet
                  trimmings; over the dress was fastened a school apron of white Swiss muslin, very
                  full, and knotted on either side with<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC6426-00000125"/>
                  heavy scarlet ribbons. The colors harmonized with the exquisite bloom of her
                  complexion, and the black, dancing eyes. Her hair was thrown back from the
                  prominent brow in coquettish curls.</p>
               <p>Frank commenced taking notes, as he surveyed her.</p>
               <p>"Hat of the size of a fragment of a pocket-handkerchief, and it will need a
                  telescope of the highest magnifying powers, in the voyage of a traveller
                  circumambulating that immense <emph>globe</emph>—(Query, <emph>cone?</emph>
                  Reply—Doubted the existence of an <emph>apex</emph>) to discover that part of the
                  territory where the hat is worn or concealed."</p>
               <p>"I shall be ready to dissect those subjects in half an instant," said Min,
                  flitting off to change her dress, while Frank commenced stripping the bipeds with
                  alarming energy; he tore the feathers off in clouds, while Mag and May
                  superintended.</p>
               <p>"Imagine Adam dissecting pigeons for his spouse." said Frank.</p>
               <p>"Imagine Eve in a <emph>stew</emph> of a pie with them," said Mag.</p>
               <p>Frank looked up to see Min metamorphosed; she having donned a pretty calico
                  morning dress for the pigeon-work.</p>
               <p>"Never try to fancy Madam Eve taking off her 'store clothes,' to dress birds;
                  'cause why, she didn't wear 'em, being '<emph>nature unadorned.</emph>'"</p>
               <p>"And," said Mag, "what a stupid time Adam and Eve had, sitting down to dinner
                  every day, with only the 'united head' and no family."</p>
               <p>"And using one rock for a chair, and another rock for a table," added Min, "and
                  eating stew-pie with their <emph>fingers.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Min, what did they do with their <emph>teeth?</emph>" asked Frank.</p>
               <p>"And the pies made without <emph>flour,</emph>" said Min.</p>
               <p>"With peaches and cream for dessert," Mag added.</p>
               <p>"And strawberries and pineapples, <emph>dry</emph> so. Adam and Eve were
                  unfortunately minus the dishes to raise the cream; and it wouldn't pay to turn
                  milk-maids. I'd have been too lazy to have chased the cows if I'd been Adam, and
                  Eve had no dairy to make butter and things. But May, you look as if the
                  conversation was getting too strong for your <emph>principles;</emph> mine may be
                  a little awry; you must straighten them for me..... What do you suppose Adam and
                  his lady love found to talk about, <emph>alone</emph> there in Eden, week in and
                  week out? They had no little boy and girl scrapes to be funny over; and
                  love-making, after an hour or so, is the most insipid business in creation. I
                     <emph>know,</emph> for I've tried it..... Never met two ladies in my
                  life—present company always excepted—who did not <emph>exhaust</emph> themselves
                  in less than two days..... And Eve, you know, wasn't <emph>cultivated</emph> or
                  accomplished; she never played the piano, poor woman, because Adam, poor man,
                  couldn't invent one for her..... She hadn't <emph>read up</emph> on the poets.
                  Unfortunately for Eve, Massey, the Brownings, and Longfellow, and all that fry,
                  hadn't <emph>writ books,</emph> and Eve couldn't read if they had!.... How much
                  Adam and Eve did miss in not having waited till these days to be born! Pity it
                  hadn't occurred to them to do so! Our advantages are so much superior! What a
                  fortunate thing for us that she ate that apple! If she hadn't done it the modern
                  improvements would have been where the world was before it was created!..... And
                  the sublime <emph>thought,</emph> born of sin, and its progeny, sorrow, woe, and
                  anguish, would never have taught us that though we have deeper knowledge of misery
                  than the <emph>innocents</emph> of Eden, we have also a far deeper experience of
                  bliss!"</p>
               <p>"Go on, Frank; don't forget your pigeons in your philosophy."</p>
               <p>"On the whole, it is my private opinion, expressed here before this enlightened
                  audience, that we are capable of a much deeper and more exalted happiness than
                  Adam and Eve ever dreamed of in Eden before they ate the apple.... And ergo, I
                  would rather be myself, Frank Ross, <emph>as I am,</emph> and risk the chances of
                  the hereafter, than have been my own first ancestors..... Also, I believe Adam
                  loved Eve a hundred fold more in the sorrow that came upon them after he
                     <emph>fell,</emph> than before he stumbled on the idea; and she returned his
                  devotion with a hundred-and-fifty fold more fervor!... To sum up the argument, I
                  think their <emph>wrong</emph> was a very <emph>right</emph> thing, <emph>taking
                     all things into consideration,</emph> and, especially, as the Bible says that
                  God <emph>predestinated</emph> the fall from before the foundation of the
                  earth!"</p>
               <p>"You must be sure to come and dine with us to-morrow, Frank," said May Burton; "we
                  shall want your <emph>taste</emph> on our pie."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, May Burton; my heart will be with you, wherever my bodily presence may
                  be."</p>
               <p>The pie progressed toward its destiny the next day, Saturday, in a manner
                  characteristic of its creators. May invented yeast for the crust, and the three
                  together deposited<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6426-00000126"/> sited the entire
                     <emph>stew</emph> into a mammoth pot, their appetites being expansive as well
                  as their imaginations, and the pottage was placed over the stove to germinate.</p>
               <p>Just as this was accomplished, the autumn woods and streams, the sunshine and the
                  breezes, called to them with all manner of enticing voices, to come out and
                  commune with Mother Nature. So they left the pie and the fire beneath it in charge
                  of "Sis," selfish souls, put on their sunbonnets, and went out to answer the call.
                  They visited the homes of the waters, garlanded themselves with crimson, green and
                  golden autumn leaves, and scarlet berries, talked of midnight and morning, of
                  moonshine and music, of death and life, and duty and devotion.</p>
               <p>"The hero-soul should go home from the march and battle of life at sunset," said
                  Mag, "under waving clouds of crimson banners, and a sky flushed golden for
                  victory."</p>
               <p>"The remark bears a decidedly <emph>military</emph> character," said May; "you
                  have been taking lessons from the <emph>army</emph> of late."</p>
               <p>They bethought themselves of the post-office at last, and journeyed thitherward,
                  but met Frank with the "documents."</p>
               <p>Min's letter consisted of some dozen enormous pages, closely written. Curious, how
                  people in love do pour out ideas."</p>
               <p>"It looks ominous to see <emph>love-letters</emph> written on
                     <emph>foolscap,</emph>" said May.</p>
               <p>Min was engaged in the abstract study of law.</p>
               <p>"They will lay aside the foolscap when they reach the sober realities," said
                  Frank. But Min was oblivious.</p>
               <p>Having at length reached the "Yours devotedly, R. Hudson Ely," on the twelfth
                  page, Min looked up with an expression of ineffable resignation. "How do you find
                  yourself, Min?" asked Mag.</p>
               <p>"She is quite miserable, she thanks you," said Frank; "suffering under an attack
                  of rheumatism on the brain, which, coming in contact with all the other
                     <emph>isms,</emph> has produced a shock to the vital system extending to the
                  regions of the heart; even a shower-bath could not cool her off, she is so
                  hot-headed and oblivious. Cupping would not relieve her, on account of the
                  abstract <emph>law</emph> lately gone into operation in her heart, which will
                  counteract the general law of the system. It is an aggravated case, to be remedied
                  only by the order of heaven's first <emph>law to woman</emph>—matrimony in a
                  tremendous dose!"</p>
               <p>"That wasn't quite as funny as I expected, Frank, though it was <emph>funny
                     some,</emph>" Min answered; "I am trying to blush with all my might."</p>
               <p>"Min," said Frank, "please loan me that love-letter. I've a use for it. I want it
                  for a <emph>pattern</emph> love-letter. I must write one <emph>soon.</emph> Is the
                     <emph>question</emph> put in business fashion?"</p>
               <p>"Very."</p>
               <p>"Does he give the items?"</p>
               <p>"Every one of them. Speaks of his industrious habits; gives the amount of every
                  dollar he ever earned in his lifetime."</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Ninety-nine dollars and some odd cents."</p>
               <p>"Pity he had not filled the figures with a round <emph>hundred!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"He was sorry about that himself. He earned that amount as a schoolmaster in the
                  Academy near his father's!"</p>
               <p>"I hope he will be forgiven for it!"</p>
               <p>"He thinks the full hundred might be made out, if he counts in what his father has
                  paid him for picking up apples at a cent a bushel; he thinks he contributed nearly
                  a hundred bushels towards making cider before he fitted for college. Having
                  succeeded in earning so much toward a competency, he feels encouraged to think he
                  may earn more."</p>
               <p>"Is the letter affectionate? Must I do so too?"</p>
               <p>"Very affectionate. If ever he earns a fortune he proposes to <emph>divide with
                     me;</emph> more than this, he says he will give me the <emph>biggest
                     half</emph>—though I am in consternation about that—it is outside of my
                  arithmetic, which says the two halves of a thing are exactly of the same size. But
                  I think we shall be able to make that right. He promises to divide with me
                     <emph>in that way,</emph> if we come to the last crust of bread, and the last
                  blanket!"</p>
               <p>"It is a magnanimous offer!"</p>
               <p>"I think so, and I intend to answer his letter immediately, and tell him that
                     <emph>I'll do it!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"When I copy that letter, May, will you imitate Min's praiseworthy example?"</p>
               <p>"My correspondence, if ever I open one, will not be an <emph>imitation.</emph> If
                  the fates will spice tart replies for me I shall try to make them
                     <emph>original.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Heigho!" exclaimed Frank. "I am ennuied! I wish I could originate a foolish or
                  silly remark for variety! I am afraid it will be utterly impossible, however,
                  having lived so long without ever having accomplished the feat!"</p>
               <pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6426-00000127"/>
               <p>"Sis," who saw them coming, ran out in great tribulation to meet them.</p>
               <p>"She had watched the fire all day," she said, "and kept the pigeons boiling, and
                  they were boiled all off the bones, and the crust was so <emph>light</emph> it had
                  risen out of the pot, and she couldn't keep it in till she squeezed it in with the
                  cover, and then the cover wouldn't stay on till she fastened it on with a
                  brick!"</p>
               <p>"You are a perfect little martyr, sis," exclaimed the three in a breath, catching
                  her and half devouring her with kisses.</p>
               <p>"It was outrageously selfish in us to leave you so long," said May, with a real
                  sorrowful sting of conscience.</p>
               <p>"We must change ourselves into three fairies, to give you the three things you
                  wish for most," said Mag.</p>
               <p>"The table is ready for dinner, but it is nearly night, and I think we will call
                  it supper this time," sis responded.</p>
               <p>The pigeons were delicious even in chaos, and Frank discovered a
                     <emph>moral</emph> in the crust, being, as all declared, a young man of
                     <emph>unusual morals.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"It was the duty of all kinds of crust, in the inchoate state, to keep under cover
                  and let the pot boil. After being fitted for the duties of a higher station, it
                  was time for the <emph>under crust</emph> to emerge and take the more responsible
                  station of <emph>upper crust</emph> in society."</p>
               <p>When Frank departed that night he bade his cousins all a "good bye," for he was to
                  be off for the lakes before he could see them on Monday morning.</p>
               <p>"Good bye, Mag! good bye, Min! good bye, little May Burton! Very pleasant have you
                  all been unto me, and my love for you is <emph>wonderful,</emph> passing the love
                  of women!"</p>
               <p>And so he went away from them.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>XXI. THE BIRTHDAY.</head>
               <p>THE weeks rolled away heavily to Mag, for Frank was gone, and she received no
                  message or tidings of, or from Charles Moore. It required all her energy to rouse
                  herself from the stupor and paralysis that was settling down upon her, with the
                  hope deferred that maketh the heart sick. She was roused from that stupor by a
                  shock that vibrated along her nerves as thunder never vibrated.</p>
               <p>A "still, small voice"—a whisper—went shuddering around the village of Glenlyn
                  late in the autumn. Men gathered together in groups, and talked with horror
                  written on their faces and glowing in their eyes; village girls whispered together
                  with pale, trembling lips; and mothers—three mothers went frantic with agony—and
                  all mothers gathered to them and wept with them in their <emph>unavailing</emph>
                  tears of untold anguish.</p>
               <p>Three mothers; one was the mother of Porter Raymond—and his father wept with her;
                  one was the mother of Mark Walton—and "he was the only son of his mother and she
                  was a widow;" and one was the mother of Frank Ross. God help all mothers who are
                  sorrowing with such sorrow!</p>
               <p>The mother of Mark Walton had received a letter from a stranger near Long Lake, in
                  Western New York, saying that three young hunters had left their traps and valises
                  at his house, by the lakes, had gone out on a deer hunt of several days, near
                  Clear Pond; that their dogs had returned at last without them, and they themselves
                  had never returned. At length the neighbors had searched the forests and lakes for
                  them, but found only a cap and glove thrown upon the shore, supposed to belong to
                  the missing hunters. The neighbors had also taken the liberty of breaking open the
                  valises, in one of which was found a letter written by Mark Walton to his mother,
                  which they forwarded with the most heart-rending tidings.</p>
               <pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC6426-00000128"/>
               <p>And it was all the tidings that ever reached Glenlyn of the fate of the young, the
                  noble, the beautiful, and brave.</p>
               <p>Alec Ross and the father of Porter Raymond went out to those lakes to look for
                  their lost treasures.</p>
               <p>For miles and miles before they reached Long Lake, on the frontiers of New York,
                  they found the people expecting, and relays of horses in waiting for the friends
                  of the lost hunters. At such a calamity the great heart of humanity was stirred;
                  strangers wept for the sorrow of fathers, and mothers, and brothers; sisters
                  shuddered at the untimely fate of the young; the forests were searched again and
                  again; the lakes were dragged; all that energy, or sympathy, or love, could devise
                  was done, but never again did there come tidings of those lost ones, to the aching
                  hearts, from the unknown land whither the hunters had gone.</p>
               <p>And at last, when the last hope had of itself quivered its last agony, and the
                  horror had settled down upon human hearts, there came the throbbing of a funeral
                  bell over the valleys of Glenlyn, to tell men that hope was dead.</p>
               <p>The knell came into the mansion of the Rosses, and Alec Ross threw himself in
                  speechless anguish into the dust; the father sat with convulsed lip and brow, and
                  gave sway to the grief that was frosting his temples; and the mother sobbed in
                  frantic sorrow and woe, like Rachel, refusing to be comforted; David's cry of
                  desolation tore itself in madness from her bleeding heart; Jacob's lamentation
                  swept her soul, "'I will go down to my grave sorrowing!' 'My son, my son! Would to
                  God! <emph>Would to God,</emph> I had died for thee.'"</p>
               <p>And Mag Barclay was lying prostrate upon her chamber floor, when the tolling bell
                  stopped her heart. Not one tear had yet visited her eye. She laughed in bitter
                  mockery: "If there was a God, he was mocking her, and she could mock him back
                  again. Yet a strange echo was ringing through her soul—it was from a book—a book
                  that <emph>some</emph> men call <emph>holy</emph>—said it had been a revelation
                  from a <emph>God(!)</emph> to man." She smiled in bitter scorn and mockery, but
                  still the echo ran along her nerves. "The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high
                  places. Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain
                  upon you.... I am distressed for thee my brother Jonathan—very pleasant hast thou
                  been unto me, thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women."</p>
               <p>The days and weeks, and months rolled on; no human anguish, and no human hope
                  could stop their flight. Time speeds over the wrecks of thrones, and religions,
                  and hearts with tireless wing, bearing all hopes, and all despair to the bourne
                  whence no traveller returns. The months rolled on, and hearts became accustomed to
                  their cureless woe.</p>
               <p>The months rolled on; they brought at last, Mag Barclay's birthnight anniversary.
                  There was a covenant made years before between four young hearts: "If it be
                  possible, we will meet on the night of the second anniversary of Magdalene
                  Barclay's birthday."</p>
               <p>On that anniversary night, the heart of Frank Ross was at rest from all its daring
                  earth-dreams; the brave, restless spirit, freed from its glorious tenement of
                  clay, was wandering—where—in the universe of the Eternal? God knows where. Did
                  Frank Ross remember the covenant meeting with those he so loved on earth?</p>
               <p>On that birthnight anniversary, Ralph Burton, who had also been a rover, and a
                  dreamer of royal dreams, lay upon his pillow. Consumption was preying on his
                  vitals; he had come home at last to die; <emph>his</emph> heart also, with its
                  wealth of pure and earnest aspirations, was tolling its last faint beat upon the
                  pulses. A smile played over his pale lips, as he murmured fond words; years
                  before, he had murmured those words when a little child in his mother's arms.
                  Years had passed since he had seen that mother, but he was going to sleep now, and
                  when he waked, her arms would be around him again, and their home would be once
                  more together, beyond the grave. The soft light was fading in the blue eye, the
                  sunny clustering locks were damp with the death-dew on the temples, and the spirit
                  at last fluttered free from the flesh that had chafed, and worn, and fretted it in
                  its mortal pain.</p>
               <p>Was it not <emph>possible,</emph> that the spirits of Frank Ross and Ralph Burton,
                  redeemed their covenant?</p>
               <p>The long, long night passed, and two other spirits, yet in the flesh, were bending
                  over the beautiful marble features, now smiling in their last placid slumber;
                  trembling fingers wove together fresh green leaves and pure white rosebuds, and
                  placed the wreaths upon the bosom of Ralph Burton, to wither with his earth-dreams
                  in his early grave. The young and manly, whose hearts were yet flushing high in
                  their strength and glory, bore him to the churchyard; they<pb n="256-257"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000129"/> laid him gently and lovingly down, chanted over him
                  their solemn requiem, and <emph>left him there.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>The green turf, and the summer blossoms, are now springing upon his bosom, and
                  soft winds whisper over him in his dreamless rest; but to the grave of Frank Ross,
                  neither the springing grass, nor the summer blossoms, nor the autumn breezes
                  come—but winds on the restless sea, and solemn surges, with the ocean echo of
                  eternity, are forever chanting his requiem to the hearts that loved—that
                     <emph>still</emph> love him so wildly.</p>
               <p>Among the valleys of New England, a white marble cross is rising; a symbol is
                  sculptured upon it, whose interpretation is, "Jesus Hominum Salvator."</p>
               <p>For years Magdalene Barclay was accustomed to say, that if nothing else lay
                  beneath that marble, she knew of a human heart trampled into that grave, and a
                  weight heavier than marble was dragging the heart down—down—down to a bottomless
                  abyss. When other years had rolled away, another marble scroll was placed within
                  the iron inclosure, on which was sculptured these words: "Very pleasant hast thou
                  been to me, my brother; thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of
                  woman."</p>

               <p>IT was a summer holiday; Mag was waiting for the mail. She had received one letter
                  from Charlie Moore—a lament for Frank—and now was hoping to receive another. Sweet
                  fool! Her youth and energy had repelled sorrow, and more than one blow was needed
                  to crush her strong spirit. As she waited and watched, her pulses palpitated with
                  an unsteady throb; the minutes dragged on into hours; the hours droned into ages,
                  and her heart fluttered, and stopped, and the pulses struggled, and throbbed on,
                  and when the longed-for music of the mail train reached her ear at last, her heart
                  bounded to her throat with a convulsive leap that choked her.</p>
               <p>"Down! down, insane simpleton! Have you gone mad, entirely? Do you really find
                  yourself at this stage of your existence in <emph>love,</emph> past redemption?
                  For shame, Miss Mag Barclay!" she said to herself, as she put on her sunbonnet,
                  and started across the meadow to the post-office. "Miss Barclay, I agree with
                  Uncle Alph. You are becoming to me one of Old Nick's own unaccountables! Really, I
                  supposed I had some slight accquaintance with you, but just now you are the
                     <emph>one</emph> personage on earth of whom I know precisely nothing. If some
                  benevolent soul would but make your acquaintance and give me an introduction, it
                  would be a deed of unbounded charity to you and me, both!"</p>
               <p>And Mag seated herself and Miss Barclay both, at the foot of a tree, to let Miss
                  Barclay's heart subside.</p>
               <p>"Just get through aching, if you please, and conduct yourself with the unbounded
                  sense of propriety required of a respectable female heart, at your age, and then
                  we can proceed on our way."</p>
               <p>Just then our acquaintances, Jenny Hale and Etta Fanshaw, two precious morsels of
                  humanity, came tearing toward her out of breath, with their innocent wits in a
                  perfect puzzle over the mysteries of human depravity, and the other mysteries they
                  had found on the old mysterious earth. Their eyes were full of it, their faces
                  radiated unspeakable concern over it. They were certainly in trouble again—it is
                  the fate of mortals, especially little girls. The trouble and mystery came in the
                  form of a little, half-dead, more than half-naked chicken, with a broken wing.
                  Jenny was panting with excitement, and hardly able to breathe, on account of her
                  excessive indignation.</p>
               <p>"Oh—cousin—Miss—Mag—Barclay—only—just—do
                  see—what—hateful—Harry—Fenn—has—been—doing—to—this—chicky!"</p>
               <p>"He's the wickedest boy I ever did <emph>see!</emph>" exclaimed Etta. "And where
                  do you s'pose he got his badness?"</p>
               <p>Mag didn't know; she had wondered herself.</p>
               <p>"Such a <emph>nice</emph> old hen, too!" Etta went on; "and all her chickies out
                  in the yard, so good, and Harry would throw stones at 'em, and he broke this one's
                  wings—just see!" And Etta poked her little fingers among the broken bones, till
                  the chicken set up a squall.</p>
               <p>"Careful, careful, Etta," said Jenny; "you'll hurt 'im."</p>
               <p>"And then Harry went and buried him <emph>alive,</emph> all but his head, in the
                  sand, 'cause he was 'fraid if Grandma Barclay could catch him, she'd spank him;
                  and he ought to be skinned," said Etta.</p>
               <p>"Yes," Jenny went on, "and we heard 'im peepin', and cryin', and cryin'—poor
                  chicky! see how dreadfully all his feathers look!"</p>
               <p>"And how bad the poor old hen did feel too! Such a good old hen! Why, I guess she
                  lays two or three of the biggest sort of eggs every day! She cried about it
                  awfully. Grandma thinks lots of that old hen. I don't believe she'll ever want to
                  lay another egg!"</p>
               <p>"Well," said Mag, "will you let me take care of him, while you go to the
                  post-office, and get a letter for me?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. A letter for you?"</p>
               <p>"Two of them, if you can."</p>
               <p>"We'll get a whole lot of 'em if you'll fix his wing."</p>
               <p>"And Miss Mag, we just want you to whip Harry Fenn; <emph>you can,</emph> you
                  know, 'cause you are school-ma'am," said Etta.</p>
               <pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6426-00000131"/>
               <p>Off they flew again. Mag tore a strip from her torn handkerchief, screwed the
                  broken wing into shape, and bound it up, continuing some running mental remarks to
                  Miss Barclay, meanwhile. "I just wonder what is the destination of all creation,
                  from this little ugly spider crawling up my hand—I wonder, by the by, why I hate
                  it, and why it seems ugly—to this forlorn chicken with its broken wing, and my
                  forlorner self with my broken, or crazed heart. I am not sure but I have lost
                  every atom of it. If I have one, it certainly has been trodden on, and it aches;
                  and it would do some malicious part of my nature good, to step on some one else's
                  heart, for mine is just tired of aching <emph>alone;</emph> it is becoming
                  decidedly stupid business. Dear, dear! Am I one of the vestiges of creation, or an
                  illustration of the development theory? Would I not be valuable testimony of the
                  rocks? I do feel a curious sort of sensation in my pericardium; something there is
                  undergoing a hardening process; perhaps it is only ossification, perhaps worse. On
                  the whole, I wish Frank was here. The world is audaciously stupid without him.
                  Frank helped me out of mysteries. The ministers, good souls, advise me not to
                  interfere with things beyond knowledge—it will do harm, and no good; their advice
                  comes years and years too late; the mischief was done, it seems to me, a thousand
                  years ago. I wonder if I am that old, and where the former life chanced." And then
                  a great gush of feeling, desperate, reckless feeling, came choking up. "It was
                  right shabby in Frank to desert me so! It was a miserably foolish thing in him to
                  go off and die, leaving me alone in this great—horrible!"—She went half mad in her
                  longing, as many and many another has done, and wondered why Frank, in his
                  glorious prime, must go into the unknown, when there were others longing for
                  death, even in his grimmest horrors, to whom he refused to come. If there was a
                  God—and she <emph>supposed</emph> there might be one—not <emph>knowing,</emph> she
                  would say—if there was a God, what was he doing with them all?"</p>
               <p>Etta and Jenny came back, bearing each a letter in her dainty fingers.</p>
               <p>"But you can't think! Captain Kimball was so awful stingy!" said Jenny. "We told
                  him you wanted <emph>six</emph> letters, and he wouldn't let us have but
                     <emph>two.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"But he said he guessed you wouldn't care much," added Etta, "for this one was big
                  enough for six. Ain't it a big one?"</p>
               <p>"Thank you, that will do. Here is your chicky to carry to grandma." And then Mag
                  looked up into the glorious beauty of earth and heaven, at the letter in her hand
                  from Charles Moore, and her reeling senses returned; and she sent up a fervent
                  prayer for forgiveness, to the unknown God, because she had committed
                  sacrilege—had mocked him! She thanked him with a gush of happiness, that in the
                  midst of judgment he had remembered mercy. Charles Moore was left to her still.
                  Yes, she had several idols upon earth yet. God had not taken them all, though he
                  had said he would not permit idols.</p>
               <p>Strange! She believed in God when he gave her some fair and lovely blessing; but
                  his greatest blessings come sometimes in the guise of pain—when the nature needs
                  to be cleansed from pride and purified from passion. She thanked God for her
                  letter. We can be wonderfully full of faith and piety when we are in the bliss
                  that follows relief from pain And then she read the document.</p>

                           <p>"MY DARLING COUSIN: This relationship of ours is becoming a most
                              charming and entertaining affair. I was dissatisfied with it at first.
                              As Fanny Fern so appropriately puns, I was 'Oll-of-a-Twist, asking for
                                 <emph>more.</emph>' But it is satisfying me at last, and I am
                              concluding that you were wiser than I, when you cooled my burning
                              love, my fiery passion, in that prudent fashion of yours. You were
                              wise, Mag—wise as a serpent, and harmless as a dove. The spice of
                              coquetry in you, cousin, but added to the piquancy of the
                              entertainment. A <emph>full</emph>-blown coquette is my detestation,
                              but the <emph>buds</emph> in your nature were exquisitely beautiful.
                              There was the fragrance of innocence in the atmosphere, in which
                              purity's self seemed to expand. There is magnanimity in you, strangely
                              mingled with that graceful coquetry, and you will be glad to know that
                              I have <emph>given you up</emph> at last. And now I appreciate with
                              you the beauty of our cousinship; it is so accommodating in its
                              relations; has so much expansiveness; it means <emph>so much,</emph>
                              and <emph>so little!</emph> With a cousin, thought itself is
                              fetterless—there can be so much license in thought, word and action. I
                              only regret that for a time our intercourse, even as cousins, must be
                              interrupted—as I leave soon for the Old World! Why could I not have
                              had <emph>you</emph> as a companion? As my <emph>cousin</emph> you
                              cannot go, unless you'll adopt the romantic, and go as<pb n="262-263"

                              <emph>page</emph> to Palestine—which will do to <emph>dream</emph> of
                              only, in a <emph>world like this!</emph>
                           </p>
                           <p>"Yes, it is better to remain only cousins than to be parted as
                                 <emph>engaged lovers;</emph> then we should have been under
                              restraint. I am jealous by nature—for 'love is full of jealousy,' and
                              'jealousy is <emph>cruel</emph> as the grave.' You are jealous also by
                              nature—and, Mag, I'll swear I believe <emph>we loved</emph> madly when
                              we stood upon those cliffs together, and rocked ourselves in elysium
                              on the billows of that little lake! It is all over now—we will not
                              regret it—I <emph>cannot;</emph> I shall never forget, in Paradise or
                              Hades, that I have wound my arms around you—when you fainted on my
                              bosom I drew life up from your heart, through those delicious lips,
                              that will thrill to all eternity! Eternity will not be to us what it
                              would have been, had we never met, and loved, and parted.</p>
                           <p>"But earth must yield me what bliss it can—you know I have a
                              susceptible nature; this <emph>physical perfection</emph> of mine is a
                              tempter, you know; had we parted as <emph>lovers</emph> instead of
                              cousins, I should, no doubt, have deprived myself of rich experiences.
                              I should have tortured myself for every smile you bestowed on another,
                              and in duty should have placed a guard over my heart to ward off
                              shafts from all other bewitching eyes, gleaming smiles, and
                              love-engendering dimples, not your own; and it is a very luxury to my
                              nature to bask in the light of a lovely woman's smile. Once I did
                              dream (it was a foolish dream) that a beautiful girl—all that
                              incorporate humanity could be, or demand—would give herself to me,
                              would lavish upon me all her golden smiles and jewelled love glances;
                              I would have been miserly of those treasures, would have guarded them
                              with life, and fortune, and sacred honor! That girl denied me the
                              coveted gem, and I am comforting myself with other soothing, womanly
                              affections. I have lulled the pain in my heart with music tones
                              ravishingly sweet; sunned its gloom in smiles that were passionately
                              lovely; and the new wounds in my heart, by the very anguish of their
                              bliss, have obliterated those olden pangs. Yes, you were right; I
                              shall have richer experience of what woman can give me, with you as my
                                 <emph>cousin.</emph> I shall not <emph>lose</emph> you; I could not
                              bear that even yet; you shall be my <emph>best</emph> friend
                              until———You shall be my confidante; I will bare my heart to you in all
                              its phases; of it you shall learn what man thinks of woman, and you
                              may learn some lessons of woman herself, that you have never yet
                              studied. In return, you may give me the history of your soul's
                              progress. There may be strange developments before the end comes, and
                              you will be mine in the better world, where you have promised yourself
                              to me. It will not mar that heavenly marriage, if my
                                 <emph>physical</emph> nature here is at sometime married to
                              another, and until then you shall be, as now, my darling
                                 <emph>cousin.</emph>
                           </p>
                           <p>"AUG. 17.—I was called from you yesterday by an engagement with one of
                              my new charmers. I must describe Cora Lanier to you, Mag; but no, her
                              glorious, languishing, dark eyes are indescribable. She is not like
                              you—her form is full, rounded to voluptuousness. She is a true
                              Southerner; a creature born of light and sunshine, genius and passion.
                              Her only fault—if it is a fault—is her dazzling frankness. At times
                              when the velvet eyes look up so softly, the lips make confessions that
                              are startling; one's passions tingle, one's nature is hurried into
                              temptation. I must guard myself; my manhood must protect her—protect
                              the sweet, soft weakness of her passionate womanhood. We rode together
                              down to the far-famed cave of Ittachooma—or 'Broken Arrow.' We went
                              together to Cupid's Grotto for inspiration; and then wandered alone to
                              Mount Rigi, with our passion-stricken souls, and looked off upon
                              Huntsville in the distance. Nature was in her propitious mood; we
                              exulted in her glory here. The land of the South—our home—the home of
                              love and passion; we were true children of this beautiful land, and
                              ours was a royal heritage!</p>
                           <p>"But I find it difficult to 'confess,' even to you, Mag. You
                                 <emph>shall know me</emph>—all my passion—all my strength—all my
                              weakness. God knows I loved you!</p>
                           <p>"We roved on together, and our eyes wandered together over the
                              mountains of Valhermosa—the Switzerland of Alabama—the 'Vale of the
                              Beautiful.' We gazed away upon the savannahs of green, studded with
                              pearly cotton-blossoms and waving corn, with its golden bloom; and
                              soft zephyrs breathed passionate perfume upon our senses, till the
                              little hand that was nestling so near my heart, trembled as my
                              prisoner; it sought my clasp <emph>so</emph> lovingly, I
                                 <emph>could</emph> not refuse it shelter. The eyes languished up to
                              mine; the head rested itself upon my heart; my bewildered arms clasped
                              her; I drank a thousand kisses from those lips, and they were
                                 <emph>all returned!</emph> I went mad with passion—and then upon my
                              knees entreated her to leave me, for heaven and earth were rocking
                              beneath me! Thank God—for me—Lizzie and Guy Erwin came.</p>

                           <p>"AUG. 20.—Cora left for Marion two days since. Language has no power
                              to express my thoughts. But I leave this subject <emph>now and

                              delightful—parents and Sis—and, according to the signs of the times, a
                              brother-in-law in prospect. I am in a state of resignation. I have
                              told you of my friend, Guy Erwin, as I have made confession to him of
                              you.</p>
                           <p>"I have been amusing myself by comparing and contrasting the styles of
                              northern and southern belledom. You know I have something of a
                              northern education, and have the vanity to consider myself a
                              connoisseur of belles universally. A southern lady has an air as if
                              born to command; she exacts homage, takes it as her right, and
                              chivalry is the element of a southern gentleman. The queenliness of a
                              southern lady is somewhat the result of our peculiar institution.
                              Accustomed to the service of servants who almost lose their own
                              identity in their reverence for their mistresses, the lady
                              unconsciously exacts homage and service from inferiors—for we consider
                              our servants an <emph>inferior race</emph>—never destined in slavery
                              to be a white man's equal. And North and South, you know, we exact
                                 <emph>service</emph> of servants, white or black. We do not
                              associate with them as our peers.</p>
                           <p>"Sometimes I think the chivalry of southern society is owing to a
                              Waverley education. One never meets a trained belle here who is not
                              perfectly familiar with every character of those romances, from
                              Rebecca the Jewess down to Meg Merrilies; from Flora McIvor or Di
                              Vernon to Jeannie Deans. I have never met the luxurious grace, the air
                              of royalty in a northern lady, the deference received as a right,
                              which is native to the South.</p>
                           <p>"A northern lady treats her servant more as an equal, but with less of
                              love. We consider servants as an <emph>inferior</emph> race—intended
                              by God as our servants. We love them—not as equals, but as part of our
                              families, for whom we must care, or as children who have never learned
                              to think, who never will learn to think for themselves. But we think
                              the inferior race of America to be almost infinitely superior to the
                              barbarous tribes of Africa. As a whole, the South would be deadly
                              opposed to the reopening of that African slave trade.</p>
                           <p>"It <emph>may</emph> be that in <emph>God's</emph> time—not man's time
                              (we believe a God over-rules the destinies of men) in God's time the
                              Christianized races in America may be the means of redeeming those
                              brutal hordes of Africa from their barbarism; and the beautiful
                              savannahs of Soudan flourish into cultivation, civilization, and
                              Christianity, by the instrumentality of <emph>Slavery in
                                 America.</emph> Noble men in this country have dreamed that dream,
                              and sacrificed much for it. Dr. Ross, the pro-slavery champion of
                              Huntsville and the South, gave up a princely fortune for the
                              emancipation of his servants. The well-known Chief Justice Taney, of
                              the U. S. Supreme Court, has done the same. Who shall dare sit in
                              judgment on the consciences of men like these? Perhaps the servants
                              thus freed were like the Israelites freed from Egyptian bondage—not
                              prepared for the <emph>hardships</emph> of freedom. They rebelled
                              against their deliverers, and cried out to return to the slavery and
                              flesh-pots of Egypt again, even though the God of the Hebrews had
                              wrought wonders for their deliverance, and was working daily miracles
                              for their salvation. But my sweet cousin must pardon my wandering pen.
                              I did not intend that my dissertation on types of development in
                              belledom should become a discussion of southern institutions. You may
                              have these opinions as those <emph>born</emph> to a conservative
                              southern man.</p>
                           <p>"AUG. 23.—It is night, Cousin Mag. I have left a brilliant company in
                              the parlors, all discussing that theme most interesting to gods and
                              men—LOVE, in its eternal variations. 'Belles passées' were moralizing
                              it; belles musical were performing it over the piano, with
                              accompaniments of soft glances and sweet human tones of song. Lizzy
                              and Guy took it in the form of a game of chess. They played deep,
                              too—a rare game—if I can judge of the signs of the times. He has
                              staked his heart and hand against hers on the game; she has accepted
                              the wager. Sis was a little excited and made some reckless moves,
                              exposing her queen needlessly. She will be easily check-mated. Guy was
                              excited but cool. He intends to win, and to claim the stakes. If he
                              does, he captures two queens. No hope for Sis, losing or winning; her
                              case is desperate, I see. She has my sympathy.</p>
                           <p>"My partner in the universal theme was an intellectual lady from
                              Huntsville. We discussed love in a course of philosophy as recklessly
                              as Guy and Lizzy risked it.</p>
                           <p>"AUG. 24.—Guy won the game. I envied him, Mag. You recollect I
                                 <emph>lost</emph> in my game of hearts. I shall perfect myself in
                              the art of winning, before I risk another failure. I am an assiduous

                              gaze, a soft look, a glance of proud but 'melting tenderness.' Hearts
                              are rare things in this world, cousin; most of them are of the elastic
                              kind, cannot be injured by any pressure. Action and reaction being
                              equal, they rebound—expand when the pressure is removed. However, I
                              know two or three ladies who possess <emph>hearts</emph>—the genuine
                              article.</p>
                           <p>"My partner of last night is a true woman; there is a world of emotion
                              in her restless, blue eye; the soul that radiates through must have
                              passed through the ordeal of thought and suffering. Intellectual
                              beauty is dearly bought; its price is burning thought and
                              soul-torture; a woman exchanges for it the sunny freshness of youth
                              and its delicate bloom. I did not study her glory by
                                 <emph>moonlight,</emph> as I did your charms, Mag, when they burst
                              upon me like an apocalypse. Do you remember that moonlight? She was
                              reclining on an ottoman at my feet, by the 'light of a chandelier,'
                              where I could look down upon the satin brown hair, and into the deep,
                              thoughtful eyes.</p>
                           <p>"'Love must be immortal,' she said, 'because it is one of the elements
                              of our being—a <emph>part</emph> of the soul itself—and if the soul
                              lives forever, then the love must live forever with it.'</p>
                           <p>"'Your creed is a sweet delusion,' I replied. 'Love is a passion—its
                              elements are earthly; it is only selfish; because it is a passion of
                              earth, it must die on earth.'</p>
                           <p>"'I cannot, and will not believe it. We are made in the image of God.
                              God is love—even sin has not obliterated the image of God entirely. If
                              one spirit ever has truly loved another, its love became a part of its
                              life and being, and that spirit, whether embodied or disembodied, is
                              loving still, and will love forever.'</p>
                           <p>"'You do not know love,' I replied. 'It is utterly selfish. Let us
                              analyze it! What is my love for you? In your eyes I see dawning some
                              holy emotion, as pity, gentleness; in <emph>your</emph> face their
                              garb is lovely—they imprint themselves upon your perfect features in
                              forms of winning beauty. I love that dove-like sweetness—the beauty is
                              grateful to my senses; but carry them to their extremes, too much
                              submission, too much gentleness palls upon the taste—the charm becomes
                              insipid. I would give much to win your love. If you gave it <emph>too
                                 freely,</emph> or unasked, it would lose its value, and you would
                              lose with it my respect. Love is sweetest when it is forbidden; a
                              woman should be careful not to give even love too freely when asked;
                              it soon cloys upon the taste, and is changed to contempt. My wife must
                              never let me know that she loves me too fondly."</p>
                           <p>"'You have skepticism in your nature,' she said, laughing. 'You would
                              say that love is merely an intoxication to which all humanity are

                              harmonize into beauty; but, Anna Mortimer, if you do not curb that

                           <p>"'You are a skillful sophist,' she said. 'You can almost make the

                              exhausted your charms, and I am sated with even your regal beauty,
                              then love must die; when your wit ceases to rouse me, and your music
                              tones can no longer beguile me to the lethargy of royal dreams, then

                              says we may. You'll give your consent, won't you?'</p>
                           <p>"'Most certainly, my dear child!' answered mother, laughing. 'After
                              maneuvering for two years to dispose of you, without success, I
                              embrace the first opportunity with delight, to see you safely married,
                              and off my hands.'</p>
                           <p>"'I am <emph>so</emph> grateful! We can go straight along and do it,
                              Guy.'</p>
                           <p>"'Have done with your nonsense, Lizzy! Major Erwin, don't let that
                              mad-cap run away with your senses; she has lost her own.'</p>
                           <p>"'She has <emph>stolen</emph> mine; and I intend to take her before a
                              magistrate this very day and make her give up the lost goods.'</p>
                           <p>"'You'll go and see it done, won't you, Charlie?' Guy asked.</p>
                           <p>"'You are both <emph>beside yourselves,</emph>' was my reply.</p>
                           <p>"'Yes, I believe we are; at least I am <emph>beside myself,</emph>'
                              said Guy, as he looked down upon Lizzy. 'Am I not, Pussy? We are
                                 <emph>one, you</emph> know—the links of the chain shall be fastened
                              to day.'</p>
                           <p>"'Guy, if it was any other man than yourself, I should order coffee
                              and pistols for two, in the morning.'</p>
                           <p>"'For <emph>three,</emph> you mean, brother,' Sis put in; 'you know I
                              shall be obliged to breakfast with Guy.'</p>
                           <p>"'I'll be responsible for you, Pussy,' said Guy; 'recollect you are
                              but <emph>half</emph> of me. You'll go, of course, Moore.'</p>
                           <p>"'Yes; I'll go to keep you out of mischief. You need some cool-headed
                              person like myself to take care of you. Anna Mortimer will like to
                              ride.'</p>
                           <p>"We all went together. Col. White and Addie Mortimer accompanied us. I
                              didn't fancy the joke, but couldn't suppose them to be serious. After
                              riding a few miles, we concluded we had humored the matter
                              sufficiently; told Guy so, and turned our horses to drive back. Here
                              came the knot in the thread. Guy declared it was no joke at all—they
                              were in solemn earnest. Then followed a council of
                              war—expostulations—threats. I told Erwin he would be obliged to answer
                              for it to me. He told me I should have a shot at him as soon as I
                              pleased, declaring that he was bound to do it before he died. Lizzy
                              was headstrong, and declared: 'I should shoot her instead of Guy, for
                              it was her fault. She intended to be married any way, and she dared me
                              to get cross about it, and spoil all mother's comfort by shooting Guy,
                              breaking her heart, and ruining the peace of the family generally. She
                              hoped Guy would be a better<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC6426-00000136"/>
                              son to her father, than to do any such nonsensical thing as to either
                              shoot me, or stand up to be shot at.' To cut the matter short, Mag,
                              the witch carried her point; we all drove to Somerville, and they were
                              married.</p>
                           <p>"When the deed was done past redemption, Lizzy came to her senses; or
                              they took another turn. She burst into tears, and sobbed as though we
                              had all forced her into marriage against her will. I begin to think
                              that the female mind is the most astonishing work of creation,
                              Mag.</p>
                           <p>"'Great heavens!' said Sis, 'what have we done?'</p>
                           <p>"It would have been ridiculous, if the child hadn't seemed in so much
                              trouble about it. I wanted to whip her for being naughty, but gave her
                              over to Guy.</p>
                           <p>"'Too late for that now, Sis,' said I, 'what's done can't be
                              helped—what can't be cured must be endured.'</p>
                           <p>"'Now, brother, you know you ought not to have let me do it! What will
                              Guy think of me?'</p>
                           <p>"'I don't know, Sis; not very well, I'm afraid. He'll think you were
                              entirely wanting in judgment and discretion.'</p>
                           <p>"She sobbed bitterly, and the rest of us commenced laughing.</p>
                           <p>"'Here is a pretty piece of business on your hands, brother Guy,' said
                              I to him; 'you have taken her for better or worse, and she seems to
                              feel no better, but very much <emph>worse</emph> at present.'</p>
                           <p>"Guy looked funny over it.</p>
                           <p>"What <emph>will</emph> you think of me, Guy?' said Lizzy, with a
                              sob.</p>
                           <p>"'I'll think as well as I can of you, Puss, if you'll behave yourself
                              in future. It was a little foolish in you, but it can't be helped, and
                              I'll forgive you, and we'll all shake hands upon it, if you won't cry
                              any more.'</p>
                           <p>"All the world at Valhermosa was in wonder when we drove back, to know
                              what had happened to detain us. As we alighted, there was a crowd on
                              the piazza to whom Col. White introduced Major Guy Erwin and Lady. Guy
                              received the buzz of wonderment and congratulation with gracious
                              dignity, and made way through the crowd to escort his lady to her
                              father, while the brother-in-law of Prof. Giers, the proprietor at
                              Valhermosa, went out to order a volley of guns, to spread the
                                 <emph>report</emph> as far as possible.</p>
                           <p>"'There; I've <emph>done</emph> it, father!' said Lizzie; the tears
                              not yet gone from her eyes. She was trembling, too.</p>
                           <p>"'The devil, you have!' There was a thunder-cloud on his brow that
                              overshadowed his eyes.</p>
                           <p>"'If we have done wrong, sir, the fault is entirely mine,' said Erwin;
                              'and you <emph>see</emph> how irresistible my temptation has been. My
                                 <emph>excuse</emph> is before you—it is too lovely for my
                              strength.'</p>
                           <p>"'We couldn't help it, father, we <emph>couldn't,</emph> indeed! and
                              we'll promise never to do so again, if you'll forgive us this one
                              time; and Guy'll be the best boy you've got, father, for Charlie don't
                              know how to make me obey any way, and Guy understands all about
                              it.'</p>
                           <p>"'Were you a <emph>party</emph> to this piece of business?' asked
                              father of me.</p>
                           <p>"'I have forgiven them, sir,' I answered. 'Sis told me, long ago, that
                              she had a great and ardent longing to see a <emph>man,</emph> and as
                              she declared this one to be the only one she ever did see, I thought
                              it best for her to <emph>secure</emph> him as soon as possible, for
                              you know, sir, if she had waited, he would have found her out, and she
                              would have lost him.'</p>
                           <p>"'That's the way the wind blows! There's some truth in it, I believe.
                              Puss, you wicked rascal, go and comfort your mother; I presume she is
                              in hysterics.'</p>
                           <p>"'I will, if you'll kiss me, father;' and she put up her mouth. 'And
                              now, father, please shake hands with Guy; he's a grand fellow. Isn't
                              he, Charlie?' Guy smiled, and offered his hand—father smiled, and
                              offered his—Sis smiled and ran off to comfort mother—and so the
                              trouble ended.</p>
                           <p>"It is late at night. You see I have posted you on the news while it
                              is fresh in my mind.</p>

                              can teach. I am terribly ennuied, and am to leave here to-morrow.
                              Please direct your answer to Lizzy, at Huntsville; she will forward it
                              to me. Where shall I receive it? God knows! Perhaps in Europe, Asia,
                              Africa, the mountains of South America—perhaps upon the islands of the
                              ocean. To the lessons that earth can teach! Shall I ever learn another
                              as well as the one you taught me? Emerson says love is a development.
                              When we have learned our lesson, we leave it and <emph>advance;</emph>

                           <p>"AUG. 29.—I hope the theme of love has had for me its last variation
                              here. Shall I report what it had to interest me to-night? Mrs. Talbot
                              and Anna Mortimer discussed it with me.</p>
                           <p>"'Love-making to some men is a business, not a luxury,' said Mrs.
                              Talbot—'a business done in broad daylight, where a blush would be out
                              of place; a lady could not show off her appreciation of the fitting
                              and beautiful. Just imagine a man asking the question in a cool,
                              business manner: "Do you think, Miss ——, that you could like me well
                              enough to marry?" May all good spirits defend us from being driven to
                              such extremities as to outrage romance and poetry, by being obliged to
                              accept that style of proposal. The true answer then should be: "Yes,
                              sir, I do want badly to be married and settled off, and as this seems
                              to be the last chance, sir, I am much obliged for it, and thank you
                              kindly!"'</p>
                           <p>"'What hour do you prefer for the love-luxury?' I asked Anna.</p>
                           <p>"'Oh, all hours may be appropriate,' she replied. 'Each hour can have
                              its own peculiar charm. "Variety is the spice," etc. The different
                              styles of charmers demand different hours. A poetic lover would
                              enchant most by moonlight—the intellectual suits the morning, when
                              thought is freshest.'</p>
                           <p>"'Physical beauty would choose a midnight hour, or perchance a dreamy
                              afternoon, but then the surroundings should be mountains, with zephyrs
                              that could bewitch the senses.'"</p>
                           <p>"'What hour do you love best?' asked Anna.</p>
                           <p>"'Moonlight,' I replied, 'with the lull of distant waters. No.
                              Morning, or midnoon, for each hour should be sweeter than the last; my
                              enchantress inspires all hours, till the spirit of Life, which battled
                              with the spirit of Death, from the birth hour of the soul, reigns
                              conqueror, because life is love, and love mightier than death. In
                                 <emph>moments</emph> of existence, ages upon ages of delight sweep
                              in solemn waves over the soul, and roll away amid the <emph>eternal

                  down the barriers of morbid pride, and she saw herself in her selfish deformity.
                  She battled down the surging billows bravely, she would not be overwhelmed.

                           <p>"Dear Mag," it ran, "Charlie left for Huntsville, yesterday, to
                              prepare for a journey to the ends of Christendom—so he said.</p>
                           <p>"He left this letter for you, telling me to add a postscript, but the
                              letter is overgrown, and my postscript shall be in a separate
                              envelope. I suppose he has told you how naughty I have been; but I
                              could not help it, it was <emph>so</emph> romantic. Only think, Guy
                              and I have been devotedly in love for a whole year without knowing it,
                              or knowing each other's names! It was so romantic too, to take it in a
                              game of chess; I always had a passion for chess, and no wonder. It is
                              revealed to me <emph>why,</emph> now. Taken all together, it is so
                              romantic, I can hardly contain myself! It ought to make a
                                 <emph>book,</emph> and Charlie says if I am anxious, he will write
                              one and publish me, or he will give you the items and you can do it.
                              When you do write a book, be sure and make me the heroine. I intend to
                              behave admirably for the rest of my life, so that the dénouement shall
                              be very graceful. Guy tells me that the romance is all over now, that
                              we have seen the very last of it; that he is going to take me to the
                              backwoods of Mississippi, to his plantation, put me in a log house and
                              give me nothing in particular to eat.</p>
                           <p>"I tell him that 'Love in a cottage,' was always my ideal—the cottage
                              to be embowered in roses, jasmins and honeysuckles—with gardens full
                              of fountains and statues, and the cottage parlors carpeted with
                              velvet, and hung with pictures and bird-cages, and all that style of
                              thing. But he tells me that Mississippi log-houses have mud floors;
                              that I shall be all the bird in the cage, though there will be plenty
                              of mocking-birds in the woods; that much as he<pb n="274-275"
                                 xml:id="VAC6426-00000138"/> regrets it, he shall be obliged to
                              starve me, till he builds the other cottage, and I make the roses and
                              honeysuckles grow. The worst of it is, Mag, he means what he says; so
                              when you write your book, you need mention only the <emph>fancy</emph>
                              facts, like the mocking-birds, and life with nature. We shall rival
                              Socrates and Xantippe, of Glenlyn. I tell Guy we shall starve
                                 <emph>together,</emph> 'it will be as broad as it is long,' as
                              Socrates told us. In truth, Mag, I am so sick of society, with its
                              heartlessness and soullessness, that I think 'primitive nature' must
                              be ennobling with such companionship as that of Guy Erwin.</p>
                           <p>"I don't know what to think of Charlie; he acts strangely. He has been
                              flirting with every married lady he meets and is to all appearances
                              perfectly devoted to Miss Mortimer, one of the most intellectual,
                              accomplished, fastidious, beautiful ladies of Huntsville,
                              grand-daughter of ex-Gov. B. I send you a copy of some poetry he
                              published to her, in the 'Huntsville Independent.' I am sure I do not
                              know what to think of it, do you?</p>
                           <p>"I have not forgotten our visit with you; I cannot realize that Cousin
                              Frank is gone! It does not seem possible! But there are some subjects
                              for which there is no language to express emotion! Let us be
                                 <emph>silent,</emph> for God has done it. Kingsley says somewhere:
                              'I believe the Judge of all the earth will do <emph>right,</emph> and
                              what's right can't be <emph>wrong,</emph> nor <emph>cruel</emph>
                              either, else it would not be like Him who loved us to the death.'</p>
                           <p>"We wanted you and Frank to complete our happiness after we left you,
                              at Lake George, Montreal, Nahant, Newport, Niagara, and down the
                              Mississippi, (what an ugly word to write, and your letters must be
                              directed to me, there). I shall hope to have you a visitor in our
                              home, even before we get the jasmins in full blossom. Mais, adieu ma

                  have soothed him with drugs—in vain. She lay struggling with her torture upon the

               <head>XXIII. THE VISITS OF THE TEMPTER.</head>
               <p>LOVE and Jealousy were holding high council.</p>
               <p>"The great hope of youth has perished," said one voice in the council chamber.
                  "Youth's maiden hope, youth's maiden love, noble and pure as the loves of
                  angels—so pure, no dream of passion was permitted to blemish its white innocence.
                  Charles Atherton Moore <emph>knew</emph> she had kept her spirit spotless for
                     <emph>him,</emph> knew she rejected his passion dream, only because she would
                  not dishonor love's bright ideal. He has wronged her, disdained her great pure
                  love, by the unhallowed thoughts burning in his strange epistle; he has marred the
                  gift she bestowed—he has polluted her <emph>first love</emph>—he has dishonored
                     <emph>his own,</emph> in throwing such passion upon her heart. Shall she
                  henceforth forth preserve spotless, what he has flung forth? He has blackened the
                  heart she gave him—it is worthless now to her—down to dust it may go—he has
                  trampled upon it—the world may trample upon it—the great, foul world."</p>
               <p>As she listened to the voice, the sobbing of a mighty woe struggled forth.</p>
               <p>"The first hope of youth is dead—she is burying the dead thing there in her
                  heart," the voice went on—"silently she is laying it in the ashes; her grief is
                  that of a mother over her first born, when she smooths away the silken sunny
                  tresses of her darling, kisses the pale, smiling marble lips, closes the sweet,
                  loving eyes, into which she may look no more forever, straightens the rounded,
                  dimpled hands—the little clasping fingers, that will never cling to her lips
                  again. Oh, God! she buries the dead thing in its lifeless loveliness, down in her
                  heart, and puts it from her sight forever—<emph>forever</emph>—FOREVER! Her love
                  is too pure for earth; born in celestial regions, the elements of earth have
                  tortured it to its death-anguish, and it has fled home, where love is passionless
                  and pure."</p>
               <p>And another voice answered:</p>
               <p>"The love she <emph>rejected</emph> was a pure offering—such as God gave man in
                  his glory—the noblest born of earth—full of sacrifice—the rich gift of an earnest
                  manhood—an unstained offering laid upon the altar, and she has dishonored it, by
                  dreaming of selfishness and passion. Her self-love and mad pride have marred his
                  sacrifice—her selfish pride demanded a deeper homage, a slavish worship, and she
                  has received the reward. That insane pride would torture him to the end; she must
                  drink the cup of its humiliation to the dregs, before she can know peace; or she
                  will give the being she adores, curses in the place of love-blessings."</p>
               <p>The voices maddened her; she could listen no longer; she must <emph>forget;</emph>
                  she rose and walked toward the forests; the birds went on with their songs; the
                  leaves whispered to her as of old; she was oblivious of all things but the grave
                  yawning in her heart—the serpent gnawing at her vitals. She kept on—on—passed the
                  falls—the crags where she had dared him to the abyss; recklessly bounding over
                  them now, for what cared she whether she was dashed into—what? where? She climbed
                  the mountains, found herself beyond them, on the shore of the lake—that
                  lake—unmoored the little boat, and pushed off upon the lake's<pb n="278-279"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000140"/> bosom—not now with him, but "<emph>alone</emph>
                  upon the waters." No, the spirits of nature were with her.</p>
               <p>And nature was <emph>true</emph> to her wayward child.</p>
               <p>Often and often had she thrown herself upon the earth's broad bosom, and felt the
                  joy of a child coming home to its mother—her only mother, "sweet, mother Nature!"
                  Thou wilt purify us from earthly stain, from sin and fierce passion. "Ave
                  sanctissima. Ora pro nobis." She chased down the madness on the winds, bared heart
                  and brow to the gaze of nature's God—the eternal, all-wise God—took the heart,
                  broken at last, crushed out of all semblance of womanliness—took its senseless
                  fragments, whose every atom of flesh and blood had quivered in frantic pain—gave
                  it back to the Creator as a <emph>worse than useless thing!</emph> But the
                  intellect! That might find food and companionship with the noble and gifted of the
                  ages; that should find life in the solitary places; that should make them blossom
                  as the rose.</p>
               <p>She was no longer weary. The waters rocked her little boat with a murmured
                  lullaby, and she gave herself up to dreams.</p>
               <p>Self-deceived still—for when did mortal ever learn all the deep things of his own
                  nature. The tempter came to her in her visions, and she listened.</p>
               <p>He came with the strange, sweet voices of the waves, as if calling from their
                  beautiful homes. The low, rippling laughter was music to her loveless heart; a
                  spirit within her rose eagerly to hear their thrilling call.</p>
               <p>"Come down to us, heart-weary wanderer! Come, wild dreamer! We will clasp you in
                  our arms, oh, so lovingly, and <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>'Rest more sweet and still than ever nightfall gave,</l>
                        <l>Your longing heart shall fill in the world beyond the grave.'</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> Come home! home to your <emph>father's</emph> embrace—home to your
                     <emph>mother's</emph> love." And another soft, familiar cry echoed far away on
                  her bewildered senses: "Come <emph>home,</emph> Mag! come <emph>home!</emph> I am
                     <emph>waiting</emph> for you!"</p>
               <p>Was it Frank? <emph>Where</emph> was he? <emph>Where</emph> in all the universe of
                  the eternal?</p>
               <p>How many an aching heart has asked that question of God and the soul, concerning
                  loved ones! How many have gone mad with the doubt, as Mag did, at thought of
                  Frank's destiny. The Scribes and Pharisees had damned him—sent him away, without a
                  hope of mercy, as a reprobate. He had "given no conclusive evidences of piety."
                  Even the charitable only "<emph>hoped</emph> he had gone to a good country,
                     <emph>poor fellow!</emph> they were sorry for him."</p>
               <p>And Mag had laughed in very bitterness at what she heard. "She hoped to go to the
                  'sphere' that he inhabited, especially if the over-pious, like Mr. Brown and
                  Grandma Barclay, were to be the sole inhabitants of that 'better land.'"</p>
               <p>She fortified herself with the belief learned from Parks, that when good men gave
                  God attributes that shocked the noblest attributes of man's nature, those men must
                  have <emph>mistaken</emph> God.</p>
               <p>She believed in a hell, from what she saw of hypocrisy, bigotry, and
                  self-righteousness among the Pharisees. She believed that those who permitted such
                  evil to expand in their natures, would progress to a most terrible destiny, for it
                  seemed in the <emph>nature</emph> of things. And when she saw earthly lust—the
                  liar, the hypocrite, the libertine—putting on the garb of the saint on earth, she
                  believed that such would find the purity of heaven itself, a burning hell.</p>
               <p>Again and again the wild, sweet call vibrated along her senses: "Come
                     <emph>home,</emph> Mag! I am <emph>waiting</emph> for you! I, who love you! Oh,
                  come home to me, Mag! Oh, come <emph>home!</emph>"</p>
               <p>She gazed down into the bright depths of the waves; she listened to the low call,
                  as to the voice of an angel, and a smile wreathed her lip, answering the smile in
                  the heart of the white water-lilies; she watched the sunbeams as they kissed the
                  silver lips of the flowers; the pearly pebbles gleaming up from their couch down
                  in the waters, and an unutterable longing filled her soul to lie down in the
                  embrace of the friendly waves, and sleep with the gems and blossoms forever.</p>
               <p>The same familiar voice echoed to her again from the winds of heaven, whispering
                  eager, loving words, breathing the earnest cry:</p>
               <p>"Come away to freedom! Your nature is becoming polluted by its life with the
                  ignoble! Unfetter your spirit! Tear loose your heart from its chains! Come up to
                     <emph>freedom!</emph> The heaven within you is growing black with passion! The
                  divine within you is suffocating! No love binds you to earth now! Come home, where
                  love, and knowledge, and joy are as intense as heaven is beautiful and
                     <emph>free!</emph> Come home to <emph>freedom!</emph>"</p>
               <pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC6426-00000141"/>
               <p>The tones swept away in a sweet, wooing sigh, on which her very life seemed
                  gushing. But her spirit, rising, answered:</p>
               <p>"No! no! no! It is not you, Frank! It is the tempter who has come to me with your
                  voice. I will not be a dastard, in my fear of meeting earthly sorrow and pain. No
                  earthly misery can make a coward of the brave! 'What, <emph>die</emph> for terror
                  of a lonely life?' <emph>die</emph> for terror of long years of loveless solitude?
                  die for fear of men or demons on earth? Never! What earth has to teach of grim
                  want, or woe, or degradation, that will I <emph>dare</emph> learn! what love, or
                  hatred, or <emph>despair</emph> can teach, that also dare I learn! I will not
                  slight the lessons. If there is a God he will protect his own. If evil
                     <emph>must</emph> be triumphant—if I <emph>must</emph> wrap my soul in curses
                  as a garment, I will go down to the abyss <emph>smiling.</emph>
                  <ref rend="super" target="#note_002" xml:id="return_002">*</ref>

               </note>
               <p>And Mag did go on her way <emph>smiling,</emph> and no tears watered her heart for
                  long, long years. She smiled even then as she breathed the infidel's prayer: "Oh,
                  God, if there be a God, help me to the hereafter, if there be a hereafter!"</p>
               <p>The restless spirit was aroused, it could no longer endure repose upon the waters.
                  Again she stirred the blood stagnating in her pulses, and chased down the madness
                  upon the winds.</p>
               <p>Then the forests spoke to the child of nature—spoke in their grand loveliness,
                  from the beetling rocks and dark-browed mountains:</p>
               <p>"Are there not other mountains, and valleys, and oceans; and beyond the oceans the
                  lands of your glory-dreams? And you are emancipated at length, the last link is
                  severed that binds you to your race—lover and friend have forsaken you—you too
                  shall be a rover—you shall find out mysterious secrets from your kind—human hearts
                  shall yield their mysteries to you—secrets that <emph>women seldom learn;</emph>
                  you too shall traverse strange countries, and see strange nations. Are you not
                     <emph>at bay</emph> with the world—with man—with God? The world shall yield up
                  its treasures to you; you <emph>shall</emph> find <emph>homes</emph> beyond the
                  seas; your foot shall tread the lands of the Orient—the hills of Judea—the valleys
                  of the land of pilgrims; your brow shall cool its fever in the dews of Hermon;
                  your locks may whiten in Araby, toward the last bourne of the traveller; but
                  cross, crescent and crown shall pass before you; the God of Mohammedan, Pagan and
                  Christian—the one God of the universe, if he exists, shall guide you, as with a
                  pillar of fire, through the terrible night—you shall walk through fire by his
                  burning light, unto the fiery end."</p>
               <p>Rest must follow passion. Exhaustion follows the wild strife of spirit in flesh.
                  Well for mortals that action and reaction are equal—that nature works by wise
                     <emph>laws</emph> for spirit and flesh.</p>
               <p>Mag had a life-problem to solve; she had studied on it often before—how to work
                  out a noble woman's destiny. She had hoped for human <emph>love</emph> as a
                  stimulus to her work; now she must solve the problem alone and loveless, for lover
                  and friend had deserted her.</p>
               <p>In her nights and days of sorrow, when she had tried to intoxicate herself into
                  forgetfulness of the unkind words that in her home-life were eating, like vipers
                  at her heart, she had written much. In her desk was a MS. on
                     <emph>Skepticism.</emph> All the doubt of man and God that pain had taught her,
                  she had written in a book, thinking that at some future time it should be
                  published, and dedicated to all the <emph>young,</emph> whom <emph>sorrow</emph>
                  had led astray from God. Her heart yearned for those who had learned that terrible
                     <emph>doubt,</emph> because of their earth-anguish, and she longed to find God
                  for them. The wise, and good, and noble would not do it for her, but she would
                  trace all her own wretched wanderings to find God for those who were tempted in
                  their youth to wander from him, and she would dedicate her book to them, with a
                     <emph>great yearning love. God knew she loved them.</emph> Now was the time to
                  finish her work. If there was a God, he would help her—he would <emph>direct her
                     paths,</emph> for he had <emph>promised it faithfully</emph> in his Holy
                  Word.</p>
               <p>Softer feelings came, sweet, soothing feelings, a gush of her olden child-faith,
                  as when she had knelt and prayed to Our Father that Frank should be given back to
                  her, because she could not <emph>live</emph> without him. Once more, with a rush
                  of tenderness, she knelt there in the forests, and asked God for Christ's sake, to
                     <emph>direct her</emph> in all things—<emph>in</emph> ALL <emph>things.</emph>
                  She poured out her very soul in pleading, that he would help her in her now
                  loveless orphanage, to work out a noble woman's destiny; to aid her on her
                  book—she would stake her faith upon it. If he existed, would he reveal himself<pb
                     n="282-283" xml:id="VAC6426-00000142"/> by helping her to her life-work thus
                  far, that one little book.</p>
               <p>For one short week, that faith in God sustained Magdalene Barclay, and then by a
                  strange experience which maddened her—a strange experience which is a <emph>true
                     experience,</emph> and that is why it is recorded in these pages, and which she
                  herself may relate in her own mad way hereafter—by a strange experience which,
                  young as she was, influenced all her future development—and perhaps that was why
                  God permitted it—her faith was shattered again.</p>
               <p>As she rose from her knees, she heard a voice:</p>
               <p>"Magdalene Barclay! Magdalene Barclay!"</p>
               <p>It was not Frank. Would God it were! She looked up and met Min's radiant eyes.</p>
               <p>"We have looked through every valley, hill and glen, and into every cave, tree,
                  and bush of Glenlyn to discover where the fairies had led you."</p>
               <p>The blood was careering even yet so wildly in her veins, it could not stop to
                  mantle her cheeks with blushes at the ardent gaze of Min's companion, Richard
                  Hudson Ely. She managed to greet them cordially, and Min in her own style
                  whispered with a bright look:</p>
               <p>"We have come to secure you and May Burton as bridesmaids. It is all settled at
                  last, for the sixteenth of October—three months. You are to go with us to-day to
                  Brother Everett's in Hartford; give a vacation for a week, to help me prepare the
                  preparations!"</p>
               <p>"You poor child!" said Mag.</p>
               <p>"But where has May Burton spirited Alec? She directed the search for you, like a
                  wise individual who knows all your ways—being persevering in the pursuit of
                  knowledge under difficulties; also in the pursuit of knowlege venders."</p>
               <p>"How shall I be able to manage Min, Miss Barclay?" asked Mr. Ely. "You have had
                  her under tuition, and may give me some useful hints. She has employed herself
                  to-day in lecturing me on my <emph>duties.</emph> One would conclude that duty had
                  been the only study of her life-time. Is that what you have taught her?"</p>
               <p>"Duty is a very enormous affair in the eyes of the initiated, Mr. Ely," responded
                  Mag. "It is often an item of immense expense to the conscience."</p>
               <p>"And it requires great care, prudence, forethought and afterthought to know it
                  thoroughly," said Min. "How is it to be supposed that an innocent young man like
                  Mr. Hudson Ely, should be posted on the necessities? I have only been fulfilling
                  my duty by enlightening him."</p>
               <p>"'Angels and ministers of grace'—et cetera!" quoth Ely.</p>
               <p>"Yes," responded Mag.</p>
               <p>"He says he has given me his heart to preserve. It was a thoughtful thing in him,
                  as we end all love affairs by going to housekeeping, and studying the mysteries of
                  preserves and pickles. I am very fond of all 'goodies' in that line."</p>
               <p>"Min insists upon keeping my heart in a pickle. It is getting dreadfully soured
                  already."</p>
               <p>"It is in an excellent state of preservation. I keep it in spirits, hoping it
                  won't ferment too much for table-use. Here is a wild rose-bud that you may
                  preserve for me." And Min fastened it in his button-hole.</p>
               <p>"And altogether she keeps me in a complete stew."</p>
               <p>"There is a necessity that he should know what to expect in the future. Besides
                  these love-pickles to pay for, I have tried to enlighten him on the shoe-bills he
                  will have to foot, the glove-bills to handle. He pays his addresses to me very
                  generously now, offering <emph>more than half his last crust and blanket.</emph> I
                  am afraid he will put on another face when he pays for other dresses. You know I
                  shall want to make myself attractive to him always. I think I am exquisitely
                  pretty now, and if he furnishes me with a sufficient quantity of silks, satins,
                  moire-antiques, and that style of thing, I think I can manage to win his
                  admiration for a long time yet. And then, besides, I have promised to take
                  particular pains with his buttons, and all the holes in the elbows of his
                  sleeves."</p>
               <p>"Isn't she a person of alarming forethought?" asked Ely.</p>
               <p>"Let me tell you a secret," Min went on. "The stupidest business that two people
                  ever entered upon is an 'engagement.' Never become 'engaged,' Mag. It will do to
                  be 'engaging.' Getting in love is nice! ever so pretty! one is
                     <emph>interested</emph> in the progress of affairs; one is in such funny
                  suspense all the time, watching whether the bird can be caught or not; but when it
                  once perches on one's finger, the interest is over; one has no particular use for
                  it; one can say sweet things a short time—chirrup to it; but then one feels like
                  sitting down in a corner with one's thumb in one's mouth, to look at it! If it
                  would only try to fly away, it might be amusing to prevent it; but if it won't
                  fly, why one must out of duty try to amuse it, and it isn't very amusing<pb
                     n="284-285" xml:id="VAC6426-00000143"/> after all, nor very easily amused; and
                  then one feels like opening the window for it, and saying in Uncle Toby fashion,
                  'Go, little bird, this world is big enough for both of us.' Moreover, I think that
                  yonder bird in the tree is very beautiful; I wonder if I could not coo him down to
                  my finger and let you go free."</p>
               <p>"Isn't she amusing? When I get her entirely I shall shut her up to look at.
                  Between you and I, Miss Barclay, she is a witch; but she isn't <emph>wise,</emph>
                  and that is why she is so very charming. Min, I have a great favor to implore of
                  you—never grow <emph>wise.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Never!" said Min, with determination.</p>
               <p>"It will be a sufficient cause for divorce, if you ever do."</p>
               <p>"H'm!" said Mag, "that is very pretty to <emph>talk</emph> about, but it takes
                  people of the most unbounded discretion to 'do' nonsense with a charm. Nonsense is
                  the most superfine sense, and needs the most careful management."</p>
               <p>"The highest wisdom."</p>
               <p>"There sit Alec and May Burton," exclaimed Min, "hammering out rocks as usual. No
                  doubt, he has a pocketful; what a wise head she keeps on her little shoulders! I
                  am so thankful that I shall never have all her 'talents' to answer for! Mine will
                  all develop into housekeeping. You will, of course, give me the key to your bank.
                  I know that I have 'talents' for ruining a man equal to any lady you could find in
                  the <emph>Union.</emph> If that remark resembles a pun, Mag, it was not
                  intended—purely accidental, I'll assure you."</p>
               <p>They left Alec and May Burton to study geology, walked home, and entered the
                  parlor.</p>
               <p>"Please, Min, run out and talk to Aunt Lina, and let me take charge of Mr. Ely
                  while you are gone." Min laughed.</p>
               <p>"Which being interpreted, means, 'Go and coax Aunt Lina to get a new frock for you
                  to be bridesmaid.'"</p>
               <p>Mr.Ely commenced turning the leaves of some books on the table.</p>
               <p>"Min tells me you are particularly interested in southern literature. I see you
                  have 'Bernard Lile' and 'Mustang Gray.' Anything from Huntsville is
                  interesting."</p>
               <p>Mag "stood fire" marvellously under the circumstances, for the shot tore to the
                  vitals, and burnt there, as fire never burnt.</p>
               <p>"What do you think of Mr. Clemens, the statesman-author?"</p>
               <p>"There are chapters in his books," answered Mag, "that inspire one like martial
                  music—like the echoes of solitary bugle-notes among mountains—but the books sadden
                  me; I only read them when tempted to yield to the evil passions that try to force
                  all souls downward. One infers that Mr. Clemens believes in total
                  depravity—degradation past redemption. A woman feels unsafe after reading him, as
                  if men gave themselves utterly to the evil in their natures, and became worse than
                  brutes—devils upon earth. This I believe to be too true often upon earth, but
                  dwelling upon the thought tends to give one a hopeless emotion. I must work out my
                  destiny <emph>alone</emph> in this world, and am anxious to meet <emph>men</emph>
                  in it, instead of demons. Mr. Clemens assures me I shall have both to encounter,
                  and the latter must be foiled."</p>
               <p>"He shows the saddest side of a great truth, as all history proves."</p>
               <p>"I turn from his teachings to those of Paul, the philosopher, who knew all the
                  demoniac that a Nero and Agrippina could teach, with a feeling of relief. Paul
                  tells us 'Whatsoever things are <emph>true, honest, just, pure, lovely and of good
                     report, if</emph> there be any virtue, and <emph>if</emph> there be any praise,
                     <emph>think on these things.</emph>'"</p>
               <p>Mag added thoughtfully, after a silence:</p>
               <p>"Yes, it is a <emph>purification</emph> to <emph>think</emph> of the good, the
                  true, and the beautiful. The Man-God taught as no one else ever taught, a glorious
                     <emph>truth,</emph> that our <emph>thought is our education in purity. Purity
                     of thought is purity of life.</emph>"</p>
               <p>Min returned from her mission to Aunt Lina.</p>
               <p>"The 'powers' are propitious, Mag; you shall have a new frock. Aunt Lina says she
                  is thankful to learn that I intend to ruin my 'bo,' and you may do your best to
                  help me; and she does hope you will succeed in catching some foolish fellow before
                  you get much worse. It must be some one that don't know you too well. She is in
                  splendid humor.</p>
               <p>"Weddings always do put ladies in good humor."</p>
               <p>"Now for the paraphernalia," Min went on.</p>
               <p>"High-heeled shoes," suggested Mr. Ely.</p>
               <p>"Mag and I can dispense with your help on these arrangements. It is settled that
                  Alec shall attend to Mag and May. He has a conspiracy for securing May, by putting
                  Mag in charge of that young <emph>artist,</emph> Mason Rivers, his last partner in
                  a Jonathan and David friendship. He will paint you if you will only look sweet. I
                  intend to sit for a Venus myself—you shall be Psyche."</p>
               <pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC6426-00000144"/>
               <p>"There is trouble, Min! The ordination of our new minister, Mr. Latham, comes off
                  on the sixteenth, and I am on the programme for music. I know the professor will
                  not excuse me. What can be done?"</p>
               <p>"Alec shall make the arrangements tally, and you need not go ahead of the music,
                  either. That is all settled," said Min.</p>
               <p>And so it was; yet from the week of experience at Everett Walton's, Mag returned
                  with the life-problem, and her <emph>faith</emph> again in a very unsettled
                  condition. There was a wrecked faith, mad pride, mad love and mad jealousy warring
                  within her, and with it all, she said some very wild things, and did some very
                  reckless ones, as many another girl has done, when insane with such passions,
                  without growing either in goodness, purity, or womanliness.</p>
               <p>Busy she kept herself, and that was well; she needed employment to keep down the
                  rebellion that was now making sport of her faith, in that wild riot of passions.
                  Night after night, when she knelt by her couch, trying to renew that sweet gush of
                  olden child-faith—it had been wonderfully sweet, as it came to her in the
                  wilderness—tempting fiends came mocking her with the old cry, "There is no God!
                  There is no God!" She remembered that she had knelt down and <emph>thanked
                     God</emph> for the <emph>blessing of that letter</emph> from Charles Atherton
                  Moore. The demons mocked her for that. She had asked God to <emph>direct her
                     footsteps,</emph> and he had led her to the brink of the pit. And now the
                  demons were around her, mocking her in her solitude; dark, grim, and ghastly, they
                  seemed floating around her in weird dances, pointing their shadowy, frightful
                  fingers at the serpents writhing in her heart, and mingling their pealing laughter
                  with the hissing of the serpents. Those were long, passionate, prayerless nights.
                  Well for her that the day was busy.</p>
               <p>The sixteenth of October came at last—a golden autumn day; Nature exultant in
                  robes of purple and crimson.</p>
               <p>Mag and May Burton attended the minister's ordination. When the last anthem was
                  over, and their voices could be excused from the choir, they left the church to
                  arrange bridal bouquets, and then rode off to Min's home. They passed over a
                  mountain road which ran through rugged gorges. Mag's escort was the artist, Mason
                  Rivers, and they admired the beauty for their mutual entertainment. They came to a
                  cascade down a glen by the road-side; both alighted to let their souls go rioting
                  with loveliness, Mag threw off her hat—her brow was hot, her temples burning; she
                  bathed them in the cool waters, and threw back the brown tresses. As she bent over
                  the stream, dabbling her fingers in the drops, and wishing her blood would ooze
                  itself away, the young artist gathered a wild vine, and wreathed it gallantly
                  around her brow.</p>
               <p>"I crown thee Ophelia—the <emph>perfect woman.</emph>"</p>
               <p>A glance of bitter pain darted up from Mag's eyes, as she replied:</p>
               <p>"Ophelia, who died broken-hearted, because of the very perfection of her
                  womanliness."</p>
               <p>"The coronal shall be for Josephine, <emph>empress of hearts.</emph>" And he
                  fastened it among the brown tresses.</p>
               <p>"Josephine who died broken-hearted, because of the very perfection of her woman's
                  magnanimity and devotion."</p>
               <p>"Who died when her woman's mission was accomplished. She was ministering angel to
                  the last—she laid her heart upon the altar to be consumed by slow fire; she coined
                  every drop of its blood into blessings on her country, her lord and emperor."</p>
               <p>"Is it the only destiny of a perfect woman, to make vain sacrifices?"</p>
               <p>"A woman's <emph>power</emph> lies in patient love and sacrifice; her mission is
                  to <emph>purify</emph>—to walk with unspotted garments amid guilt and passion, to
                  win and conquer by the might of her devotion. Had Lady Byron been a Josephine, had
                  she <emph>given</emph> her lord love instead of <emph>demanding</emph> it, given
                  it patiently even in wrong, lavished it with forgiveness and meekness, she might
                  have <emph>redeemed</emph> Byron. Josephine forgave Beauharnais, wrongs deeper
                  than any that Lady Byron had to forgive. The dissipated husband did his worst to
                  soil his wife's spotless name, when he claimed a divorce from her, yet when, three
                  years afterward, he asked to be forgiven, then Josephine forgave and loved him.
                  Had Lady Byron been capable of conceiving such magnanimity, what might not Byron
                  himself have become? His actions proved that he had noble impulses. But few women
                  dream of the power and purification that lies in the meek and loving sacrifice of
                  a strong spirit."</p>
               <p>"But there are some natures so strong from birth, that soft, loving womanliness
                  can never become developed in them."</p>
               <p>"Yes, women destitute of <emph>hearts</emph>—a hideous and dangerous<pb
                     n="288-289" xml:id="VAC6426-00000145"/> gerous progeny—creatures with womanly
                  forms and masculine natures. Human nature sickens at the thought of them."</p>
               <p>"Margaret Fuller was a being to reverence."</p>
               <p>"Margaret Fuller had a large heart—hers was a noble, intellectual, masculine
                  nature. She was not a woman for a strong man to love <emph>as man loves
                     woman;</emph> she found as her mate a pure feminine nature in masculine
                  form."</p>
               <p>Mag changed the discourse suddenly.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Rivers, I have always had a distracting proclivity for breaking my neck.
                  Suppose you help me now to accomplish the feat."</p>
               <p>"Never! Death is not for such as you! You are to accomplish the destiny of
                  Josephine first."</p>
               <p>"Well," said Mag, dreamily, "it is but a little time at longest—the end
                     <emph>will</emph> full sure come at last; only a cowardly madness would shorten
                  it—would leap out of the present, even to my hereafter, with"——</p>
               <p>Her heart whispered the name: "Charles Atherton Moore."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Rivers, I had a pleasant dream once of becoming perfect. It is a sad thing to
                  know now that it was only a dream."</p>
               <p>"We ought to live to <emph>do</emph> good—if we <emph>do</emph> good we shall
                     <emph>be</emph> good."</p>
               <p>"Is that the highest aim in living—to <emph>do</emph> good?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly, what higher? Why, there is a <emph>world to save.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"I am afraid it will be beyond your power to save it." There was a bitter sneer
                  but half concealed in Mag's response.</p>
               <p>"Christ's command to his disciples was, '<emph>be ye also perfect.</emph>' And oh,
                  Mr. Rivers, how few of those who are so eager to reform the <emph>world,</emph>
                  think to commence the work in their own hearts. I would not trust a minister of
                  God, or one of God's so-called people, one instant sooner for their so-called
                  Christianity. I know men who are really flattering themselves that they are doing
                  God service, and 'saving the world,' because they profess to live to
                     <emph>do</emph> good. I know these men are doing most cruel wrong. If they
                  would only take for their standard Christ's command, '<emph>be ye perfect,</emph>'
                  they would neither violate their neighbor's rights nor their own nobility." Mag
                  shuddered as she added: "Henceforth, I shall trust neither man nor God, for both
                  have failed me. I shall trust <emph>myself first,</emph> and <emph>God</emph>
                  AFTER <emph>self!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Where did you study theology, Miss Barclay?"</p>
               <p>"Somewhat of the young ministers who have been preaching as candidates since Mr.
                  Brown concluded to take a higher sphere."</p>
               <p>"What lessons did you learn from them?"</p>
               <p>"Much that made me sorrowful for the world they have gone to save, they were so
                  innocent of all knowledge of the world's wants, as well as the wants of their own
                  natures."</p>
               <p>"Do you ever read Parker, Martineau, Channing, Carlyle, Emerson, Newman, and the
                     <emph>liberal</emph> minded?"</p>
               <p>"Not long ago I asked a <emph>star</emph>-member of the senior class, at Andover
                  Theological School, if he ever read Carlyle or Emerson. He replied, 'No, indeed;
                  it was <emph>against his principles</emph> to read <emph>infidel</emph> works.' I
                  asked him how he knew they were <emph>infidel,</emph> if he never read them? He
                  replied that he had seen one or two religious <emph>reviews</emph> that called
                  them so, and none of the <emph>ministers</emph> ever read them."</p>
               <p>"Tell it not in Gath, lest the uncircumcised triumph."</p>
               <p>"Emerson, he supposed, was a 'light, fancy writer'—I use his own words—and he only
                  read the <emph>thinkers</emph> of the age!"</p>
               <p>"Publish it not in the streets of Askelon! Of course you are jesting!"</p>
               <p>"I wish it were only a jest! I should have more hope for the world he is trying to
                     <emph>save.</emph> Ik Marvel was one of his favorite authors; also he was
                  reading De Quincey."</p>
               <p>"They would not <emph>harm</emph> him."</p>
               <p>"Another member of that same senior class told me in confidence, as if it were a
                  dangerous secret that he was unfolding, 'he <emph>supposed</emph> there was a
                  great deal of skepticism in Germany; indeed, that an <emph>intimate friend</emph>
                  of his was <emph>thinking</emph> of studying up on German infidelity, so that he
                  might be prepared to <emph>answer it</emph> BEFORE <emph>it reached
                     America!</emph>'"</p>
               <p>"Such men as Professors Parks, Shedd and Phelps must be proud of their
                  disciples."</p>
               <p>"These men were going forth, anxious to <emph>save the world!</emph> One of them
                  told me that ministers would serve God and man best by explaining the <emph>simple
                     truths</emph> of the Bible. I confessed to him I had found them beyond my
                  comprehension"——</p>
               <p>"And he failed to explain them to your comprehension."</p>
               <pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC6426-00000146"/>
               <p>"'Men would serve God best by leaving skepticism to take care of itself, with the
                     <emph>fools</emph> who believed there was no God,' he said."</p>
               <p>"A physician then should only study the common disorders that afflict humanity,
                  leaving uncommon disorders to take the chances—though skepticism is now a very
                  common disease, as I chance to know."</p>
               <p>"One <emph>graduate</emph> of Andover believed it common—told me that in <emph>his
                     opinion</emph> Prof. Parks himself was a skeptic, only he was too politic to
                  own it. That young man acknowledged, however, for his own part, that he
                     <emph>preached</emph> good things to his people, he hoped <emph>they</emph>
                  would <emph>practise</emph> them—it was none of their business whether
                     <emph>he</emph> practised his own preaching or not!"</p>
               <p>"He was <emph>frank!</emph> Are you in earnest, Miss Barclay?"</p>
               <p>"I mean exactly what I say. Three <emph>popular</emph> theological students, who
                  had gone out to <emph>save the world,</emph> had that much knowledge of the way in
                  which it ought to be done. I could not help pitying the unfortunate world that was
                  depending upon their help for its salvation. But the subject sickens me; it is too
                  hopeless."</p>
               <p>"You are talking in quite a masculine fashion."</p>
               <p>"Don't tell me so. I shall endeavor to become a perfect Josephine—all gentleness,
                  grace, submission, sacrifice, fascination, womanliness."</p>
               <p>"I could never love you otherwise, at least. A woman who plays the masculine is a
                  repulsive object."</p>
               <p>"She must never be a wooer; never bold, daring, saucy?"</p>
               <p>"Never, if I am to be won."</p>
               <p>"Now, most adorable sir," thought Mag, "it will be very amusing to me to try you
                  on that! No harm in making myself repulsive. It is my private opinion that the
                  future Mrs. Rivers—she is in existence somewhere even now—is a very masculine
                  woman, and capable of 'wearing the—unmentionables,' as Frank says." And a great
                  gush of something choked her at thought of Frank.</p>
               <p>And in the course of time and conversation they reached Min's home—a large country
                  mansion—and were received by Min, Hudson Ely and friends. The doomed pair seemed
                  approaching the inevitable with commendable resignation—even serenity.</p>
               <p>The <emph>event</emph> of the evening came off at last, amid a crowd of the élite
                  from miles and miles around.</p>
               <p>After all it is a solemn thing for two young souls to stand before the man of God,
                  and hear the words: "In the presence of God, his holy angels, and these witnesses,
                  I pronounce you husband and wife, and what <emph>God hath joined together</emph>
                  let not man put asunder."</p>
               <p>There must be many joined together who are not joined of God.</p>
               <p>After the hush, all begin to breathe again; belles begin to laugh and simper;
                  grave, elderly gentlemen begin to discuss politics; and grave, elderly ladies
                  discuss scandal; the literary cluster in groups and discuss books and men, and
                  students discuss women.</p>
               <p>Amid all, the merry move as vitalizing elements; and thus moved Min, and Mag
                  Barclay, and May Burton, as the bright particular stars of the evening. Min's
                  merry humor subdued into a genial glow, May's quaint wit darting keen-pointed, and
                  Mag's wild spirits rising into a reckless storm; being mad with unrest from the
                  new experience that had poisoned her faith.</p>
               <p>She stood the centre of a group, trying her powers at one and the same time, on a
                  theologian, a middle-aged statesman, and our friend Mason Rivers—all of whom were
                  bandying flattery, as <emph>wise</emph> men always do with women.</p>
               <p>"Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon
                  them," quoth the statesman. "Your sympathies are with the last, Miss Barclay."</p>
               <p>"Vide Shakspeare, left hand page. Do you remember the precise chapter and verse,
                  Dr. Barker?"</p>
               <p>Dr. Barker smiled, and replied with another quotation: <q>
                     <l>"Once on a time, old Johnny Bull flew in a rage of fury."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"The point to that last remark is so keen it goes through bone and marrow, and
                  comes out on the reverse side. What an insight one has of human nature, when a
                  wise man shows such penetration with his weapons of wit."</p>
               <p>"One needs to use nonsense in self-defence, when dealing with a sarcastic
                  coquette."</p>
               <p>"Was the last arrow pointed at her? By the by, as a benevolent physician of souls,
                  could he not give her some rules for managing mankind? She was trying to
                     <emph>post</emph> herself, and he, a statesman, having learned all the secrets
                  of wire-pulling, could give her invaluable information."</p>
               <pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC6426-00000147"/>
               <p>"He never would give her one item of information; she was too wise already—a
                  dangerous person anyhow—a female Talleyrand!"</p>
               <p>"Any creature under heaven but Talleyrand. The <emph>rule of contraries</emph> was
                  the only rule she found practicable. As far as she was able to judge—which was not
                  far, on account of youth and inexperience—the rule, if reduced to a science, would
                  be the perfection of policy. Never believe a man's sentiments to be other than the
                  opposite of those he expresses—that is, if a man really is sufficiently advanced
                  in the development theory, from monkeydom, to be sure that he has an opinion of
                  his own. Would he please be good and enlighten her a little on the world policy,
                  of which she was so dangerously ignorant?"</p>
               <p>"Ladies had no business with world-knowledge—it was dangerous—a bad world—and
                  knowledge of evil was not good for ladies—they should be shielded from it. Where
                  ignorance was bliss, etc."</p>
               <p>"But she was aiming for the Presidency. The country was getting in a desperate
                  condition; somebody ought to reform affairs, and she had been lately impressed
                  with the sublime ignorance of mankind; she was preparing for an emergency; was
                  more than anxious to obtain power over men."</p>
               <p>"He did not <emph>doubt it!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"By the by, she felt appreciated in those five words of his; usually whenever she
                  wished to make her remarks incomprehensible, she spoke the naked truth, and found
                  it the most impenetrable of all disguises. He had understood her—penetrated her
                  mask."</p>
               <p>"She must wear armor if she dare be so severe."</p>
               <p>"Yes, she wore scale-armor, and came off unscathed, even when carrying the war
                  into the heart of the enemy's camp. But sometimes she found that in dealing with
                  fools, other weapons than reason, wit, or intellect were necessary; for herself,
                  she never used pistols except in sport, but once."</p>
               <p>"Would she enlighten him?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly; with every possible item of information in her power, hoping to
                  benefit him; she had no objection to being useful; it was her profession to impart
                  knowledge to all who wished for what she had to give. Emerson had taught her to
                  'show frankly as a saint would do, all her <emph>experience, methods, tools, and
                     means,</emph> to learn higher secrets of her own nature.' She had an experience
                  which she would reveal to him for a consideration."</p>
               <p>"What on earth was she living for? What did she want now?"</p>
               <p>"Money, money, money—the root of all evil; there were radicals of all manner of
                  evils in her personality, and now what she wanted was to transplant some of the
                  root of evil into her purse."</p>
               <p>"When there was a will there was a way."</p>
               <p>"Yes, and she had made astonishing exertions to find the way."</p>
               <p>"He was curious to know some of them."</p>
               <p>"Well, for one, she had written a book."</p>
               <p>"But that did not astonish him. Had she published it?"</p>
               <p>"Not she, for reasons too numerous to mention. It went overboard without meeting
                  even the eye of a publisher—the MS. lost, and 'thereby hung a tale' which could
                  not interest a statesman, as the book was not written on politics."</p>
               <p>"But it would interest him; he was more interested than she could dream."</p>
               <p>"Then she should certainly unfold the tale to him only when she made him her
                  'father confessor;' it should be at a private confessional, and she should
                     <emph>charge</emph> the father the fee, instead of paying for the
                  confession."</p>
               <p>"Only name her price for the secret."</p>
               <p>"She was engaged then; she would do so at a convenient season." And taking the arm
                  of Mason Rivers, she smiled back "Au revoir" to Dr. Barker. Mindful of Mason
                  Rivers' sentiments concerning the strong-minded, she endeavored to
                     <emph>repel</emph> him by some very "strong" advances. They returned to the
                  statesman at last.</p>
               <p>"Do you not think us an admirable couple?" she asked him, leaning gracefully upon
                  the arm of the artist.</p>
               <p>"The 'tout ensemble' is perfect," he replied. "White arm, with delicate festoons
                  of drapery knotted with green leaves, rounded neck and elegant bust; head with a
                  coronal of brown braids, interwoven with white chenille, dimpled mouth, deep, dark
                  eyes, full of a strange, piercing, mocking, sardonic light. What do those eyes
                  mean? parted lips, also with a sardonic smile that hovers around the pearls.
                  Explain it."</p>
               <p>"I have been persuading this young man to have the ceremony performed immediately.
                  I tell him there is no<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC6426-00000148"/> time like the
                  present. He is modest and bashful, poor fellow, and afraid to face the music. Can
                  you relieve him?"</p>
               <p>"I would advise him to fear the consequences. He could never manage you."</p>
               <p>"I shall never require it of him; I shall always take the responsibility of
                  managing myself and him, too. You are authorized to tie the knot; please do it in
                  a hurry, I am impatient!"</p>
               <p>He commenced the marriage ceremony.</p>
               <p>Now, if any one thinks that a man like Mason Rivers, who is perfectly sound in
                     <emph>theory</emph> on the woman question, will not outrage his theory by
                  practice, under temptation, particularly when the temptation is a specimen of
                  strongminded female flesh and blood, placed so near his heart as to set every
                  nerve delirious; why such a one does not comprehend the weakness of masculine
                  flesh and blood.</p>
               <p>The question was propounded: "Wilt thou take this woman?" etc.</p>
               <p>"<emph>I will,</emph>" was the grave response.</p>
               <p>"And wilt thou take this man?" etc.</p>
               <p>"That I will!" responded Mag.</p>
               <p>"Then, by the authority vested in me, I pronounce you"——</p>
               <p>"Man and woman," said Mag.</p>
               <p>"Husband and wife," continued Dr. Barker. "And now that you have married in haste,
                  you may repent at leisure. I am fully authorized to do this sort of work, and it
                  is binding, if you say so."</p>
               <p>"Well, I hope you feel submissive," said Mag to <emph>the</emph> half. "You will
                  remember that as I have done the business, it will be <emph>your</emph> duty to
                     <emph>obey,</emph> not mine."</p>
               <p>"He seems perfectly submissive," said the statesman.</p>
               <p>"And now we must go and congratulate ourselves on our happy union. I will
                  electioneer for the felicitations."</p>
               <p>And they took a meteoric orbit through the rooms.</p>
               <p>"It is considered bad taste for a young-married couple to be too attentive," said
                  Mag; "I see those belles are eating out their hearts for envy of me. I shall be
                  magnanimous, and permit you to bestow any amount of sweetness upon them without
                  being jealous."</p>
               <p>Mag returned to Dr. Barker.</p>
               <p>"Are you ready for the confessional?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"Waiting and anxious for the <emph>fee.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"You shall have carte blanche."</p>
               <p>"I want your <emph>vote</emph> for the Presidency."</p>
               <p>"I will vote for you every time, and my wife will do it also."</p>
               <p>"The idea is here; those people in Congress quarrel like a set of untrained
                  school-boys, who have not been sufficiently whipped; and the more they quarrel,
                  the worse affairs get; and it is getting to be a burning pity that some good
                  schoolmaster like Louis Napoleon will not take their case in hand, with a rod of
                  iron. Do you suppose Douglas can do it? Emperor, you know."</p>
               <p>"There is method in your madness."</p>
               <p>"What the consequences will be no one can foretell, but something ought to bring
                  people to their senses. I chance to know three members of the last State
                  Legislature, and not one of the three was able to write a line, without
                  misspelling some of the words. If those three men ever comprehended the meaning of
                  the word <emph>politics,</emph> they learned it after the session of the
                  legislature, and it is my opinion that it was a long way past their comprehension
                  then. And thirteen members of the last Legislature of Texas were 'men of
                  mark'—that is, could neither read nor write—could give their signatures only by
                  using their mark."</p>
               <p>"There are gleams of truth in your insanity. Out of two hundred and thirty-four
                  members of our State Legislature, two hundred were mere <emph>voting</emph>
                  members, mere cyphers, otherwise. Can I do anything else for you—help you on your
                  book?"</p>
               <p>"You can help me solve the life-problem."</p>
               <p>"State it, if you please."</p>
               <p>"Given—a woman nearly twenty, with a sound mind in a sound body—some call her
                  talents genius, and some insanity—to work out a successful destiny
                     <emph>alone.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"It cannot be done, unless she can write a book."</p>
               <p>"That is a cruel truth; I must solve the problem by writing the book. You shall
                  help me."</p>
               <p>"I will help you with head and heart. God never intended that woman should work
                     <emph>alone.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Then his <emph>intentions</emph> are woefully frustrated on earth. What kind of a
                  book must I write?"</p>
               <p>"Write just what life has taught you! Never undertake to write what you <emph>do
                     not know,</emph> you will confuse your own ideas, and the ideas of every one
                  who tries to read you, otherwise. What was the subject of the one that was
                  shattered?"</p>
               <pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC6426-00000149"/>
               <p>"Skepticism—I had gone into that slough, and <emph>knew</emph> it thoroughly; my
                  book was written to sympathize with others in the Despond."</p>
               <p>"Give me the particulars of that book wreck."</p>
               <p>"It is a cruel subject, but you must have it."</p>
               <p>Mag hesitated, and finally continued in her hap-hazard way.</p>
               <p>"I was ashamed of my presumption in writing it, as I am ashamed to own my sin to
                  my confessor now—and only do it for the <emph>fee.</emph> I never hinted to my
                  nearest friend that I had written it, did not choose to permit my friends to know
                  of any <emph>failure</emph> of mine. By the by, writing a book is a good style of
                  education, it teaches one to think. I was obliged to read up on the documents, as
                  well as talk, to be able to write on skepticism."</p>
               <p>"I will put a pin in there: Useful item for schools—Pupils write books."</p>
               <p>"Having learned that absolutely I was obliged to work out the life-problem
                     <emph>alone,</emph> I went about it; taking those Bible-promises for my
                  help—you remember them all, 'In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He will
                     <emph>direct</emph> thy paths,' 'Ask and ye <emph>shall</emph> receive,' 'Not a
                  sparrow falls to the ground without Him, and even the hairs of your head are all
                  numbered.' God has promised to be <emph>Father</emph> to the fatherless, and if
                  that means any one, it means <emph>me.</emph> Well, I appropriated all those
                  promises—thinking that if the Bible on Faith meant anything, it meant precisely
                  what it said. If we have faith like a grain of mustard-seed, it should remove
                  mountains into the sea. I would <emph>test</emph> that faith. I would
                     <emph>do</emph> God's will. Dr. Bushnell says, that when in our life-destiny,
                  the Natural is not sufficient for our need, the Supernatural will come to the
                  rescue. I believed, too, that 'Faith without works was dead.' There was no other
                  way left me to believe in God, but to test those promises, and I did it, or rather
                  I am doing it still, for if I fail <emph>entirely,</emph> my faith goes to the
                     bottomless—<emph>all is lost!</emph> Hope for this world, and for that which is
                  to come—and I have a grand interest laid up in that Hereafter, and do not wish to
                  lose it—great love laid up there—father, mother, Frank. And when I am first a
                  bride, it will be in the better country, you know."</p>
               <p>"How do I know?"</p>
               <p>"Take my word for it."</p>
               <p>"Ahem!"</p>
               <p>"Three months ago, Min and myself visited her sister, Mrs. Everett Walton of
                  Hartford, to prepare ourselves on fashions for this present interesting occasion,
                  and while our hearts were with dress, my head was filled with the book problem.
                  Somebody—a stranger—must help me on my book. I wanted literary criticism. I would
                  not risk my reputation on what I had written—I was not satisfied with it, and one
                  cannot judge of what one writes oneself, you know."</p>
               <p>"I know."</p>
               <p>"Everett Walton introduced me to an elderly gentleman friend of his, with whom he
                  was very intimate, and recommended him strongly to my good graces, as being an
                  unusually benevolent, active member of the church—wonderfully zealous in those
                  great revival meetings—bosom friend of one of the most distinguished revival
                  ministers—also had been member of the City Council, sheriff, and mayor, and—you
                  understand—a married man, with children grown."</p>
               <p>"I understand."</p>
               <p>"We attended some of those astonishing revival meetings—and my patron was
                  unwearied in his efforts for sinners—among other sinners, your humble servant, who
                  sung her best on the hallelujah hymns; and on the way home, he inquired very
                  earnestly if there was no possible way for Miss Barclay's invaluable society to be
                  procured for the benefit of the city of Hartford; and Miss Barclay, thinking that
                  a special providence had opened the way for her, told the gentleman that she had
                  written a book."</p>
               <p>"Method in the madness, as usual."</p>
               <p>"I presume he saw the madness, without having your discernment of the method
                  therein—judging from his course. I made a blunder someway at least; whether it was
                  arrogance in me to say that I would test God's promises; whether the fault was in
                  the prayers to Our Father—my heart was full, and overflowing with them, day and
                  night; nearly every breath was a prayer then, and my very life, I thought, hung on
                  the prayer; whether it was faith or works that went awry, I cannot say, not being
                  an impartial judge of my own exploits. Human nature is weak, but my theory was
                  that faith was given for the perfection of <emph>imperfect</emph> natures—but, Dr.
                  Barker, you see, it is almost impossible to tell you the result."</p>
               <p>"Go on, Mag, <emph>please.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"So I took the MS. to him, at the United States Hotel—having, as a last thing
                  before I started, knelt down and<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC6426-00000150"/> asked
                  God again to direct me, and thanking Him fervently for opening the way before me.
                  I gave him the package, on which I had spent the work of all my years; told him it
                  needed criticism; he was acquainted with literary men, he said, his friends; they
                  should tell him its faults, and he would report the criticism to me—it would be
                  invaluable."</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"And then he told me, with an emphasis, that he loved me madly—that I had capsized
                  him completely—I had stultified him—and he had come to see me, then and there, to
                  tell me so! Would I pray for him? Was it not a providential thing that we had
                  met!</p>
               <p>"I looked at the gentleman, thunderstruck. He was a splendid specimen of the
                  physical man. You saw Charles Moore—he was his exact counterpart, only his eye
                  never met mine, it avoided me—it was beautiful, too, and so was the silver in his
                  curls."</p>
               <p>"All providential!"</p>
               <p>"I had flattered myself that a special providence had sent me to him in answer to
                  all my burning prayers, and at last I told him so; and told him, too, that I would
                  forgive his insult, and I would pray for him, and I would leave the MS. with him
                  still, and permit him to redeem himself by doing me the good I needed."</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"And I have never seen that MS. since. I sent for it, once, twice, thrice, four
                  times. The last time, my messenger said, on his return, that the gentleman, with
                  cool contempt, informed him that it was lost, and he couldn't find it for the
                  lady, and he might tell her so."</p>
               <p>"Yes. What then?"</p>
               <p>"Much that can never be told. I concluded, for one thing, that Providence had
                  mocked me. That was no manner of answer to a prayer, that I considered
                  satisfactory. There was a fault somewhere. If I had trusted God too much, I would
                  be sure and <emph>trust myself</emph> more in future. I would remedy that defect
                  soon. So I commenced my old practice of pistol-shooting. Had a grand time, too. I
                  did not feel disposed to lose the manuscript. I had spent too much on it, and
                  could not <emph>afford</emph> to lose it, I thought. I was fully resolved to find
                  the way to the gentleman's heart; if I could not do it in one way, I would be sure
                  to do it in another. I was desperately tired of life, anyhow; did not believe in
                  God; longed to see Frank, it seemed to me, as no human being ever longed for a
                  loved one before. If he had 'gone to the bad,' I wanted to go, too—and as soon as
                  possible. I concluded I would send one ball through the hypocrite's heart,—not
                  that I fancied his company into the other world either—and I would send another
                  ball through my own."</p>
               <p>"It seems you did not do it, or I should have seen an account of it in the
                  newspapers. What a plum they missed!"</p>
               <p>"Yes; I thought of that, too, as I took the carriage for his office; and I thought
                  of his wife and children, and of the church that would miss his efforts for the
                  conversion of sinners. I thought of it all, when I called him out to the carriage,
                  and told him I must trouble him to find the MS. for me, as it was essential that I
                  should have it."</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"He was as bland as a June morning, if I could only have caught the sunshine of
                  his magnificent eye. 'He regretted exceedingly that the thing was lost; he would
                  be sure to find it for me—told me that I was as beautiful as ever, and he had the
                  same burning love for me.'——</p>
               <p>"And I stopped him right then and there, and told him he was a fiendish
                     <emph>liar,</emph> and God knew I would shoot him down in the streets if I
                  heard any more language of that kind from him; but as he had lost the MS., he must
                  give me the criticisms on it immediately. It was necessary for me that I should
                  have them.</p>
               <p>"'Yes,' he said, 'he had showed the thing to a friend of his—a
                     <emph>student</emph> of Yale College (!) for criticism—fine fellow, friend of
                  his—who said there were fine things in the book, but its pro-slavery sentiments
                  would damn the book.' There was not a line about slavery in the book. 'He himself
                  was pro-slavery—ran on the pro-slavery ticket for office, and was defeated. There
                  was not enough of incident or novelty in the plot of the book to suit the popular
                  taste; the masses in the streets were only interested in some horrible tragedy.'
                  By the by, Dr. Barker, I have a conpassion for that same popular taste.—I wonder
                  if it would suit the legislature to listen to a blood and thunder slave
                  story."</p>
               <p>"Finish your story."</p>
               <p>"I stopped him with a laugh. I could not help it for the life of me; it was too
                  ridiculous. Providence or no Providence, I told him that he would never
                  distinguish himself for logic; his remarks were not to the point, etc., etc. I
                  would thank him to send the manuscript to me by the next<pb n="300-301"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000151"/> express, which he promised to do, and never did,
                  and so my book went overboard. I found out that, unfortunately, the man, like my
                  three friends of the legislature, was unable to spell, and I concluded, on the
                  whole, that it would be casting my pearls before swine to shoot myself for him,
                  and I should prefer better company to Hades; was afraid we should quarrel while
                  Charon was rowing us over the Styx, and so I would not do it. I would do better:
                  try again on the book, and stake my religion on its success; be a little more
                  cautious about my helpers."</p>
               <p>"So you have come to me."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," said Mag, laughing; "and you understand, that if you play me false, I
                  consider you fair and good and worthy game for shooting! I should have no scruples
                  about shooting you down. I could hate you, because you are strong, and can be
                  noble. I never could condescend to hate an insignificant soul."</p>
               <p>"I am at your service, Mag; make what use of me you will. Don't shoot me till you
                  have tested me."</p>
               <p>"Thank you kindly! When my book is rewritten I shall send it to you as its
                  guardian. It will not be done soon; for I hope my <emph>faith</emph> will revisit
                  me. Every page must be written with a prayer, for my religion fails with the book.
                  I am busy in school now; heart and brain are full. It is my life-problem, you
                  know. I shall do my best now, and be cautious, too."</p>
               <p>"The devil seems to have answered that prayer of yours, and God to have had no
                  part in it. Your spirit has gone mad over it, and that is wrong. I believe your
                  prayers will all be answered yet. It <emph>must</emph> be so. You will work out
                  the life-problem successfully, Mag, do not doubt it!"</p>
               <p>"Unless the Bible is a lie, God must bring good even out of that pollution, Dr.
                  Barker. I speak reverently now. I had most <emph>implicit faith. Simple
                     faith,</emph> they tell us, is all-powerful. Mine was <emph>simple</emph>
                  enough, perhaps; but I <emph>know it was</emph> TRUE! God knows, it was true,
                  while it lasted. If the Bible is true, and that faith was true, then that prayer
                  is obliged to be answered yet."</p>
               <p>"To <emph>doubt</emph> it would be sin, and you have sinned in your bitter doubt
                  to-night."</p>
               <p>Mag went on her way with less of desperation, yet a skeptic still; for she could
                  not see <emph>why</emph> these things were so.</p>
               <p>It was a glorious moonlight night. During the ride home Mason Rivers was unsaying
                  every word he had said in going.</p>
               <p>With Mag it required a tremendous effort of the will to listen to his words, much
                  more to parry the pointed sentiments he was bestowing freely. A tragedy was going
                  on in her heart and brain, of which her flirting and coquetting were the
                  side-scenes.</p>
               <p>"It should be no fault of his," Rivers said, "if their marriage in jest did not
                  become one in earnest, and a happy one."</p>
               <p>"Our sentiments on the woman question are so entirely dissimilar!" Mag replied.
                  "You consider it an indispensable requisite that <emph>you</emph> should put all
                  the preliminary questions yourself. When I marry in earnest, I shall ask my
                  beloved the fated questions; he must never ask them of me. I shall never say 'yes'
                  to a man who asks me."</p>
               <p>"You will confer an inexpressible favor, Miss Barclay, by asking me the questions
                     <emph>now.</emph> I am more than anxious to answer them. There is no time like
                  the present time. My answer is waiting. It shall be 'yes,' and thank you
                  kindly."</p>
               <p>"I am not going to ask the questions yet," she answered. "I am not prepared; I
                  must wait some months, to impress upon your mind a sense of my discretion. I pride
                  myself on my discretion, and you must see it in its perfection."</p>
               <p>"Your course this evening has convinced me past a doubt."</p>
               <p>"Well, I must convince myself of your perfections in the same line, before I
                  venture; so we <emph>must</emph> possess our souls with patience, whether we wish
                  or not."</p>
               <p>They reached home at last. Mag bounded up to her room, threw off her hat and
                  shawl, and surveyed herself in the mirror. It was the same figure that had stood
                  before Dr. Barker, but she was not sure of her identity; her spirit seemed
                  disembodied, standing beside its fleshy tenement, that seemed changed to painted
                  stone. Was that, indeed, the creature that God and man recognized as Magdalene
                  Barclay? That <emph>unwomanly</emph> thing? How she hated herself! That thing
                  might be put into hat and boots! She smiled at the conceit—placed the idea before
                  her on its feet—surveyed it—turned it topsy-turvy, and took its bearings—whirled
                  it on its head—then pitched it flat—for somehow her own head was giddy and sick.
                  She must put it to other business than going insane, indeed she positively
                     could<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC6426-00000152"/> not afford either to get sick
                  or go insane, because she had no one who loved her, to take care of her, under
                  those peculiar circumstances. Ergo, she resolved neither to get sick nor go
                  insane—a strong will would prevent either; she would write poetry first—and she
                  did.</p>

                  unanswered letter. She said that she had discovered that the sister arts of wooing
                  and winning were by no means confined to the sterner sex—that ladies, too, like
                  Goethe, might study as a part of self-culture, the art of extracting their rarest
                  secrets from human hearts—and so on, ad infinitum.</p>
               <p>Months afterward the letter reached Charles Moore, on his return from the Orient,
                  at Smyrna. He was on his way home to his native land, but he turned from it again
                  in disgust, as if that land was haunted by pestilence. He went trampling the old
                  earth over again, to crush down the intense bitterness in his soul.</p>
               <p>He answered the letter.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Magdalene Barclay! For me only should have been the immolation of the wild
                  virginity of your spirit! The pure bud of promise in your rare girlhood has
                  blossomed into diseased life; not by God's sunlight of love, but by kindling
                  baleful passion fires! My peerless rose—my bright New England flower—is polluted,
                     <emph>worthless.</emph> God help me! God help us both! I would have received
                  your spirit in its immaculate innocence; and had I, by some 'bloody blunder,'
                  stained its purity, by all laws, human and divine, I would have torn out my own
                  heart to atone for the wrong! Oh, Magdalene Barclay! you have wrought out your own
                  curse! thrown yourself into the abyss! God help us, for you have dragged me down
                  with you!"</p>
               <p>Thus he wrote; the letter was received by her all too soon. It was never answered.
                  He gave no address for a reply.</p>

               <head>XXIV. CHANGE OF SCENE—FATE OF A BAND-BOX.</head>
               <p>"THIS life is absolutely intolerable, Miss Barclay," said Mag to herself, as the
                  winter months rolled away. "Your heart has at last become that empty millstone,
                  which having nothing else to feed upon, is grinding itself away. The <emph>worst
                     possible</emph> has come! Everything other than this must be better. Penniless,
                  friendless, loveless, what can you fear more? You are at bay with the world. Life
                  thus far a perfect failure! You have no <emph>hope</emph> for the future, but you
                  must live on and work on, and the energy of desperation is more powerful than even
                  hope. With hope there is <emph>fear</emph> of loss, and hope unnerves one; but
                  with you all is lost;<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC6426-00000153"/> every step you
                  take now will be forward; there can be no lower depths to the abyss. You must
                  leave these hills and mountains, which are haunted by memories of Frank, who has
                  left you, and of Charles Moore, who has not only turned traitor to you, but to
                  himself—yes, betrayed himself, given himself up to the earthly instead of
                  worshipping the divine. You could have borne anything but that! Yes, this life is
                  unendurable! You are now a <emph>slave</emph> to circumstances; but you must force
                  circumstances to your will, in some degree. We <emph>are</emph> the framers of our
                  own destinies. The heart <emph>is</emph> its own fate; and you too can
                     <emph>dare</emph> Fate now to do her worst, and smile as she tramples upon you.
                  Let her do her utter worst, she can never wring another tear from you. You shall
                  find some new slavery at her hands, that will help you to <emph>forget</emph>
                  yourself. Fate <emph>shall</emph> bend somewhat to your will, or that fierce
                  spirit of yours will do the flesh a deadly harm."</p>
               <p>To resolve with energy, was to act with energy. Mag wrote North, South, East, and
                  West, to every acquaintance she had, applying for a situation as teacher—the only
                  employment open for a woman. At last she received a response from eastern
                  Mississippi. Her services were desired as principal of the Female Department of a
                  new Institution, "Clarke Co. Male and Female Institute," Mr. Church, the principal
                  of the Male Department, wrote that he was glad to hear, that besides taking charge
                  of the Literary Department, she was somewhat qualified to teach music and
                  painting, as in an emergency, she would be able to assist the professors in the
                  department of the Arts.</p>
               <p>A few months were given Mag for preparation; she accepted the terms, closed up her
                  administration in the Academy at Glenlyn, and made ready for a change of scene.
                  She devoted herself especially to the fine arts. Hudson Ely invited her to become
                  an inmate of his home in New Haven. Through the kindness of Dr. Barker, she was
                  received into the studio of a New York artist, who was painting the portraits of
                  distinguished residents of New Haven at that time. So she was domesticated with
                  Min, a student of Art under Mr. Sawyer, and music pupil of Mr. Burnett. May Burton
                  entered an Institute at New Haven at the time, and so her blessings brightened as
                  they took their flight. With friends around her, she almost forgot the wild pain
                  in her heart—kindness was soothing; and the long talks on art, and the study of
                  the beautiful, magnetized her restless spirit—the hardening heart melted. One
                  day—one strange day—she remembered it for years—the fountains in that stony heart
                  were unsealed, and sweet, human tears came gushing like rain-drops in springtime.
                  They fell back in showers and watered the dry, burning, stony heart. For years
                  afterward, her sweetest dream of heaven was to sleep—to awake in the embraces of
                  one who loved and pitied her, and to <emph>sob</emph> her pain away. The next
                  tears she shed were upon the heart of one who loved her well, and pitied her with
                  a great, yearning, solemn pity; but long years rolled away before she shed those
                  tears.</p>
               <p>She was copying a child's portrait—a bright, sweet face, with dimpled mouth and
                  shoulders, and sunny curls; she named it her "Art-baby," and called it Charlie,
                  because she loved it, and because it was its name. She was mingling tints for the
                  cloud drapery around the shoulders, when her heart melted so miraculously into
                  tears; when the tears had passed away, and the rainbow that accompanied them, Mr.
                  Burritt, whose portrait the artist was painting, entered with a lady.</p>
               <p>The lady looked at the work on Mag's easel.</p>
               <p>"You have portraits of <emph>twins,</emph>" said she to the artist, not
                  comprehending Mag's part of the performance.</p>
               <p>"There is a genuine compliment for you, Miss Barclay," said Mr. Burritt, whose
                  heart was large enough to encourage all effort that came under his observation.
                  His congratulations came with such genial, whole-souled sympathy, that Mag's heart
                  rose with a glad bound, and woman-like, because he had flattered her, she forever
                  afterward insisted that Elihu Burritt had a great, warm heart, a noble generous
                  heart, and that was true.</p>
               <p>He has a heart full of magnanimous love for the sorrowful and down-pressed—for the
                  black slaves of the sunny South, and the white slaves of the rugged North, and the
                  hordes of slaves to passion and sin and want, that throng the old earth. Because
                  there was a great, earnest heart beating for humanity in his bosom, he went over
                  the ocean on his mission of universal peace, and unfolded it to mother England;
                  and because of that warm, true, loving heart he is striving so earnestly to be the
                  slave's friend and emancipator.</p>
               <p>Elihu Burritt, the learned blacksmith—the friend of peace. A son of New England
                  claims it as his right to victimize the man of the people even in this book. If it
                  is wrong, we<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC6426-00000154"/> beg his pardon. Our
                  apology is, that Burritt is a man of the nation, born in New England; whom New
                  England is proud to honor.</p>
               <p>But we are wandering from our story.</p>
               <p>From that day, at Mr. Burritt's request, Mag stayed at her easel while he was
                  sitting for his portrait; and her master requested her to exert herself to rouse
                  the <emph>expressions</emph> in his face, while he was giving the finishing
                  touches to the picture. She had the audacity to try some of her powers in calling
                  out the strange, variable piercing light in his dark blue eye, which it was so
                  difficult to transfer to the canvas.</p>
               <p>"The expression of your eye has a dangerous cork-screw turn that is very difficult
                  to interpret, sir! What a wiry soul must be at home in the remote regions, that
                  you do not permit the profane to enter! And what a curious trick you teach it of
                  looking out upon souls not of its kind!"</p>
               <p>It was a piece of saucy daring in Mag; and she watched the eye and face to see
                  what expressions her remark would call forth. There was a bright, merry, flash of
                  surprise, and a quick, keen glance, that did not petrify her; but did encourage
                  her to be more daring still—to question him eagerly of all the notabilities of the
                  old world whom he had known as friends. For an hour she poured out an incessant
                  volley of questions.</p>
               <p>"How came you to know all those old German theologians?" he asked her at length,
                  having patiently answered all.</p>
               <p>"She had become acquainted with them all, in her dreams."</p>
               <p>Mag ran home at night, and told Min that "she had had <emph>two</emph> sugar-plums
                  in one day; she had miraculously accomplished a fit of weeping, and had talked
                  with the Learned Blacksmith."</p>
               <p>Her further remarks were interrupted by the entrance of one Richard Hudson Ely,
                  Esq., Judge of Probate, in a terrible panic.</p>
               <p>"Min, I have lost my Docket-book, and it is my opinion that you have hidden it in
                  some of your wonderful housekeeping apparatus. Do, for heaven's sake find it for
                  me, or I shall be ruined!"</p>
               <p>"Not I," said Min, composedly; "I have not seen a scrap of it."</p>
               <p>"You must have seen it somewhere; just think. A little black, doomsday book. I
                  have hunted the office high and low for it, and you have just lost it in some of
                  your pickling and preserving machinery, which jars on my feelings tremendously,
                  Mrs. Ely."</p>
               <p>The judge was in a fret.</p>
               <p>"I declare I haven't seen the first shadow of it," said Mrs. Ely.</p>
               <p>"It is no laughing matter, I'll assure you. All my cases for the next court, with
                  their order of appearance. You or Bridget must have misplaced it. You seem to
                  enjoy it!"</p>
               <p>"We are every one sober as the judge himself," said Min, putting on a solemn face.
                  For a mortal hour the worthies, with Bridget, spent their energies in searching
                  every nook and cranny, from garret to cellar, but the Docket-book did not make its
                  appearance, and Judge Richard Hudson Ely was in dismay.</p>
               <p>"It will be a fearful judgment day," said Min, laughing in spite of herself, at
                  his woe-begone visage. "Don't disturb your equanimity so frightfully! Do cool
                  yourself off and get comfortable, and I know you <emph>will feel
                  better.</emph>"</p>
               <p>A painful smile distorted his countenance.</p>
               <p>"You have kindled the fire with it, Mrs. Ely."</p>
               <p>"It must be the fire of your—<emph>disposition.</emph> Don't disturb your temper
                  over trouble, it makes it worse."</p>
               <p>And Min proceeded to take down every book in the secretary, and turn upside down
                  every document in the drawers.</p>
               <p>"What would you give for a sight of the Book of Doom?" said she, diving under a
                  package of papers, at a little black article, which she fished out. She darted
                  away, as she saw light breaking suddenly through the gloom overshadowing him, as
                  if he had been a criminal unexpectedly reprieved.</p>
               <p>"What penalty does he deserve, Mag, for so basely slandering my housekeeping
                  propensities?" She was flying over sofas and chairs, with the book safely out of
                  the judge's grasp.</p>
               <p>"Such intolerable impertinence deserves a merciless punishment. With what pitiless
                  torture he has disturbed the peace and repose of a happy family, for the last
                  hour."</p>
               <p>"Please, ma'am, I am so sorry! I won't <emph>never</emph> do so no more;
                     <emph>never!</emph>" said the judge.</p>
               <p>"You cannot be trusted, sir; you will lose it again yourself, and then with the
                  most reckless ingratitude slander<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC6426-00000155"/> my
                  talents for housekeeping. Mag Barclay! Mag Barclay! Take warning by my sad fate.
                  Never commit matrimony! Woman! thou long-suffering, much-enduring article of
                  flesh, blood and spirit!"</p>
               <p>As Min resignedly surrendered the book, a look of unspeakable satisfaction was
                  reflected from her lord's face into her sparkling physiognomy. When next Judge Ely
                  made his appearance, he presented his lady a fine edition of Miss Leslie's Cookery
                  Book.</p>
               <p>This life soon ended for Mag—all too soon—she was obliged to start on her journey.
                  She found Mr. Burritt in Mr. Sawyer's studio when she called to make her adieux.
                  They greeted her cordially.</p>
               <p>"I am sorry, sorry, sorry to know that a New England girl <emph>will</emph> go
                  South," said Mr. Burritt, advancing to meet her as she entered. "I cannot believe
                  your mission lies there, Miss Barclay. Those slaveholders will corrupt you. I
                  never knew a Yankee girl who went South, that did not come back tainted in
                  sentiment."</p>
               <p>"But Mr. Burritt, pardon me; your <emph>logic</emph> is bad. If
                     <emph>fuller</emph> knowledge and light concerning the details of a great evil,
                  must force conscientious Puritan-bred children to change or modify their
                  sentiments, would you have them <emph>avoid that knowledge?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"There is indeed a plausible look to your question," he replied, the genial soul
                  beaming from his benevolent face. "But really and in earnest, you
                     <emph>ought</emph> not to go South."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Ought</emph> is a great word, for even a great man to use," said Mag with a
                  quizzical look. "It is much easier to criticise a course of action, than to
                  improve upon it. I am more than anxious to do <emph>right.</emph> If you can
                  suggest an improvement in my plans, my mind shall be open to conviction."</p>
               <p>"You should go to Paris and study art."</p>
               <p>"It <emph>is</emph> a happy suggestion. I thank you for it. I promise now,
                  faithfully, to do it at my <emph>first</emph> opportunity, and <emph>not
                     before!</emph>"</p>
               <p>She received the benedictions of her masters, and went on her way.</p>
               <p>While waiting in his parlors hung with paintings, to say a "Good bye," to Mr.
                  Burnett, she became absorbed in the study of one of those beautiful engravings of
                  Christ crowned with thorns—"Ecce Homo." The look of appealing agony in the eye,
                  for her, had a strange charm. Her master put the picture in her hands, as a
                  parting gift; and that pictured Christ accompanied her in all her wanderings as a
                  precious thing, when she had lost all faith in the presence of the Divine Christ
                  with mortals, and when the Paraclete was not the Comforter to her.</p>
               <p>The new minister at Glenlyn was her escort to New York. He told her he had
                  business there; she knew his sole business was to do an act of Christian charity,
                  to an orphan who had been teacher to his children.</p>
               <p>It was a bright morning in March, when she bid Aunt Lina, Uncle Alph, and little
                  Cousin Harry a "Good morning." She assured them in parting, that she would do her
                  best never to break her neck, but if she was ever so fortunate she would endeavor
                  to let them hear the joyful news by the first opportunity. Uncle Alph's last
                  exhortation to her was to "Be <emph>good,</emph> and happy," which advice struck
                  her with a ludicrous emotion that she tried to swallow, but which went down with
                  difficulty. As Uncle Alph's <emph>disposition</emph> had been the great curse of
                  her own and Aunt Lina's lives, she was <emph>moved</emph> with a perception of his
                  talents in <emph>giving advice.</emph> She had no doubt that those four words of
                  advice had cost Uncle Alph, at least, a week of hard study, and for those
                  overwhelming exertions in <emph>her</emph> behalf, she could bestow no more
                  fitting thanks than eloquent <emph>silence.</emph> She resolved mentally, however,
                  to send Uncle Alph the first <emph>money</emph> she ever came in possession of, to
                  relieve his business misfortunes, she was convinced that it was the only thing
                  that could improve his temper or bring even a show of peace to the family.</p>
               <p>Uncle Alph, seeing the lady smile at his parting effort, felt that he was not
                     <emph>appreciated,</emph> and as she drove away with the minister, declared
                  that she was "one queer little animal, <emph>anyhow,</emph>" and perhaps she was.
                  Unfortunate Uncle Alph! In a year, he was in his grave.</p>
               <p>Mag was sick before she reached New York. She had a tremendous cold, which set her
                  head in a tremendous whirl; there was nothing to do, however, but laugh at the
                  dizziness, and say silly things, which she did very easily, under the foolish
                  circumstances.</p>
               <p>"What a charming <emph>prospect!</emph>" Mag exclaimed, with sudden admiration of
                     <emph>darkness visible,</emph> as the cars groaned and thundered slowly through
                  the tunnel near New York. She<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC6426-00000156"/> would
                  have enjoyed an earthquake just then, and had a hateful, insignificant feeling,
                  because she could not accomplish <emph>much</emph> more than a locomotive! She,
                  somehow, wanted to have something tear up those rocks over the tunnel, and it
                  fretted her, the thought that nothing <emph>could</emph> do it.</p>
               <p>"Your remark cannot be intended for 'eye'-rony," responded the new minister, in
                  amazement at her <emph>perceptions</emph> of the beautiful!</p>
               <p>"'I'ron'y' savors of 'ego'-tism, sir, and should never be permitted to slip in,
                  except in desperate cases."</p>
               <p>Poor Mag! she was sick; she did not dare risk herself on the overland route
                     <emph>alone,</emph> so she took steamer for Charleston.</p>
               <p>She waved her handkerchief, with a parting smile of thanks to her
                     "<emph>minister,</emph>" as she stood upon the deck, and the steamboat left the
                  pier at New York; and once more she was "<emph>alone</emph> upon the waters."</p>
               <p>"Well, Miss Barclay," said she, "it is no more funny this time than it was the
                  last time, when you received that interesting epistle from Lieutenant Moore; but
                  never mind. If you could only prevail upon a shower of respectable tears to come
                  to your relief, it might be considered by the virtuous as the proper thing, and it
                  might be amusing employment, under the circumstances, and you seem at present to
                  have no especial entertainment for pastime except your bandbox! By the by, what a
                  relief to have such a source of comfort and employment to a mind in vacuo!"</p>
               <p>Mag picked up that bandbox—it was a pet bandbox—it contained her Sunday hat. Of
                  course, she could not go even into a heathen land without a Sunday hat. There was
                  a Sunday all the world over; and she, a Puritan-bred, church-going Yankee girl, to
                  leave the land of civilization for Mississippi without her Sunday hat!
                  Preposterous! Her trunks, however, had overflowed with some very useless (!)
                  books, and crowded out that indispensable piece of bodily furniture, and the last
                  resort was a bandbox! She had protected it from enemies thus far—she remembered
                  how ruefully and spitefully the "minister" had eyed it; she caught him once
                  doubling his fist at it with a malicious look, as if it would have delighted him
                  to have pitched it after Curtius—when he jumped into a patriot's grave in the
                  Roman forum. How men do hate bandboxes!</p>
               <p>She picked the thing up, as we have said, with a due sense of its need of
                  protection, and went to her state-room; trying, as she went, to raise a little
                  sublime enthusiasm—for she saw the blue-green-black waves tumbling around the
                  steamboat—about "old hoary ocean." She thought a few things about "mountain
                  billows." She remembered that Byron, on a similar occasion, probably, had said to
                  the salt water, "Roll on thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll!" but she thought, on
                  the whole, that <emph>she</emph> wouldn't say it, for it would "roll on," anyway,
                  just the same—her words would not affect the ocean <emph>much!</emph> And,
                  somehow, she did not feel romantic; she felt rather dolefully; she had not yet
                  acquired a particular love for the "ocean," as Byron had; it required a cultivated
                  taste in her, for—for—it must be put down in romance as a fiction
                     <emph>almost</emph> as strange as <emph>fact</emph>—there was coming up a
                  driving storm; the wind and rain chased the ship mightily, and Mag got mighty
                  sea-sick. Being in an indifferent frame of mind at the time, she carelessly poked
                  her elbow through the window, letting in upon her a crash of glass, as well as the
                  fine driving storm. Well, it felt cool and comfortable, under the
                  circumstances—the wind and rain did—for she was feeling terribly feverish—and as
                  she did not flatter herself she could stop the storm, she concluded that she just
                  would not <emph>try</emph>—she would let it drive <emph>on</emph> and
                     <emph>in,</emph> and she did; so, when she reached Charleston, she was not able
                  to speak aloud, which made no particular difference, as she had no one to speak
                  to; but somehow, something ailed her head, or heart, or liver, or lungs, she did
                  not know precisely which, for she felt hot some, and some she felt cold; so she
                  stopped at the Charleston Hotel, and sent for Dr. Robertson to prescribe for
                  her.</p>
               <p>"Do you suppose I am sick, doctor?" she asked, laughing. "I am sure I don't know,
                  and I will be obliged to you to find out."</p>
               <p>"No," said he; "there is not a particle of disease in your whole system. I think
                  you will live eighty years yet, if not a thousand."</p>
               <p>"What a shocking disappointment! Don't tell me so, doctor! You are sure I have not
                  an organic <emph>affection</emph> of the heart, that will carry me off soon?"</p>
               <p>"Your heart will never give way! You could not give it away!"</p>
               <p>"And my brain?—no predisposition to be <emph>light-headed?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Not enough to do any harm. Drink a nice bowl of tea,<pb n="312-313"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000157"/> go to bed and sleep soundly. I will call on you
                  some time to-morrow, and in twenty-four hours you may go on to Montgomery."</p>
               <p>And Major F. M. Robertson, M.D., sat an hour, and talked of his adventures in the
                  Florida war, and the talk was better for Mag than a bushel of sugar-plums, even in
                  broken doses.</p>
               <p>The next day she awoke in the course of the morning, made her toilette, rang for
                  her breakfast, drew up the sofa before the fire—room No. 120, Charleston
                  Hotel—cushioned herself upon it, and lay there and <emph>meditated.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Poor Mag! She had received many good things in this life, for which she had not
                  been thankful. She had, like many another poor sinner, taken the good she had
                  received as her <emph>right;</emph> and when it was taken from her, it never
                  occurred to her to say with Job, "The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away;
                  blessed be the name of the Lord." She had an indefinite, nay, quite a definite
                  idea, that <emph>if</emph> there was a God, which at present she very much
                  doubted, she had been very cruelly treated; but as she could not prevent it, and
                     <emph>crying</emph> would do no good, she would laugh about it—it was the best
                  thing. Was she not an <emph>orphan?</emph> How Mag harped upon that, just as
                  though there were not thousands in the world worse than orphaned—thousands of
                  parents whom it is impossible for children to "honor" or reverence, since they
                  bring to themselves and their children only curses!</p>
               <p>Poor Mag! She had the indefinite idea that <emph>if</emph> God existed, He
                     <emph>owed</emph> her something; in some way she ought to have compensation for
                  the bread of charity she had eaten; that bread had not been sweet or delicious;
                  she had never been able to discipline her taste to <emph>love</emph> it—it was too
                  intolerably bitter.</p>
               <p>She had taken Frank's love as a <emph>right;</emph> she had taken the love of
                  Charles Moore as a <emph>right,</emph> and had never thanked God for them, poor
                  sinner; but demanded as a further <emph>right</emph> some very proud gifts. She
                  had met and loved two noble souls on God's earth. She had no idea—with all her
                  irreverence and contempt for diminutive and fractional souls—she had not the
                  remotest idea but that such magnanimous souls were <emph>common</emph> on the
                  earth. She thought she should meet them and know them, and they would recognize
                  her. She had to learn that <emph>integers</emph>—whole souls—cross the orbits of
                  earthly existence as rarely as comets. Poor Mag! Poor little simpleton. She
                  thought, too, she had measured herself; thought she had some idea of her position
                  in the scale of humanity. She considered herself a perfect miracle of
                  conscientiousness; gave herself credit for being one of those magnetic souls that
                  continually attract and influence other souls! What a quantity of nonsense had to
                  be taken out of her! Frank had predicted it. She had said to herself that she was
                  proud and inconsistent, and she hugged that saying to herself with a deal of
                  satisfaction, as if it had been a very wise, meek, humble, and consistent
                  saying.</p>
               <p>She had come out now into the world to fight her battle <emph>alone.</emph>
                  Wonderfully independent she felt; no human being was concerned in her welfare; she
                  was free to go to destruction if she chose; she was not sure but she was going,
                  whether she chose or not; she would laugh if it was so—no use in crying. By the
                  by, was she <emph>sinking</emph> into the unfathomable abyss, or was she
                     <emph>rising</emph> to the unfathomable infinite? God only knew—if there was a
                  God. Was she degenerating, or being purified as by fire, by all her fiery thought?
                  At times, when she thought herself going down, <emph>down,</emph> DOWN! to
                  bottomless depths, she was to be surprised to find herself suddenly standing on
                  firm ground, which she deemed the <emph>bottom</emph> of her abyss of sorrow and
                  degradation. On that ground she was to stand and gather new strength—Anteus
                  strength. A strange daring, almost like hope, was to visit her often there; a hope
                  that, after all, the death which would full surely come at some time—no
                     <emph>doubt</emph> about that—might at least be a <emph>variety</emph> to
                  experience. And when she got utterly tired of earth, she herself
                     <emph>could</emph> open the beautiful gates, and see what was the knowledge
                  that lay beyond. In the depths of that abyss she had dreams of the
                     <emph>Beautiful.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>We <emph>do</emph> worship beauty! It is implanted in our nature—the worship of
                  the beautiful. We worship human beauty; it is the noblest type of ideal
                  loveliness. Mag loved the beautiful.</p>
               <p>She dreamed delirious dreams of manly strength and beauty—of perfection. She bent
                  her heart in worship of one form; and in her adoration, she loved to clothe her
                  own physical charms in glorious garments <emph>for him.</emph> In the eyes of one
                  human living being she longed to look beautiful. In dreams she doffed the black
                  garments, in which the world saw her clothed; and in dreams she arrayed herself
                  for <emph>him.</emph> Then she looked down into her anxious soul, stilled her<pb
                     n="314-315" xml:id="VAC6426-00000158"/> throbbing heart, sunned herself in his
                  smiles, drank silver melody from his lips; his hot passion tones wooed her; in
                  dreams she floated with him on radiant clouds to heaven, and slept on thrones.</p>
               <p>Poor, little, wayward, earth-born Mag! She meditated sublimely as she lay upon the
                  sofa, with her brown eyes watching the fire.</p>
               <p>Just as she had again <emph>dared</emph> fate to do her worst, for she had no
                     <emph>fear</emph>—fate could never force tears of brine from her human eyes,
                  though her human heart should ooze itself away in tears of blood—Dr. Robertson
                  came to visit his patient.</p>
               <p>"It is splendid," said she to him on parting, "to cure a lady without medicine or
                  charges! You must appreciate Plato, sir! Please accept a copy of Bohn's
                  translation, to remind you of a stranger whom you have benefited; and be assured,
                  that in the first book I publish, I shall book you as the very best physician I
                  ever met in Charleston."</p>
               <p>The next morning, Mag and her bandbox were on their "winding way." A few miles
                  from Charleston, the car took fire in which she was sitting, and in the mêlée, her
                  bandbox was in immense danger of annihilation, besides Mag herself getting
                  suffocated with heat and smoke, till she grew black in the face. A benevolent
                  individual, who sat behind her, rescued the bandbox, gallantly helped her over the
                  tops of half-a-dozen seats, knocked a few people out of her way, gave her one
                  tremendous push through a few more into the fresh air, where she took breath, and
                  therefore went on her way, her spirit still in the flesh, which was probably as
                  convenient an arrangement for the spirit as the flesh. This benevolent personage
                  also saw her safely exchange cars at Augusta.</p>
               <p>She met no further adventure that interested her until she reached Montgomery,
                  with one exception. At Atalanta, Peel's Campbell minstrels came on the cars. One
                  member of the troupe, a good-looking young fellow, took his seat immediately
                  before her, leading by a string a most exquisitely interesting phenomenon in the
                  shape of a forlorn, half-blind infant puppy, which puppy Mag pitied with a great
                  pity, and which pity the puppy seemed to appreciate, for he climbed up the back of
                  her seat, and looking intently into her face, commenced a series of the most
                  distressed yelping, whining, and barking that his utmost capacity could
                  accomplish. Mag smiled affectionately into his face; she saw his powers were
                  feeble; she encouraged him, assured him that she considered him a "poor fellow," a
                  "good fellow," asking him "where lay his pain?" All in vain; the dog would not be
                  comforted of his wonderful grief, and at last his master smothered it by shutting
                  the poor puppy's mouth with his hand, and holding it in durance, telling Mag, as
                  an apology for the puppy's impertinence, that his bark was much worse than his
                  bite—which is the case with the whole generation of mortal puppies—and in this
                  case the bark was unusually feeble, and gave Mag much food for contemplation. A
                  few minutes after, as some of that Campbell troupe were discussing their
                  experiences, in language more forcible than polite and chaste, the dog's young
                  master went to them, leading the quadruped by his string, and Mag heard an
                  emphatic whispered "Hush-sh-sh, there is a <emph>lady</emph> present!" Mag was
                  conscious of their glances toward her; the tone of the conversation changed
                  instanter, and Mag in her heart pronounced the master of that little puppy a
                     <emph>gentleman,</emph> and thanked him for his delicacy of feeling; and
                  thought of pistol-shooting in Hartford, and a pious, Christian gentleman she once
                  met there.</p>
               <p>Next, Mag found herself on the steamer St. Nicholas, in the Alabama River, minus
                  her trunks and bandbox. "There is a way out of every trouble, if one could only
                  find it," she said to herself. She went to the captain, and in her own laughing
                  style informed him of her dilemma.</p>
               <p>"Had she her checks?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, but the trunks were not on board."</p>
               <p>"They must be at the depot, then."</p>
               <p>Here a young military student from Marietta, Ga.—Mag fancied military
                  students—offered his services to track the trunks—" and bandbox," Mag put
                  in—through every hotel in Montgomery, while one of the depot agents, who was
                  listening, offered to storm the depot—it being eleven o'clock at night. Mag was
                  resigned, and spent the interval in writing a love-letter to May Burton. Depot
                  agent returned without Mag's worldly possessions; military student ditto; and Mag
                  tried her laughing philosophy, asking the "agent" if he thought she could possibly
                  "play pretty" enough to the captain to induce him to do anything further; if not,
                  she must go ashore, if it was midnight.</p>
               <p>"Don't go yet," said the agent, "I heard the captain cursing some of the servants
                  just now; he was swearing that the boat should not leave till the lady's trunks
                     were<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC6426-00000159"/> forthcoming. No doubt the
                  servants have smuggled them."</p>
               <p>Soon after the gentleman sent for Mag to come to her state-room door, the missing
                  articles were there, safe and sound.</p>
               <p>"How did the things reach here?" she asked in astonishment.</p>
               <p>"A <emph>special providence,</emph> no doubt."</p>
               <p>Mag began to believe in special providences.</p>
               <p>"They came on wings, certain, sir! A half-hour since, they were not here, to my
                  sure knowledge. But how can I thank you, sir, for your benevolence?"</p>
               <p>"Allow me to congratulate you!"</p>
               <p>"Well, it is unspeakable, sir!" Mag's eyes were shining with a puzzled look; she
                  did not know what was <emph>proper</emph> under the circumstances. "Will you
                  permit me to shake hands with you upon it?"</p>
               <p>And the two shook hands very happily and cordially, and parted.</p>
               <p>The bandbox and Sunday hat were somewhat damaged.</p>
               <p>The military student informed Mag that the company had concluded, from her
                  appearance, that she must be a "literary lady." They sailed down the river very
                  placidly, Mag thanking them mentally, for their opinion, but denied the soft
                  impeachment, saying to herself, that unfortunately she was but a Yankee
                  schoolmistress come south to seek her fortunes.</p>
               <p>The next thing that occupied her attention was a chicken—a real, bona-fide
                     <emph>feathered</emph> biped, that got astray on that Alabama River. The boat
                  had stopped at a bluff, and was taking on cotton, when the little, frightened,
                  desperate, ambitious thing escaped from its prison on the hurricane deck, and
                  fluttered out to <emph>freedom,</emph> landing on the rocky, muddy banks of the
                  Alabama, leaving its wits elsewhere.</p>
               <p>"Dear, dear, what quantities of bipeds there are," thought Mag, "who want what
                  they can't get, and when they get it, get what they don't want."</p>
               <p>The chicken went shrieking and fluttering, up one rock and down another, as if it
                  had scattered seventeen senses in as many different directions, and was risking
                  life and limb to collect them again. And Mag looked up at the wild vines climbing
                  the gigantic forest trees on the river, and the waving moss, and the little white
                  heron that hovered over the dipping willow branches, and the big, black alligators
                  gators that <emph>didn't.</emph> And she wondered if she had not fluttered out to
                  freedom with the desperate daring of that crazy chicken—and, poor child, she had.
                  She thought a special providence ought to be taking care of her, and so she
                  believed she would do as she would be done by—be a special providence to the
                  benighted chicken, and she was! She flew down—not on wings, for she had not
                  received any <emph>as yet</emph>—down a flight of steps, over forty or a thousand
                  bales of cotton, more or less, walked a plank, climbed a bank, and <emph>chased
                     the chicken!</emph> Poor little fool, it was afraid of her, ran from her as if
                  she had been an evil spirit, never mistrusting that she was a special providence,
                  but that was natural. Here a gentleman helped the unfeathered as well as the
                  feathered chicken out of their respective dilemmas. Mag caught the fellow—the
                  chicken, not the gentleman—carried him tenderly into the cabin, introduced him to
                  the ladies, who treated him to piano music and other refreshments, dismissed him
                  at last to the highest sphere, and then Mag and the gentleman moralized. Mag, of
                  course, questioned the utility of so much <emph>pain</emph> and fright to the
                  chicken; and also, of course, they stumbled upon a discussion, in which the
                  gentleman vindicated the ways of Providence with men; and Mag forgot her pain and
                  solitude, forgot that she was "weary long ago," she "forgot herself and the
                  universe" in listening. The hours rolled on till midnight, a group of men and
                  ladies gathered silently around and listened—the stars came out—she poured out
                  question after question, which the stranger, a grave, elderly, noble-looking man,
                  answered patiently, eloquently, and earnestly.</p>
               <p>She awoke from her abstraction at last, and rose to go.</p>
               <p>"And now, my child," said he, smiling gravely, "may I ask you one question:
                     <emph>Do you believe in God?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"You yourself, sir, have proved to me the existence of <emph>two equal
                     gods.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"What taught you all the questions you have asked me?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Pain</emph> and <emph>suffering</emph> have their uses, sir; they are all
                  that teach a woman to <emph>think.</emph> I may possibly be like our little stray
                  chicken, lost alone on the rocks and quicksands of the river of life. I would like
                  to learn if an Over-ruling Providence will save me as it did the chicken."</p>
               <p>"Then you, too, have gone out into the wilderness for forty days and nights to be
                  tempted of the devil—you innocent child?"</p>
               <pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC6426-00000160"/>
               <p>"By ten thousand of them, sir. Any hope for me?"</p>
               <p>"You will not be tempted beyond refuge. Legions of angels will minister unto you.
                  Be assured of that."</p>
               <p>"Thank you for the assurance, sir; and good night."</p>
               <p>The gentleman was Rev. Mr. F——, of Demopolis, a Scotch divine. He left at Selma,
                  and Mag saw his face no more.</p>
               <p>A pleasant time they had down the river. One day the boat was aground, and she
                  watched the amphibious boatmen haul it off the sand-banks. And then the negroes!
                  There was a large party on the lower decks, emigrants for Texas, who were
                  wonderfully musical at night; they lay on the cotton bales in the moonlight, and
                  Mag learned their camp-meeting choruses, and showered them with "sugar plums,"
                  which she sent for at the <emph>Bar,</emph> which showers caused some break-neck
                  scrambles among the ebons, and called out the white expression of their teeth and
                  eyes, till they seemed crazy with joy. Mag and the darkies seemed the happiest
                  creatures in Christendom. What sorrows either were capable of suffering, God only
                  knows, as He alone knew whether at that time any <emph>calamity, past all
                     sorrow,</emph> was sitting at their hearts. "There hath no temptation taken
                  you, but such as is <emph>common</emph> to man," wrote Paul, the Christian martyr,
                  years ago, to <emph>bond and free</emph> in Christendom.</p>
               <p>A night at the Battle House, Mobile—a journey up the Bigbee River, and Mag found
                  herself landed at Bladon Springs, and greeted by Mr. Church, principal elect of
                  the Clarke Co. Institute.</p>
               <p>The "season" had not commenced at the Springs, and no conveyance could be obtained
                  for love or money, to take them thirty miles into the frontier life of the
                  Southwest. After staying and drinking sulphur-water enough to make them sick, they
                  undertook the journey on horseback. Mag gave up the bandbox in despair; bade it
                  adieu with accustomed resignation and composure, consoling herself with Pope:
                  "Whatever is, is right." We may here add its sad fate.</p>
               <p>When next Mag's longing eyes greeted it, it was as near utter annihilation as ever
                  bandbox was. To all intents and Sunday purposes, it was utterly annihilated.</p>
               <p>A great <emph>moral</emph> was thereby indoctrinated with Mag's theories of
                  morals, viz.: Ladies ought never to travel with bandboxes.</p>
               <p>Thirty miles on horseback! And such horses! One was an elephantine plough-horse;
                  Mag's was a miniature edition of horse-flesh, with a gait that gave great exercise
                  up and down, and around and about, to her lungs. The movement is styled the
                  "knitting-needle gait." After riding all day, she thought of that horse that
                  trotted a half-hour in the shadow of a half-bushel; Mag declared that her lungs
                  were jolted into jelly, and she believed that "<emph>variety</emph> was the spice
                  of life that gave it <emph>all</emph> its flavor." Mr. Church assented, and they
                  exchanged animals. She mounted the elephant, and walked leisurely and in peace to
                  her journey's end, while her companion performed the "knitting work."</p>
               <p>Night overtook them in the pine forests, and the forests were <emph>on
                     fire!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>As far as the eye could reach, the dry leaves, and piles of dry logs and brush,
                  were blazing. The long lines of light illuminated the very tree-tops, and the
                  brilliant moonlight through the white smoke, looked like midnight rainbows. Mag
                  forgot her fatigue in watching their beauty. At eleven o'clock her journey was
                  accomplished.</p>

               <head>XXV. FRONTIER LIFE.</head>
               <p>"IT most surely cannot be that you are listening to the 'harmony of the spheres,'
                  Miss Barclay," said Mag next morning to her prime minister, as she awoke. She was
                  listening to what seemed some very <emph>unearthly</emph> music, issuing from the
                  earth beneath her, instead of the heavens above. Mag thought the "spheres" must be
                  in distress, by their groans—if it was the spheres—but she had concluded that it
                     <emph>wasn't.</emph> The music was a series of grunts, interspersed with notes,
                  long and short, shrill and sweet—perhaps—of course those who uttered the squealing
                  considered it sweet—"De gustibus," etc.—and Mag was impressed with a sense of the
                  harmony. She rubbed open her eyes, to open her mind to the full comprehension of
                  the subject. It was a<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC6426-00000161"/> matter for
                  thought experiment. The sense of the ludicrous overpowered Mag's sense of the
                  harmonious, as well as her other senses.</p>
               <p>"If I am not mistaken, Miss Barclay, you once read in the Book, that the herd of
                  swine who were possessed of evil spirits, ran violently down a steep hill into the
                  sea, and perished. This could not have been that herd; but they set a praiseworthy
                  example. I think these must be 'possessed.' I wonder if there isn't a 'steep hill'
                  out somewhere near, and I wonder if these little pigs could not be induced to
                  follow the example of their ancestors. You are said to have enticing ways, Miss
                  Barclay; for mercy's sake, try your powers on the pigs."</p>
               <p>Mag bethought herself of her toilette. With astonishment, as she performed it, she
                  commenced taking notes. She had been too much exhausted the night previous to
                  notice anything noteworthy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Note the First.—She was in a log-house, containing four rooms, two
                  separated from the other two by a wide passage or balcony, connecting with the
                  piazza, which ran across the front of the establishment.</p>
               <p>Mag looked through the cracks in the logs as she lay on her couch, and saw in the
                  neighboring room—no matter what!</p>
               <p>She turned her eyes away, caught glances of the open sky smiling down upon her
                  from between the rafters and shingles in the roof. Afterward the rain visited her
                  through those very cracks and crevices, while she dreamed upon that little bed of
                  pine; and the winds came to her there with their funny tales, besides those tales
                  that were not so very funny.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Note the Second.—Although her neighbors, the pigs, had their bed
                  beneath hers, there was a floor between the two beds. Afterwards, at her forcible
                  suggestions, they were convinced of the propriety of the thing, and kindly vacated
                  their apartments. They brought too much company into her room—a continuous party
                  of fleas.</p>
               <p>Company is a fine thing in its place; but Mag had always tried to be very select
                  in her associations—"A man (much more a woman) being known by the company he
                  keeps." Mag acknowledged herself a flea, but not precisely of that species—she
                  preferred her own kind—which was natural; she did not choose this style of flea
                  society.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="i"/>Note the Third.—A floor was between the two beds. And such a floor!
                  Every plank loose—not a nail to fasten them. The floor had been constructed in the
                  pressure of a first settlement in the backwoods, was laid of green plank, which in
                  drying had warped and curved to leave open intervals for communication with the
                  neighbors beneath. As Mag attempted to walk, the plank kept up a sort of see-saw
                  motion, which discomposed her a little at first; it was accompanied by a music
                  which was excessively novel, and which pleased Mag as she took her first exercises
                  in walking a plank. After she became accustomed to it, and had learned the art of
                  balancing herself on a movable platform, her equanimity became excessively
                  composed.</p>
               <p>To assist in her toilette, a little darkey soon entered, with a crash towel, a tin
                  wash-pan, and no soap. "What! no soap?" quoted she to herself, from Foote, "So he
                  died"—and she put her pretty fingers into the water, and put the water on her
                  face, instead of putting her face into the washpan of water, "and she very
                  imprudently married the barber." Mag went on with the quotation and her ablutions
                  together, supplying deficiencies from her trunks, "and there were present the
                  Picaninnies and the Job-lilies, and the Garulies, and the grand Panjandrum
                  himself, with the little round button at top; and they all fell at playing catch
                  as catch can, till the gunpowder ran out of the heels of their boots."</p>
               <p>Mag was struck with the appropriateness of the emphatic sentiments, under the
                  circumstances. She went out for an introduction to her host and hostess, who
                  deserve a particular introduction here, and shall have it.</p>
               <p>Judge John James Jacobs, president of the Board of Trustees of the Clarke Co.
                  Institute, stood six feet and two inches in his boots; his weight physically was
                  over two hundred—morally and mentally, his weight is not recorded, but it was
                  somewhat less.</p>
               <p>Physically, his lady was about fifty pounds less than her lord; morally, she was
                  far his superior; mentally, not recorded—her mind being yet in its native
                  simplicity; like Eve, she never knew books.</p>
               <p>The only time that Mag ever saw her use one, she seemed in profound abstraction
                  over its ideas; which was not wonderful, as she was making the effort to discover
                  them, with the book up-side-down, and it requires practice to decipher ideas
                  easily thus.</p>
               <p>She was of an uncertain age—say "fair, fat, forty," and more.</p>
               <pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC6426-00000162"/>
               <p>The judge was a self-made man, for which he deserved credit—his calibre was of an
                  indescribable species, a cross between Ovid Bolus and Simon Suggs, in Baldwin's
                  "Flush Times of Alabama and Mississippi." We refer the curious to that book of
                  genius, for further information as to his "toot onsaumbel," as "Kit North" so
                  charmingly expresses himself.</p>
               <p>Judge Jacobs, we say, was a self-made man. At the tender age of nineteen, when the
                  down of adolescence was springing upon his soft cheek, he had found himself the
                  principal of an "old field school," a description of which "Southern Institution"
                  may be found in the Memoirs of Dr. Alexander, of Princeton. Then and there he met
                  his destiny, a blooming lady of twenty-three, a daughter of that class of people,
                  called in southern parlance, "poor white folks;" from which station, by degrees,
                  her husband had promoted her to the positions of mistress of his household,
                  consisting of—no matter how many servants, now—and the mother of eleven
                  children—the full dozen not yet accomplished. After marriage, he had studied law a
                  month or two, obtained a license, became probate judge, wherefore he wrote "Hon."
                  before his name; also became president of the Board of Trustees of the educational
                  interests of Clarke Co., Mississippi.</p>
               <p>The entire household can be numerated. The white family consisted of the judge,
                  his lady and the eleven children; the servants were Aunt Nancy, the cook—a
                  gigantic Amazon of a mulatto, who continually reminded Mag of Grandma Barclay—with
                  twin babies six months of age, who helped in the cooking; three little motherless
                  girls of the ages of one, two and three years, who did likewise—a house girl,
                  named Betty—a boy of fourteen, named Washington, who cut wood for the whole
                  establishment, and a girl of thirteen, who was nurse for the eleven white
                  children, and assistant nurse for the five mulatto babies. All of the servants,
                  including the five infants, occupied the one log house, yclept the kitchen,
                  consisting of one room, where all the cooking for the whole household was done,
                  also all the sleeping and eating for the darkies.</p>
               <p>This establishment of servants was a source of infinite trouble to the "mistress,"
                  she being "poor white folks" originally, and not accustomed to the management of
                  servants. Aunt Nancy was a "hired servant," and, unfortunately, much wiser than
                  her mistress, and had no love for her, and usually spent her wisdom in contriving
                  ways to provoke her.</p>
               <p>"Disappointments are not usually considered blissful experiences, Miss Barclay,"
                  said Mag to herself; "but you may be able to cultivate a taste for them—it will be
                  entirely a cultivated taste. At present, I think that you and I both have a
                  decided aversion for them. Nevertheless, we are anxious to learn all that life has
                  to teach, and we will be sure never to slight a lesson."</p>
               <p>"How do you like the South, Miss Barclay?" asked the judge, and the judge's lady,
                  and every person she met for months.</p>
               <p>Mag gave fractional answers to the questions, with her brightest smiles, for the
                  ludicrous would come up. She thought of Frank's dictum, "The truth is too precious
                  to waste on ordinary occasions."</p>
               <p>She exerted herself to discover the charms of southern life; she remembered
                  Charles Moore's descriptions of the Huntsville <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >élite,</foreign> and compared her notes with his. She found it a contrast
                  instead of a comparison. It was with some difficulty that she learned to
                  appreciate the South.</p>
               <p>"How do you fancy the Institution buildings?" asked Mr. Church, with a comical
                  look, as they walked out to take a view of the place.</p>
               <p>The village consisted of some dozen log houses, scattered through the pine
                  forests. The Institute buildings were also of logs, with chimneys built of sticks
                  and plastered with mud.</p>
               <p>"Do you intend to stay?" asked Mag.</p>
               <p>"The salary is really very liberal, and that is secured to us."</p>
               <p>"Will you bring Mrs. Church here?"</p>
               <p>"Not at present; she is not well, and would die here. She is not accustomed to
                  roughing it in the backwoods, and I should be ashamed to ask my wife to come here.
                  We shall have to rough it if you decide to stay."</p>
               <p>After a consultation with the Board of Trustees, both decided to stay, and do with
                  their might what their hands found to do. In fact, there was nothing else left,
                  Mag being out of money, "urged by hunger," and so she determined to fight the
                  battle of life out against all odds—and they were all against her. "Urged by
                  hunger," social, mental, moral and physical hunger, that was never
                  satisfied—nothing but famine.</p>
               <pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC6426-00000163"/>
               <p>Her boarding-house was the best in the place, and it did not improve on
                  acquaintance, though she made numerous acquaintances. She became familiar with
                  every species of filth, thanks to Aunt Nancy and the kitchen arrangements; then
                  others made use of her toilet articles, till she put them under lock and key, out
                  of the way of white children and black; fleas from her neighbors, the pigs,
                  visited her in crowds, till she entered suit against their preëmption rights; then
                  she became familiarly acquainted with bedbugs, who had a great fondness for her
                  o'nights, but whose affection it was difficult for her to reciprocate, even in
                  romantic moonlight, that hour for affection.</p>
               <p>Her host and hostess, in the excess of their southern hospitality, insisted upon
                  entertaining her, in her own room, till the latest hour for retiring, and as said
                  room played the part of parlor to the establishment also, why, Mag did not find
                  the time for solitary thought in which she could possibly carry out her resolve of
                  testing God and his Bible, and the faith described therein, by writing the
                  promised book!</p>
               <p>She tried to find the solitude as she had done in Glenlyn, by rambling in the
                  forests and communing with nature and her heart; but she was obliged to give it
                  up, after having narrowly escaped being bitten by three moccasins on the creek,
                  and two rattlesnakes in the undergrowth of the woods. Moreover, it was dangerous
                  to walk alone on the frontiers, on account of "runaway negroes," who frequently
                  infest them, lurking in the forests.</p>
               <p>Mag did her best, her very best; "did with her might what her hands found to do,"
                  sagely concluding, "such is life in its most unmitigated forms."</p>
               <p>But the Institute.</p>
               <p>The Hon. President of the Board of Trustees, with characteristic bombast, had
                  represented to Mr. Church that the Institute was an embryo college, to be
                  chartered at the next session of the legislature. At the first meeting of the
                  Board, the subject was duly discussed with the principal. The Board consisted of
                  moneyed planters of this wild southwest, whose plantations lay for miles around.
                  They offered very liberal endowments for the college, but as yet "the pear was not
                  ripe," the thing was in the germ; the first session of the school would show
                  whether the Institution could be built up and gain the confidence of the
                  community.</p>
               <p>The thing to be done was to draw patronage; for this all powers were put in play,
                  and all of Mag's were required. She combined in her one person the offices of
                  Principal of the Female Department and Professors of Music and the Fine Arts.
                  Spite of the company of the judge, his lady, and the eleven innocent children in
                  her room, she contrived to write original plays for a theatrical school
                  performance; she drilled all the musical abilities of both departments of the
                  Institution for a grand concert; posted all the classes, from the alphabet up to
                  geometry and belles lettres, for the examinations; and the session closed in
                  triumph. They had fought the rough battle for five months, and won. The patrons
                  became enthusiastic about the Institution. Pupils, from the first, came pouring
                  in—some from their homes, six and seven miles away, on horseback, muleback, in
                  carriages and buggies, till the log school-houses were thronged like
                  bee-hives.</p>
               <p>For the examinations, large arbors were constructed, as for a camp-meeting; the
                  patrons sent overseers and servants in armies to erect them. The posts consisted
                  of pine saplings; the roof was a high lattice-work of pine boughs. And all the
                  elite of Eastern Mississippi, for fifty miles around, were present in full dress
                  of silks, satins, diamonds, etc., at the finale.</p>
               <p>To entertain their guests, the trustees gave a barbacue. A long line of pits were
                  constructed; oxen, sheep, pigs, etc., were laid upon the coals, and a battalion of
                  sable cooks basted them with a sauce of butter, spice and vinegar, as they turned
                  them with their three-pronged forks. Mag watched all the operations, and thought
                  of Homer and Virgil.</p>
               <p>When all had passed by, there followed the most alarming and extravagant newspaper
                  puffs: the "Reports of the Examining Committee," which were written by the
                  president of the Board of Trustees, and in which all the classes that had made
                  extravagant failures were excessively eulogized, which proved to the principals
                  the blessing of ignorance in the heads of an examining committee. In geometry,
                  said committee were captivated by the "pictures," and not the demonstrations,
                  which they concluded must be all right, the classes being exceedingly
                  flippant.</p>
               <p>Then came the vacation; and for Mag it was full time, for the poor thing was
                  absolutely starved. To remedy the starvation, she commenced a course of chills and
                  fevers, which made ravages on what starvation had left of her physical
                  constitution.</p>
               <pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC6426-00000164"/>
               <p>"Good God! does she cast a shadow?" exclaimed one of her patrons one day, noticing
                  her cadaverous visage.</p>
               <p>Thanks to hoops and crinoline, and what they contained, Mag was able to cast a
                  very respectable shadow.</p>
               <p>But she got desperate with the hunger and fever, and one day went to Aunt
                  Nancy.</p>
               <p>"Aunty, for goodness sake, can't you find me something nice to eat? I am sick; and
                  this corn bread scratches my throat when I am well. I can't eat it when I try my
                  best, and I am sick now. I couldn't swallow it if it was the last on earth."</p>
               <p>"Laws, Miss Mag, honey, if Mistis Jacobs 'ud on'y give out any seasonin', I'd fix
                  somethin' mighty nice for you. You jest orter know how my mistis in Virginny let
                  me do."</p>
               <p>"Virginia?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, honey. Ole marster—not Mr. Jacobs, I don't b'long to him—my marster in
                  Virginny, had to sell us all 'cause he got in debt, and Mars' Chaney bought me.
                  Laws, chile! I've got a husband and eight chillen in Virginny."</p>
               <p>"Besides your husband and children here? You are well off. How many children have
                  you in all, Aunty?"</p>
               <p>"I've got <emph>nineteen</emph> chillen, Miss Mag. Let's see—" She commenced
                  counting on her fingers. "There's Washington, and Semira<emph>mus,</emph> and
                  Jeff, and Cely, and—and—I 'clare I can't remember 'em all; but there's
                     <emph>nineteen</emph> of 'em." And Aunt Nancy kept on counting on her fingers
                  till her wits were completely bewildered.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I know there's <emph>nineteen</emph> of 'em. There's <emph>eight</emph> in
                  Virginny"—she counted them again on her fingers—"and there's <emph>seven</emph>
                  here."</p>
               <p>"But that doesn't make nineteen," said Mag.</p>
               <p>"Wal, I don't care!" said Aunt Nancy, getting into confusion; "I know there's
                     <emph>nineteen</emph> in all; and there's <emph>eight</emph> in Virginny, and
                  there's <emph>seven</emph> here,"</p>
               <p>Mag never was able to solve the mystery about those children.</p>
               <p>"Did you ever see any of those Virginia children after you left them."</p>
               <p>"No, Miss Mag. Ole marster came out though to buy us back, arter he got out of
                  debt—he promised us he would do it when we left Virginny—but Marster Chaney liked
                  us; he didn't want us to go back; so we staid here. But little Chloe, my baby,
                  that I left there, is dead."</p>
               <p>"Your master told you so?"</p>
               <p>"Laws, no, honey; she <emph>appeared</emph> to me arter she died—a little white
                  angel with wings; she tol' me how she was dead, and I know she is—I shouldn't know
                  any better ef I'd seen her buried with my own eyes."</p>
               <p>Aunt Nancy had not a shadow of doubt about that baby, and Mag swallowed a great
                  lump of envy at the faith of the woman, for her own was in a despairing condition,
                  as usual.</p>
               <p>Yes, Mag was sick. She took chills and fevers, and then blue-mass and quinine, and
                  wanted to get hold of some of Aunt Lina's biscuit or cream-toast, or anything but
                  the abominable—we won't say what—served up for her, whether sick or well. She
                  could get nothing palatable for love or money.</p>
               <p>"The only philosophy 'in a world like this,' as Longfellow and Frank have it, is
                  to make fun of sorrow," she said to herself; "but when it comes to absolute
                  starvation, it is cultivating the funny under difficulties. When one is hungry for
                  comfort, and can find nothing to eat but one's own heart, it is not comfortable,
                  at first. Being fond of nothing to eat, is entirely an acquired taste."</p>
               <p>But one day a neighbor, in the bounty of her heart, sent Mag some cake and
                  sweetmeats; she eat them, and came very near eating no more on earth, for they
                  gave her cramp in the stomach, which it requires a highly cultivated taste to
                  enjoy. A physician was sent for in double quick time, to keep her from dying. By a
                  special Providence, he was in the neighborhood, and the minister too. The reverend
                  gentleman hurried in to witness the "last agony," and insisted upon trying to
                  "save her soul." Mag refused to listen to him; the soul might take care of itself;
                  she was too busy trying to breathe to attempt its salvation then. The good man
                  went away terribly shocked that one so young should be so careless and unconcerned
                  at such an awful moment—the moment of death. Mag had long before concluded that it
                  was a much more awful thing to live than die. And she was more than half right; if
                  men are prepared to <emph>live,</emph> they are prepared to <emph>die.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. Hudson came and undertook the salvation of the body, instead of the soul, and
                  that was to the purpose; gave her a powerful emetic in powerful haste—and not any
                  too soon, for her pulse was gone, and her breath almost gone—but she was saved—at
                  least her skepticism had a longer probation.</p>
               <pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC6426-00000165"/>
               <p>Dr. Hudson took a fancy to his patient, for some reason not recorded—perhaps
                  Christian charity—told her she "bore pain like a major," sent his carriage for her
                  as soon as she could ride, and so she rested for an interval from hunger and worse
                  than solitude. Martin Luther says that the society of one's pigs is better than
                  utter solitude. Mag always thought that Martin Luther was propounding a theory
                  that he had never tried by practice, when he said that. She had tried the theory
                  thoroughly, and was convinced that Luther was mistaken.</p>
               <p>Mag regained health and strength rapidly, thanks to a finely developed physical
                  constitution—thanks to the mountain air of New England. With Dr. and Mrs. Hudson
                  she rode into the forests on horseback to cut bee-trees, went fishing and hunting,
                  and felt quite like herself again. Then with good things to eat! Their table was
                  loaded with the frontier luxuries—wild turkey, venison, and all kinds of game.</p>
               <p>The next session of the Institute commenced under new auspices. Mag resigned the
                  principalship to Mrs. Church, who insisted upon joining her husband. Mag only took
                  charge of the department of the arts. As Dr. and Mrs. Hudson sent for her nearly
                  every week, and loaded her carpet-bag with "goodies" when they sent her home, it
                  was quite an improvement. The second session closed, and so did her first year in
                  Mississippi; she went to spend the vacation with Dr. and Mrs. Hudson.</p>
               <p>It was a pleasant home. We must describe its arrangements.</p>
               <p>There was a good, substantial log-house, shaded by splendid oaks. A black baby in
                  a scarlet dress was sitting on the nice, white piazza floor, eating a biscuit, as
                  the carriage drove up. Mrs. Hudson sent her black pet to its mammy's cabin as soon
                  as she saw her company arrive; Mag entered the large, airy parlor, with its sanded
                  floor. Its furniture consisted of a mahogany framed bed, covered with a fine
                  Marseilles counterpane heavily fringed, a handsome rosewood piano, a fine
                  secretary filled with books, and two large mohair cushioned rocking chairs,
                  stationed on either side of the fire-place, which was filled with pine boughs. And
                  what a luxury to eat clean food, especially with silver forks! They ventured on
                  the discussion of slavery at times, even at the table.</p>
               <p>"Did you ever see Madam Stowe?" asked Mrs. Hudson son one day, as she handed
                  half-a-dozen lemons to a little darkey grinning by her. "What do you think of
                  those books of hers?"</p>
               <p>Mag never had formed an opinion.</p>
               <p>"It is an obsolete question, Mrs. Hudson—but what do you think of them? Madam
                  Stowe is not a favorite in the South."</p>
               <p>"Think of them? Here, Wat, take this, you little rascal!"</p>
               <p>She gave him a slice of bread, butter and honey.</p>
               <p>"And go tell your mammy to send me the nutmeg grater to make lemonade."</p>
               <p>The bread and butter vanished suddenly through Wat's open countenance, and he
                  imitated its example through the open door, while Mag laughed at the turn of
                  thought.</p>
               <p>"I think that if every incident in her book is a fact—yet the books, on the whole,
                  are as big lies as were ever written—it would be about as true to represent
                  marriage by all the divorce cases that could be collected, and prove it to be
                  unholy by a key showing that the divorces were all facts."</p>
               <p>Wat popped his head in at the door, ready to dodge at an instant's notice. He
                  thought he was going to be funny.</p>
               <p>"Mammy says she's done lost the <emph>mutton leg gitter.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"The nutmeg grater, you little scamp," said his mistress, laughing, and Wat
                  disappeared with a pleasing grin and brought it.</p>
               <p>"If you want to make your fortune by writing an abolition book, I can tell you of
                  worse cases of inhuman treatment than any ever written. Just here I can give you
                  some splendid capital. Pity that Mrs. Stowe has quite overdone the thing," said
                  Dr. Hudson. "Here, Becky, show yourself."</p>
               <p>A black, short, chubby, shining-faced, good-natured, happy looking mortal, who was
                  waiting on the table, at this address, looked modest, with an attempt to blush,
                  which attempt proved abortive, on account of her complexion. She was entirely
                  unconscious of the elements of her history that made her capable of being
                  lionized.</p>
               <p>"That lady made a great commotion in the adjoining county last year. She belongs
                  to the estates of some minor heirs, whose guardian hired her out last year to an
                  educated Irishman, by name of Halloran, who owned a small farm in Choctaw Co.,
                  Alabama. The wretch abused his<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC6426-00000166"/> servants
                  shamefully—they were not his own. He burned this girl with irons, sawed her limbs,
                  starved her—God knows what he did not do with her, till she escaped to her master,
                  a perfect wreck in health."</p>
               <p>"What came of it all?" asked Mag.</p>
               <p>"Major Vivion prosecuted a dozen different suits against Halloran, for as many
                  different kinds of abuse, gained them all, and when he had done with the villain,
                  the county, to show righteous indignation, took the case in hand, to put him
                  through the fire with further prosecutions, till, finding the country growing too
                  hot for his comfort, he privately gathered up his plunder and decamped to
                  Arkansas. The girl was sent here to be cured."</p>
               <p>Mag looked shocked.</p>
               <p>"I could give other instances of cruelty worse than that, if possible, which never
                  came to punishment, because negro testimony is not legal, against an
                  overseer."</p>
               <p>Mag was puzzled to know what answer was politic.</p>
               <p>"What do you think of all these things?" she asked, at last.</p>
               <p>"They are great evils, of course. And another evil of slavery is, that no marriage
                  among the people here is legal. If slavery is a greater blessing than curse to the
                  blacks—and that is the southern theory, that the brutal wretches of Africa were
                  brought out of their cannibalism into Christianity by slavery—yet this arrangement
                  about marriage with them needs reformation. Bad as the case is, there is as much
                  fidelity in marriage among the blacks as among the whites, north or south. There
                  is more of chastity south than in northern cities. That is southern
                  sentiment—conscientious southern sentiment, too."</p>
               <p>The three thought silently for a time, and the doctor went on—</p>
               <p>"No nation, or race of people, can bear freedom, without education. The Israelites
                  in barbarism preferred slavery to the hardships of freedom. The ignorant Jacobin
                  mob of France tried freedom till they deluged the land with blood, and could only
                  be kept from licentious anarchy by a sceptre of iron in the hands of their master,
                  Napoleon. France can never be free from despotism till her lower classes can be
                  educated—a large majority of them cannot even read. Freedom in Hayti has proved a
                  failure. England is anxious in her heart to find for it a master. What this last
                  revolution will do for Hayti, time will tell. Whether republicanism in America is
                  more than an experiment, the education and enlightenment of the masses alone will
                  determine. And the enslaved ignorance of Europe pouring into our country, is
                  mingling foul elements for freedom to operate upon! Education is freedom!"</p>
               <p>"Slavery is a difficult problem," said Mag. She was thinking of the hopeful
                  condition of that legislature whose three members could not spell, and the
                  thirteen 'men of <emph>mark</emph>' in the legislature of Texas.</p>
               <p>"Yes; without education, freedom is a curse to any people—and these blacks cannot
                  be educated here; it would produce insurrection, anarchy, and horror past
                  description. In <emph>self-defence,</emph> masters are obliged to keep their
                  servants in ignorance. Yet it is only the white blood mixed with the African, that
                  makes the element dangerous. The pure African blood is sluggish."</p>
               <p>"Anti-slavery men say otherwise."</p>
               <p>"There are exceptions to all general rules. They judge the rule by the exceptions.
                  We know that the exceptions prove the rule. We never put the pure African race to
                  learning mechanics—they very rarely can do it. All our mechanics are mulattoes.
                  The white blood gives the energy and intellect. We know it."</p>
               <p>Mag was silent.</p>
               <p>"No, no. Slavery is here. Whether a curse or a blessing to white or black, as far
                  as human foresight can predict, here it must stay! I solemnly believe it is a
                  greater curse to the whites than to the blacks. It enervates the young in both
                  physical and intellectual energy. A woman at the South is never developed in
                  energy; she depends upon her fathers and brothers for support. It is as rare as a
                  miracle for a southern girl to depend upon herself as three-fourths of all you
                  northern girls do. There is no use in denying it, literature and education is of a
                  much lower grade at the South than at the North, and it is one of the results of
                  slavery."</p>
               <p>"Will England introduce slavery into India?"</p>
               <p>"England has a great desire to do it, on account of the cotton crops of India.</p>
               <p>"You have discussed the subject sufficiently for once," said Mrs. Hudson. "We must
                  get up a deer hunt for Miss Mag to-morrow. If we are not fortunate enough to start
                  a deer, at least we can have a famous ride."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said the doctor, "Henson will go with us, and we will send to Major Erwin
                  to come with Mrs. Erwin and bring his pack of hounds."</p>
               <pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC6426-00000167"/>
               <p>Mag's heart gave a sudden throb that nearly choked her, at mention of a
                  name—"Major Erwin!" Strange, what spell lies in a name!</p>
               <p>The next day, Major Erwin sent his hounds, with regrets that the sickness of his
                  child would prevent Mrs. Erwin and himself from attending the hunt.</p>
               <p>They rode for miles into the forests, and when they came to the "deer run," Mag
                  took her stand with Dr. Hudson, while Mrs. Hudson went with Henson, who was one of
                  the students at the Institute.</p>
               <p>Mag and the doctor discussed innumerable things, of course, while waiting for the
                  hounds to "open," whenever they should start a deer. They heard the hounds at
                  intervals—an interrupted baying.</p>
               <p>"I don't listen to any of that sort of talk," said the doctor, as he listened. "No
                  deer yet, certain. When Tiger opens, we shall hear music that <emph>means</emph>
                  something. I believe you shoot, Miss Mag. It will be worth while if you kill a
                  deer to-day."</p>
               <p>"I have never practised much except with pistols, and I should be too much excited
                  to attempt with a gun at a deer—it must be very fascinating—but I will not attempt
                  today. I have never seen deer enough to want to shoot the first one that goes
                  bounding by."</p>
               <p>"There goes Tiger!" said the doctor, as a deep bay inspired the air. "Now, listen
                  for music!" The hounds commenced a full cry. Mag's blood tingled—her fingers ached
                  to get hold of the gun. But the hounds ceased the chorus suddenly.</p>
               <p>"What can it mean?" said the doctor. "I never knew Tiger to make a mistake! They
                  are on track of something, but it is not a deer yet. Then the music never stops
                  till the death, and that will be when just through yonder you see a deer leaping
                  for life. There is nothing under heaven so graceful as the bound of a deer! There
                  they go again! No! Tiger is not sure of the game!"</p>
               <p>"How do you know Tiger's voice?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, a hunter always knows the voices of his dogs as well as he knows the faces of
                  his children," said Dr. Hudson.</p>
               <p>"There goes Tiger again! And it is not a deer—it is a wild-cat! A deer would have
                  passed here before now, but there is no accounting for the tricks of a wild-cat.
                  The dogs can't track one—he dodges, and sneaks, and climbs trees, and makes
                  perfect fools of the hounds."</p>
               <p>Here a servant made his appearance, in great haste.</p>
               <p>"Major Erwin says please come over dar, right quick—his baby mi'ty sick, Master
                  William!"</p>
               <p>"Yes; tell the boy I will be there directly. I can't leave you here, Miss
                  Barclay."</p>
               <p>That name had again paralyzed the blood in Mag's pulses, yet she did not dare
                  permit her tongue to ask if it was Major Guy Erwin.</p>
               <p>"Let me go home with you, Dr. Hudson," she said.</p>
               <p>"And home she went, and seated herself in the largest arm-chair, and tried to hush
                  the palpitation of her heart, but she felt sick and faint. She tried to laugh at
                  herself, and did wish she was asleep, but her heart palpitated on.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hudson stayed with Mr. Henson, to see the hunt out. At night they brought
                  home a wild-cat of enormous size.</p>
               <p>This was Mag's first hunt in the Southwest, and this her first experience of the
                  far-famed southern hospitality. She saw it in other guises afterward.</p>

               <head>XXVI. CHANGES OF THE MOON.</head>
               <p>"YOU must go with me, Puss, to see Mrs. Erwin," said the doctor, when he returned.
                  "That child is going to die, and she is nearly frantic."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hudson glanced towards Mag.</p>
               <p>"Never think of me! I will stay with mammy to-night, and play housekeeper till you
                  return. I shall enjoy the solitude."</p>
               <p>She was glad to be left alone. She was a coward then, though nothing in earth or
                  air did she fear. She thought she dared look in at the mouth of the pit, and laugh
                  at the gambols of the demons. Had she not once met the archfiend himself, in the
                  form of an angel? God sent her to him in answer to prayer! Had she not dared him
                  to her terms, with her eye fastened on his wavering eye, and her finger upon the
                  trigger of a revolver? She had learned then a<pb n="334-335"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000168"/> lesson for all future time. If answers to prayer
                  must lead her past a yawning hell, where God failed her and Satan came, she would
                  never fail herself. Henceforth she would trust herself first, and God last; she
                  was sure of herself—she was not sure of a God. Henceforth works must come before
                  faith. She must work out her salvation—perhaps with fear and trembling, yet if the
                  Bible was a splendid lie, and there was no God, as she sometimes thought, what
                  could there be to fear? Why not, for one hour, one day, one week of rapture,
                  barter herself to Charles Moore in marriage, and when sated with bliss, when they
                  had drained the goblet to the lees, as all of earth who knew joy did, when the
                  rapture was paling at the dregs, why not then escape into the Great Unknown?</p>
               <p>Mag had some odd ideas about the exhaustive nature of joy; but there were gleams
                  of truth in them. Happiness is an art.</p>
               <p>She opened a copy of "Mustang Gray," lying upon the table. She read Jere Clemens'
                  opinion of men and things in the preface, and it made her brave in that hour of
                  temptation; it made her cautious—her reckless or fearless moods were wanting in
                  caution—in them she said, and did, and learned daring things that few women are
                  tempted to know—well for them that they are not. Life was teaching her some
                  lessons that it had taught that man of the world, Jere Clemens. She turned the
                  pages, and her eye caught stray sentences: "Long intercourse with a treacherous
                  race had made suspicion a virtue." And again: "Who has not reasoned of things he
                  would shudder to reveal? If there be any such, let him kneel in his closet and
                  thank God, not that he is better than others, but that he has been less severely
                  tried." "I will shake hands with you on that sentiment, Mr. Clemens," said Mag to
                  herself. And again: "That virtue is strongest which is least tempted." "I disagree
                  with you there, sir," said Mag; "that virtue is strongest which has overcome
                  temptation." She closed the pages, and acknowledged herself a coward. She dared
                  not ask Dr. Hudson if that sick child was the child of Guy and Lizzy Erwin. Her
                  tongue rebelled when she commanded it to do that service.</p>
               <p>So she stayed alone with her aroused passions of longing, that for a long,
                  desperate year she had controlled with curb and spur, lashing them into obedience
                  when they had dared utter pitiful complaints, amid starvation of mind, soul and
                  flesh. She was alone with those utter longings now, and gave them loose rein; she
                  dallied with her temptation—for all temptation is in the heart. If we drive
                  thought away, we shall never be tempted beyond refuge. She resolved to tighten the
                  rein when she felt herself going mad. Many souls on earth would go mad, if they
                  yielded their thought to the memories of wrong, and passion, and sorrow that earth
                  has taught them.</p>
               <p>"If God would not take care of her, for the present she would take care of
                  herself; not <emph>yet</emph> would she throw herself into the abyss whence there
                  was no return. She could wait and eat sorrow longer yet."</p>
               <p>It would be a relief, an amusement to get tidings from the world beyond those
                  Frontiers. Of all the untold millions thronging the world, she never should speak
                  with more than a hundred; but it would interest her to hear from the million, and
                  it was nearly time for Wat to return from the post office—it was ten miles away,
                  but Dr. Hudson had sent him for her. Late at night he returned, and brought
                  letters that recalled her wandering senses. The first she read was from Alec Ross.
                  Uncle Alph had died of fever, and would fret no more on earth.</p>
               <p>Well, it gave her a motive for living. It is not much of a motive to work for a
                  self alone, especially when one cares not what becomes of self. Thank fate, she
                  could send Aunt Lina some money. She would divide with her to the last. Aunt Lina
                  now would manage business affairs, too, and it would be more home-like in
                  Glenlyn.</p>

               <p>The next day the doctor and Mrs. Hudson returned. The child was dead. The mother
                  had held her only child in her arms, watching its agony in speechless horror, or
                  imploring the doctor, for Christ's sake, to do something for her baby, wondering,
                  too, why God could let it suffer so—praying frantically that he would only let her
                  suffer in the place of the child. The spasms had passed away at last, and left as
                  their work a dead child in a young mother's arms. And the mother, with the soft,
                  devout look that the Madonna might have worn, when she received the Christ into
                  her arms, then straightened those beautifully molded limbs, calling it fondly by
                  all its pet names, "her young birdling, her darling, her wild falcon, her pet
                  eagle, her Charlie!"—thanking God too, that he would never, never, never, suffer
                  so terribly again; yet refusing to be comforted, because her child was not! It was
                  so hard, so bitter hard, to lay such glorious loveliness out into a lonely
                  grave!</p>
               <p>Mag went with them to the burial.</p>
               <p>It was a rude forest scene—a grove of young oaks, and one small open grave. The
                  sunset rays were slanting beneath the trees before the parents could force
                  themselves to lay away their priceless treasure. The kind-hearted neighbors who
                  had gathered there were seated in groups under the trees waiting. Mrs. Hudson and
                  Mag sat on a low seat near the open grave. At last a carriage drove up, followed
                  by a large group of servants. Mag's soul was in her wide eyes as she looked—unable
                  to move a limb. The carriage contained a noble-looking man, a lady closely veiled,
                  and the coffin of the child. The gentleman lifted the half-fainting lady from the
                  carriage, while a few of the servants took up the little coffin, and placed it by
                  the side of the grave. The servants broke into a wail. The neighbors rose as the
                  carriage drove up. Mag, sick through heart and soul, had drawn down her black
                  veil, and Mrs. Hudson was still sitting by her, when the grief-stricken mother,
                  seeing her friend, came, with her ungoverned southern impulse, and threw herself
                  kneeling at Mrs. Hudson's feet, burying her face in her hands upon her lap, and
                  sobbing in passionate sorrow:</p>
               <p>"My baby! My beautiful baby! My sweet little Charlie!"</p>
               <p>Yes, it was Lizzy Erwin, and that tall, athletic man, whose whole frame was
                  convulsed and shaken at the sight of her sorrow as well as his own—that man,
                  leaning against the strong oak because his own robust strength was unnerved, that
                  was Guy Erwin.</p>
               <p>And Mag, in her soul, envied them—coveted their sorrow—madly was breaking the
                  first and last commandments, and wishing in her deepest soul that she could lie
                  down in that grave, if loving human tears from any of earth could fall for her!
                  Why had not God permitted her to sleep when a baby, in an innocent, passionless
                  grave, while a father and mother yet loved her? The tempter was with her then, and
                  she would almost have bartered her soul for one hour of human love like that of
                  Guy and Lizzie Erwin. If mortals have never met such an hour of passionate sorrow,
                  let them "go down on their knees and thank God, not that they are better than
                  others, but that they have been less severely tried."</p>
               <p>Lizzie ran on in her wild woe, and a long, loud wail rung on the air, as the
                  servants saw the agony of their mistress.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Mary Hudson! why did God take my baby? What shall I do? What can I do? I
                  cannot have it so! I cannot leave my little Charlie alone in these wild woods,
                  with the winds and the rain and the cold night. Alone! alone! forever alone! my
                  birdling! my baby! my beautiful! Oh, why did God do it?"</p>
               <p>Mary Hudson was sobbing passionately and could not tell her why. Another voice, in
                  which was no sob, but a tone like that of hope and gladness, soothed her.</p>
               <p>"God has done it, dear lady, because he loved the boy so dearly! God has done it
                  in mercy, not in judgment. God has carried the baby to his own glorious home.
                  Charlie has gone home. God loves him and you better than you love your baby. He
                  will never be broken-hearted for love in his new home, will never learn another
                  lesson of pain, will never know misery and anguish, will never, like his mother,
                  worship idols with a passion that may lead to ruin and despair. God loves that
                  mother's darling with a love better than the mother's love; out of that fond<pb
                     n="338-339" xml:id="VAC6426-00000170"/> Father's arms the baby is now looking
                  down upon his mother's great grief, with a great yearning love; and the Father's
                  loving heart yearns for her too. Charlie sorrows now only for his mother's wild,
                  earth-born sorrow; her eyes are dim, and she does not see her boy; she will never
                  see him in sin and sorrow again, but she will surely see him again at last. When
                  he visits her now, it will be by a sweet presence, inviting and guiding her to
                  purity and happiness. God the Father loves the mother and her child with a love
                  greater than her soul can conceive, even in its most far-reaching depths of
                  passion and worship."</p>
               <p>Not that Mag believed a word she said. An icy mist enveloped her heart, the heart
                  that she said so often had been trampled into a New England grave. There was a
                  grave in that heart, too. Had she not buried there her first born, her beautiful,
                  a thousand times more beautiful than the first-born sleeping by that grave? Its
                  radiance was blushing sweet as heaven, when she tore open her heart of flesh and
                  laid it in its grave. She, too, had been a Madonna. What maiden has not, who has
                  truly worshipped? She had watched a death agony alone in the wilderness, and was
                  the angel of His presence there to save her?</p>
               <p>Warm fingers clasped hers caressingly as she went on; those music words were
                  soothing, whether or not they contained truth. Even if every word was false, there
                  was nothing else to say—no other message in the universe to comfort a mother for
                  the death-agony of her child.</p>
               <p>Not that Mag thought Lizzy would believe her words, for when did ever a young
                  heart bleeding beneath the stroke of Providence, believe that the stroke was given
                  in love?</p>
               <p>Guy Erwin came and stood by them.</p>
               <p>"Come, Lizzy, let us go and see Charlie."</p>
               <p>He lifted her to his side, and together they stood by the side of that little
                  coffin; together they bent over the little, smiling sleeper, each knelt and kissed
                  the marble brow and eyes and lips, for they loved the sleeper as they loved their
                  own souls—a part of their own life had gone with the life of their boy.</p>
               <p>Mag envied them madly then—her horror had come upon her alone. Her veil was thrown
                  back, and the sad soul was radiating from those mournful, tearless eyes, when
                  Lizzy caught the look, and astonishment broke in upon her great grief.</p>
               <p>"Magdalene Barclay! How came you here?"</p>
               <p>"God knows! I cannot tell! But I am breaking my heart over your sorrow, Lizzy, and
                  would comfort you!"</p>
               <p>"I need you! You must go home with us now!" She turned—" Guy Erwin, this is
                  Magdalene Barclay!"</p>
               <p>And Mag went home with them, and her presence comforted them, and they comforted
                  her, till on that restless night, after the long years of desperation, in which
                  her energies had worked with mad strength, it seemed that she was resting in
                  heaven.</p>
               <p>She had not yet been tempted beyond refuge.</p>
               <p>That night of restless peace! Again and again she probed her heart and questioned
                  her conscience. Had she done wrong with Charles Atherton Moore? Her conscience
                  told her, no. Her every thought for him had been pure. She took the precious
                  unction to her soul, that she had a clean, pure, fresh, unspotted conscience. She
                  had in her life taken false steps that had to be retraced. With Charles Moore she
                  had been true to her pure instincts. The result was—what? She shuddered as she
                  thought. With her book, too, she had taken false steps—they had led her past the
                  doors of perdition—but those steps were taken when God was directing her path, in
                  answer to prayer. How she grieved over that! Her whole nature had poured itself at
                  that time in prayer! A sweet faith, like her olden child faith, had visited her,
                  and urged her onward! She had fulfilled the conditions—acknowledged God in devious
                  ways, and he most certainly was "directing her paths." Again and again she
                  shuddered at the thought of the pollution, up to which that prayer had led her;
                  with sacrilege she thought, that if there was a God, she could never forgive him
                  for "directing" her there. Where had been her error? She had followed her pure
                  instincts, followed blindly the Bible faith, and the result was———. She could not
                  frame language for her thought. She slept at last, and dreamed of Frank and
                  Charlie, and heaven was in her dreams.</p>
               <p>She waked in the morning, bewildered to find herself in the home of Lizzy Erwin.
                  It was a newly-furnished, elegant cottage. Lizzy herself had hardly become
                  acquainted with its suite of rooms, having but just returned from Huntsville with
                  little Charlie.</p>
               <p>"What Providence sent you into this heathen-land?" asked Guy.</p>
               <pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC6426-00000171"/>
               <p>"I came to teach the heathen."</p>
               <p>"You must have a taste for martyrdom. Well, they need civilizing, God knows. They
                  are the best-hearted people in the world, but their ways are not your ways, and it
                  must be death to you to adapt yourself to them."</p>
               <p>"They would not thank you for your opinion of them."</p>
               <p>"You are certainly casting your pearls before swine in that school. The Book says
                  the swine will turn again and rend you."</p>
               <p>"On the supposition that my talents are pearls. I had flattered myself they were
                  diamonds, that would shine even when thrown into filth and trampled down. But it
                  is somewhat audacious in you to call my companions swine."</p>
               <p>Mag, however, thought of her companions, the pigs.</p>
               <p>"Do not flatter yourself that your associates will recognize your talents as
                  diamonds. Carlyle says that only a hero can recognize a hero. People must have
                  both eyes and light to know the beautiful. What light has Mrs. Peters to
                  appreciate your cultivation? What idea of honor has Judge Jacobs, to recognize
                  truth, purity or fervor in you? He is as unscrupulous, even in business
                  transactions, as Satan could demand. You have certainly mistaken your
                  mission."</p>
               <p>Mag thought again of the special Providence directing her every footstep, and the
                  "Not a sparrow falls without him."</p>
               <p>"What mission would you propose?" asked Mag.</p>
               <p>"Come here and teach Lizzy and me. We have an independent kingdom here. We need
                  you. It will be sinful for you to refuse to come and comfort us. Do you not like
                  the Institution well enough to make it your home?"</p>
               <p>"It is Paradise here."</p>
               <p>"The angel has left it," said Lizzy.</p>
               <p>"Gone, to a better Paradise, Puss," said Guy. And they all reverized solemnly.</p>
               <p>"I have been a thoughtless reprobate," said Guy, at last. "The hereafter has never
                  concerned me much. I found enough to interest me in the present; but little
                  Charlie has taken my heart with him wherever he has gone. It is for my interest
                  now to believe in guardian angels; and the Bible says that angels are ministering
                  spirits. I shall endeavor to believe it, and it will not be difficult to believe
                  now."</p>
               <p>But it was difficult for Mag to believe. She did not wonder that Guy, with every
                  earthly good in his grasp, physical and intellectual wealth, the wealth of love
                  and fortune tune—she did not wonder that it was easy for him to believe that a
                  kind Providence was watching him—but what was God doing with her? Yet in all her
                  poverty and orphanage, she never could see the moment when she would exchange her
                  personal identity for that of Lizzy Erwin, whom she envied, which was a wise
                  arrangement of Providence.</p>
               <p>"Yes, this is a pleasant home of ours. Why will you not stay with us?" asked Guy
                  again, one day. "Pride prevents you. Remember, by pride the angels fell."</p>
               <p>"And 'Pride goeth before destruction'—it has marred my life."</p>
               <p>"If you will martyr yourself by teaching"——</p>
               <p>Mag thought of Aunt Lina, and concluded she must.</p>
               <p>"Do get a decent situation—at least one where you can have some of the necessaries
                  of life."</p>
               <p>Mag "had no objections to improving her condition if she could do it without
                  sacrificing her independence."</p>
               <p>"Independence! Heaven help us! Have you run away with the blessed idea that there
                  is such a thing as independence on earth?</p>
               <p>"We are all slaves to circumstances, even when we most control them. The chief
                  slave in these United States is that old gentleman, James Buchanan, who longs for
                  the time to come when he may lay off his chains. The first slaves in France are
                  Louis Napoleon and his empress, the fascinating Eugenie! How they do exert
                  themselves to amuse their masters—the populace—who otherwise might amuse
                  themselves by tearing them from thrones. Independence! Nonsense! Come and teach
                  Lizzy and myself. We will give you a better salary than you are receiving. By the
                  by, this house is neatly finished to be done entirely by servants."</p>
               <p>"Yes, thank you," said Mag, laughing. "But there is such a spirit as liberty. One
                  writer says, 'At times she takes the form of a hateful reptile. She grovels, she
                  hisses, she stings. But woe to those who, in disgust, shall venture to crush her.
                  And happy are those who, having dared to receive her in her degraded and frightful
                  shape, shall at length be rewarded by her in the time of her beauty and
                  glory.'"</p>
               <p>"Do you represent that spirit of liberty?"</p>
               <p>"If so you have recognized the spirit in its degraded form, and have honored it,
                  you have not crushed it."</p>
               <pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC6426-00000172"/>
               <p>"Has any one dared to trample upon it?"</p>
               <p>"Only one Christian man, to whom I was directed by God, in answer to prayer. The
                  spirit of liberty represented itself to him as a stranger in poverty and
                  orphanage, and merely asked aid. It wanted employment, that it might rise to its
                  own sphere among its own kindred, and that Christian man ruthlessly trampled upon
                  the proud, degraded spirit, and tried to fling upon it the worst pollution he
                  could find on earth."</p>
               <p>"In the time of that spirit's glory, woe to him who in scorn ventured to insult
                  and crush its pride and purity, in the days of its degradation!" said Guy.</p>
               <p>"Revenge is a delicious momentary morsel—it leaves a taste of intense bitterness.
                  Hatred and revenge work out their own curse in the hearts that harbor them. We
                  need not go to the Bible to learn that. 'Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord.'
                  Revenge when cherished, develops the spirit of evil in man, and educates him for a
                  fiend. I have tremendous capacities for hating, but from purely selfish motives I
                  must annihilate them. Moreover, most objects are beneath hatred—the soul cannot
                  bend itself to hate what is beneath it—only a noble being is worthy of hatred or
                  revenge, and the noble never inspire hatred. That Christian man is safe from my
                  revenge—his name will never be revealed by me."</p>
               <p>"You are coming to some curious logic."</p>
               <p>"It is not logic, it is truth. The Bible recognizes and commands it. 'Be not
                  overcome with evil, but overcome evil with good.'"</p>
               <p>"So you devote yourself to loving your enemies with a vengeance. You will coin
                  your life into blessings upon your enemies. That you call the spirit of
                  Christianity? It is a splendid theory."</p>
               <p>"With me the virtue is all taken away; it is all selfishness; I refrain from
                  revenge to purify myself, not to do good to my enemy."</p>
               <p>"What a sensible little soul you are!"</p>
               <p>"What was your remark about building this house—it was connected with the subject
                  of independence?"</p>
               <p>"I gave the head carpenter and his wife their freedom for his building it; they
                  were mulattoes; I tried to send them to Liberia, to inhale the blessed air of
                  liberty."</p>
               <p>"Did they not go?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing could induce them to leave America. They were born here—their friends
                  here—and they must stay here. They went to Mobile, however; but it is against the
                  laws of Alabama for a negro to be free, so I am obliged to be their guardian. They
                  come home here every Christmas and take their independence with the negroes at the
                  Quarters." Guy turned to Lizzy—"Miss Mag has concluded at last to stay with us and
                  teach us liberty and Christianity. We all intend to grow powerfully in the
                  graces."</p>
               <p>"All except the <emph>conclusion,</emph>" added Mag.</p>
               <p>"The screw is loose yet in her life-philosophy. I regret it more than I can tell,"
                  said Guy.</p>
               <p>They spent the days in riding, hunting, fishing, or with reading music, and games.
                  Charles Moore's name was often mentioned, but never by Mag. Guy came from the
                  post-office one day.</p>
               <p>"No letter from brother to-day?" asked Lizzy.</p>
               <p>He shook his head sadly.</p>
               <p>"What can the wild boy be doing in India and China? I am really famishing to hear
                  from my brother. Please, Mag, permit me to ask if you hear from Charlie?"</p>
               <p>Mag's face paled; her fingers shook with a nervous tremor as they lay palsying
                  upon the book in her lap.</p>
               <p>"Never."</p>
               <p>Lizzy went on wickedly—some perverse spirit must have impelled her—"He wrote from
                  Smyrna last—had been to the ruins of Nineveh—had seen the monument to Jonah—proof
                  of the truth of Bible prophecy, he said—sent us some blocks of marble with curious
                  inscriptions from Nineveh—but wrote in his wild way that he was starting on a
                  chase for an old gentleman, who, they said, carried a scythe and was called
                  Death—he was going to hunt the world over for him—Death and Love were together
                  somewhere—the old man had forgotten to look grim, and was playing the sly,
                  avoiding him, with as many graces in his arms as a coquette or a New England
                  flirt—he himself was paying his addresses to the Death, urging his suit with as
                  much passion and fervor as a boy in his first, mad, foolish love. He had found
                  that he must be cured of many follies before Death would grant his embraces; he
                  must be worthy of a bride before he could win her, and God knew his bride must be
                  worthy before another wooing; and worthy of Death, before he would grant favors
                  and the embraces of a marriage in the great Hereafter."</p>
               <p>Mag's face grew whiter and more ghastly as Lizzy went<pb n="344-345"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000173"/> on, and as she finished, she accomplished the feat
                  of fainting entirely.</p>
               <p>Guy and Lizzy, of course, half drowned her with water, half strangled her with
                  cologne and ammonia, and so she recovered her senses.</p>
               <p>"I beg your pardon, Lizzy," said she, as soon as she could move her tongue; "it
                  was an accident; I did not intend to get sick; it was an unpardonably foolish
                  mistake of mine. I will promise not to do it again;" and Mag smiled.</p>
               <p>"Please to lie still and behave yourself until you are able to move," Guy
                  commanded; and as Mag just then could not move, she was forced to obey.</p>
               <p>The vacation ended, and she went back to her mission. She carried with her now a
                  remorseful pain, that gnawed at her heart and would not be appeased. She never
                  again was proud of her "fresh, clean, pure conscience—such a glorious thing!" Her
                  conscience turned traitor and upbraided her now; she did not mind hunger and
                  physical want now; she paled over a deeper thirst, the approval of that
                  conscience. Through her, Charles Moore had lost faith in her sex; through her, he
                  had doubted the honor of womanhood. From all she could learn of him, he believed
                  that she had willfully betrayed him—had deceived the nobility of his nature, and
                  he was giving himself up to evil. A man could do that and redeem himself; for a
                  woman who took one false step, there was no redemption. Because one woman had
                  betrayed him, he would ruthlessly betray the order, whenever he could so amuse an
                  idle hour. It was now an amusement to finger the secret chords of human hearts,
                  even when the responsive notes were all of wailing. How many a man has done the
                  same!</p>
               <p>"I <emph>must</emph> have reached the bottom of the abyss at last," she said. "I
                  thought long ago I had sounded its lowest depths. All is certainly lost now—there
                  can be nothing more to lose. May outraged womanhood pardon me the wrong I have
                  done! No, there can be no lower depths."</p>
               <p>But there were lower depths. When she had reached the bottom of the abyss, there
                  was nothing to do but rise again; and her time had not yet come.</p>
               <p>She began to mistrust, from the lashings of that unquiet conscience, that a God
                  had appointed a judge and jury to sit in condemnation of her self-deceiving pride.
                  God was permitting her freely "to work out her own destiny," to "make her own
                  fate." She was controlling circumstances, yet was she a slave to circumstances.
                  The materials of her destiny had been given her—glorious physical, mental and
                  moral strength. Charles Moore had told her that ages ago, on one moonlight night,
                  and told her it was her duty to make herself a <emph>perfect woman.</emph> Had
                  she, indeed, as she boasted to herself, cultivated her talents to the very
                  utmost—done with her might all her hands found to do? She had been busy and
                  earnest, night and day, and never knowingly had violated her conscience. Had she
                  been doing wrong all her life? God alone knew—if there was indeed a God. Yes, she
                  must test him; she must know whether there was any power for good in faith. Once
                  more she determined to go to him, and this time it should be for life or death. He
                  had promised in his word that faith should be all-powerful. It had once failed her
                  terribly. The God in Christ had said, "<emph>Whatsoever</emph> ye ask in my name,
                  I will give it." Now it should be life or death forever.</p>
               <p>The domestic affairs at Mr. Church's were in a sad condition also; there had
                  always been anarchy in the kitchen; and the rebellion had come to a crisis one
                  day, for it had declared itself in the following emphatic language. Their cook
                  went to the "mistis" one day, in great wrath:</p>
               <p>"I 'clar, I jest can't cook nothin' decent, with sich a lot o' lazy niggers
                  clutterin' up the fire! I won't try to do it! My mistis wouldn't 'low no sich
                  works! Six of us, all eatin' and sleepin' in this one room—cooking for white folks
                  and niggers too!"</p>
               <p>"Which impidence," the indignant mistress told Mag, "she jest knowed I wasn't
                  goin' to stand! Great, lazy, good-for-nothin' hussy! I took the cowhide and
                  whipped her, till I couldn't lift my arm; she stood stock still too, as meek as if
                  she had been a child o' Moses, and I could feel every lick, as if I was hittin' a
                  log."</p>
               <p>Mag thought "pity it had not been a log!"</p>
               <p>"And jest as soon as I had done it," continued the lady, "do you think, the
                  impertinent white nigger turned on her heel, picked up her two young 'uns, and, in
                  spite of me, went straight home to her master; and her master took up for her, and
                  wouldn't let her come back! My husband was mad good about it, I tell you! Think of
                  a great, strappin' mulatto walkin' over white folks like that!"</p>
               <p>The new cook was a boy, Jacob, a steamboat hand, but he found himself in Aunt
                  Fanny's multifold troubles, minus some babies; and sent on the table about the
                  same amount<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC6426-00000174"/> of abominations. Mrs.
                  White, poor woman, found herself unequal to the control of her kingdom, like
                  Richard Cromwell, but, unlike him, she could not decline the sceptre, which, in
                  her case, was a cowhide, and all suffered for it.</p>
               <p>"They say every one must eat a peck of dirt in a lifetime, and I am cultivating my
                  taste for it. There is nothing like getting accustomed to a thing! When the
                  'seasonin'' is mostly wool, why all one has to do is to close one's eyes—and then
                  one's mouth—it is soon over!" said Mr. Church.</p>
               <p>School affairs went on famously for a time, until Mrs. Church was taken sick, in
                  consequence of having slept several nights with the rain pouring on her bed.</p>
               <p>Mag had the whole school upon her hands again; it was at an unfortunate time
                  too—just before the grand examinations.</p>
               <p>By dint of work from daylight till midnight, she drilled the classes, wrote plays
                  for rehearsals, was manager of the theatricals, teacher of elocution, and
                  conductor of the music for the concert, and again the finale was a triumph.
                  Students of the Male Institute were pressed into her service, in this time that
                  tried women's souls; for a reward, she promised to teach them the fitting and
                  beautiful, in the wonderful mysteries of human hearts.</p>
               <p>But summer came again, and fleas, and lizards, and snakes, and pigs. And Mag saw
                  the varieties of life in consequence, and learned lessons of philosophy, which
                  were very valuable, and so did the boys of the Male Institute, and the Hon. Board
                  of Trustees—and so may all creation who wish to read their experience here. If it
                  was not a romantic experience, it was at least true. Like Johnson's celebrated
                  doggerel, it contained more truth than poetry.</p>
               <p>On account of the burning summer heat, the pigs, in looking for a cool and shady
                  retreat, discovered it under the Male Institute. They took up their summer
                  residence there! the fleas accompanied them, of course, but had higher
                  aspirations, and ascended, taking lodgings in the boys' pants, which, being
                  already occupied, there arose a rebellion. When, to rout the invaders, kicking and
                  scratching had been thoroughly tried in vain, the boys, in self-defence, sent some
                  important resolutions to the Hon. Board of Trustees.</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Resolved—That if the Trustees of the Kane Co. Male Institute will
                  not expel the pigs and fleas from the Institution, the school will leave en
                  masse.</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Resolved—That the School will take a holiday, to give the Trustees
                  time for consideration and action upon these important resolutions."</p>
               <p>Mr. Church dispatched the interesting document to the President of the Board, and
                  spent the day with the boys in hunting and fishing.</p>
               <p>The Board immediately met, and took the matter into deep consideration. It was a
                  difficult and delicate piece of work. After mature discussion and deliberation,
                  they resolved to send one of their number with a troop of servants to see the
                  business thoroughly done. This overseer was carefully instructed to drive out the
                  pigs from under the Institution, then to strew over their bed a light layer of
                  pineleaves, to be set into a light blaze, which would burn out the fleas. All of
                  which was faithfully done.</p>
               <p>The fleas were effectually burnt out; the "light blaze" also caught the turpentine
                  of the pine logs, and in one hour every flea had vanished, and the Kane Co.
                  Institute, like ancient "Troy fuit," a heap of ashes, which gave the Board of
                  Trustees matter for further consideration.</p>
               <p>They met immediately thereupon, viewed the ruins, and "resolved" that it was a
                  "special providence"—(which interested Mag, as she was hoping some day to believe
                  in special providences)—which indicated that the building was by no means worthy
                  of the enterprising principal and interesting school. A subscription was instantly
                  on foot, for a new framed Institution; and the old plan of endowing and chartering
                  it for a college was renewed and urged forward. At last, however, the most mature
                  minds concluded to postpone the college to a little more favorable season. The new
                  buildings were mightily enlarged and improved, went up rapidly, and, like the
                  giant Antæus, the Institution gained strength by its fall.</p>
               <p>Having found the moral to this incident, Mag went on her life-journey, conscious,
                  too, of an intolerable pain that was tightening upon her vitals whenever she
                  gained time for thought and feeling. Alone and in darkness, the agony would not be
                  controlled; she wrestled with it, and with remorse, but they would not be
                  conquered, and she had full opportunity of testing that bitter panacea for sorrow,
                  "What cannot be cured, must be endured." She was thankful for the slightest
                  incident that could lull her serpents to forget-fulness for a moment.</p>
               <p>One Sabbath evening she met Aunt Nancy, dressed in<pb n="348-349"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000175"/> her bright scarlet dress and turban, and white
                  apron, on her way to "preachin'."</p>
               <p>The church of the frontiers was a little log-house, where, semi-monthly, the
                  inhabitants, if it was not too hot, or too cold, or too rainy, met to learn their
                  duty to both God and man.</p>
               <p>Aunt Nancy was on her way to a meeting of the colored people. "Uncle Sussex" and
                  "Parson Dan Ray" were to hold forth to their colored brethren.</p>
               <p>"How d'ye, aunty?" was Mag's greeting as she met her.</p>
               <p>"Thank the Lord, I'se mi'ty well, Miss Maggy. How do you enjoy your mind yourself?
                  'Pears to me you're sort o' troubled in mind o' late, and you orter get your
                  foundation 'stablished on the Rock of Ages."</p>
               <p>Mag only wished she could; she had been trying for some time, but she did not tell
                  aunty so.</p>
               <p>"And you are a sure enough church member, aunty?"</p>
               <p>"Thank the Lord, honey, I'se been a member of the Baptist Church a great many
                  year."</p>
               <p>"The Baptist Church? Then you thought you would take a 'through ticket' to the New
                  Jerusalem! You can't 'fall from grace' in that church."</p>
               <p>"Dunno 'bout that, Miss Maggy. I 'sisted on g'wine to the Lord's Table in the
                  Methodist Church one day, and they tole me they should turn me out of the Baptist
                  Church if I did it again; and I couldn't see what it all meant. Both are gwine to
                  the same heaven, I s'pose; 'case I didn't feel right about it, I thought I'd jine
                  the Methodist Church too, and commune in both churches, but I must have fell from
                  grace, for now they won't let me commune in the Baptist Church."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you did not have any grace to fall from." Mag thought of all Aunt Nancy's
                  iniquities at Judge Jacobs', and could hardly forgive the filth she had served up
                  for table use. Mag thought cleanliness ought to be a part of religion—it was one
                  of the graces.</p>
               <p>"At least you have a 'free pass' to all the other denominations. Don't you think
                  something could be done for me, aunty?"</p>
               <p>"There's no tellin' what the Lord will do for you. You may get religion ef you'll
                  go to meetin'."</p>
               <p>And Mag went on with Aunt Nancy to "meetin'." Aunt Nancy improved the opportunity
                  to exhort her to "make fruit and meat for penitents, and to flee from the 'raf to
                  come." Mag changed the subject. Listening to good advice is difficult, when we
                  have no faith in the advisers; and "preaching" was Aunt Nancy's forte, the
                  "practising" with her was in as forlorn a condition as it was with Mag's friend,
                  the Andover graduate, who considered his preaching all that concerned his
                  congregation.</p>
               <p>"Ain't you afraid of the comet, aunty?"</p>
               <p>"Me 'fraid? No, honey, 'case I'm 'pared to go, when the trumpet sounds. I'm ready
                  and a waitin' for the year o' jubilee to come!"</p>
               <p>"The year of jubilee, aunty? Do you really suppose now that when the comet hits
                  all creation we shall be knocked into the year of jubilee? Really, now, are you
                  never afraid of pitching into fire?"</p>
               <p>"The right sperit ain't got in you, Miss Maggy, or you wouldn't laugh. You won't
                  laugh when you see it a comin'. That ar' comet ain't a goin' to destroy the earth,
                  it is goin' to destroy sin, and ef you don't get sin out o'yer heart, it will get
                  burn in fire."</p>
               <p>Mag half believed that.</p>
               <p>"How do you know, aunty?"</p>
               <p>"It's been 'vealed to me."</p>
               <p>Mag laughed. She remembered Aunt Nancy's revelations of old. There had been a
                  time, when to remedy the kitchen disorders at Judge Jacobs', Molly had been
                  transformed into cook, and Aunt Nancy made washerwoman—the worst possible
                  arrangement. A gentleman visitor was in the house for a week, and one day, like
                  Belshazzar of old, Mr. Fowler's pants were "found wanting"—that is, they turned up
                  missing, and of course aunty was called up for a "revelation" of the mystery. She
                  "'clared 'fore the Lord she jest didn't know whar' they could a gone; she had
                  looked, an' looked, an' looked, an' as sartin as God Almighty was a settin' in
                  heaven, she couldn't find 'em!" The judge told her that "as the Lord was in the
                  habit of 'vealing himself to her, and she was accustomed to receiving powerful
                  answers to prayer, she must just pray up those pants, or"——he hinted alarming
                  anathemas. The next morning, bright and early, Aunt Nancy made her appearance with
                  the pants, saying "she had spent the bressed night in prayer to God Almighty, an'
                  jest at break o' day the Lord had answered her prayer. He directed her outen the
                  yard, and thar' on the ground, the first thing she saw, was them pants a lyin',
                  all washed and ironed."</p>
               <pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC6426-00000176"/>
               <p>Mag did not doubt about Aunt Nancy's special providences.</p>
               <p>As they entered the "meetin'," Parson Dan was holding forth mightily. The spirit
                  was moving him in sundry places. He stamped, danced, and shouted; his gestures
                  were as energetic as those of Rufus Choate, though, instead of tearing his coat,
                  he tore his shirt. He went over as much ground with his understanding as
                  circumstances would possibly allow—taking as wide a circuit as Henry Ward Beecher
                  himself, and using his bandana with about the same effect on his countenance. The
                  whole performance reminded Mag of a description given by one of the "reprobates"
                  of a camp-meeting: "A distracted meeting, in which the exercises were mostly
                  shouting and cavorting."</p>
               <p>Parson Dan seemed also to have the gift of continuance. Uncle Sussex, who sat
                  behind him, concluded at last that he had done and said enough, so he very quietly
                  took hold of Parson Dan's pants behind, and pulled him down into the chair, to let
                  him rest from the workings of the spirit. He sat there, his face buried in his
                  hands, weeping and laughing by turns, and uttering, or rather jerking out at
                  spasmodic intervals: "Glory to God! Glory!" till his emotions were exhausted.</p>
               <p>While he was being relieved of his overplus of feeling, Uncle Sussex took the
                  floor, and lined off a "hime" for the congregation to sing.</p>
               <p>Mag respected Uncle Sussex. Parson Dan was by no means a consistent church member,
                  being addicted to the low vice of stealing, whenever he had opportunity. Uncle
                  Sussex was a venerable, grey-headed mulatto, universally respected by white and
                  black, for his upright, consistent, Christian life. Mag listened with
                  reverence—she always reverenced goodness. His language was correct. The mulattoes
                  are far more correct in their language than the Africans. His manner was solemn
                  and impressive—no passion in his tones. Mag always sickened over uncontrolled
                  emotions under any circumstances. Uncle Alph, in his moods of passion, had taught
                  her utter contempt for any person that did not rule his spirit. Uncle Sussex
                  reminded her of Father McLean, whom she almost worshipped; she listened with all
                  her soul. His subject was a favorite one with the negroes—a description of the
                  heavenly home. He told them of the golden streets, the gates of pearl, the starry
                  crowns, the shining harps to which all would sing. There was a sweet smile on his
                  lip as he described them in subdued tones, and tears rolled silently down his
                  dusky face, as he described the meeting of fathers and mothers, and brothers and
                  sisters, long separated. There was a radiant beauty in Uncle Sussex's face, and
                  Mag knew then how lovely those withered features would look when they formed the
                  face of an angel. And his spirit magnetized the spirits of his listeners; their
                  emotions, like his, were all subdued; their faces were wet with softening tears;
                  they sobbed, but repressed their sobs. Parson Dan himself was subdued, and when
                  Uncle Sussex sat down, he rose, and in a rich, clear, powerful ringing voice,
                  commenced a popular chorus— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"March on! Brethren, march on!</l>
                        <l>For we shall gain the victory!</l>
                        <l>March on! March on! For we shall gain the day!"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It was a wild, sweet strain, and those mellow voices harmonized wonderfully. They
                  varied the time, tune, harmony and words, to suit their wavering emotions,
                  repeating again and again the chorus— <q>
                     <l>"March on! Brethren, march on! For we shall gain the day!"</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Then they all rose as they sang, and as the tears rolled down their cheeks, they
                  walked slowly around shaking hands with each other, and sometimes a soft gush of
                  laughter interrupted the sobs, as some hand dearer than the others met in a
                  clasping embrace.</p>
               <p>Mag sat alone, and watched it all with her wide, earnest, brown eyes—she listened
                  to the swell of the sweet harmony, and it thrilled her nerves strangely. And those
                  dusky faces gathered around her, they saw an inexpressible sorrow in her mournful,
                  tearless eyes, and they told "dear young mistis" there would be no sorrow in
                  heaven—fathers and mothers and all would be there, and no sorrow!</p>
               <p>Aunt Nancy came to her, swaying her tall, Amazon figure backward and forward,
                  keeping time to the wild chorus, and her handsome brown features were pale with
                  emotion.</p>
               <p>Uncle Sussex came. Mag placed her soft hand in his old, hardened, black palm with
                  a real grateful smile; her heart yearned for his blessing; and he gave it. "Dear
                  young mistress," he said, and his voice was tremulous with tenderness<pb
                     n="352-353" xml:id="VAC6426-00000177"/> ness. "Thank God there will be no
                  sorrow in heaven—no tears there—no broken hearts—God will wipe away all tears. Go
                  to him when you are weary and heavy laden and he will give you rest!"</p>
               <p>Mag had been to him, and found mockery. But that slave, with his heavenly pity,
                  poured the balm of healing into Mag's hardened but breaking heart. For a time it
                  became again a heart of flesh; she went on her way humanized, more resigned, more
                  submissive. Sorrow was the lot of all on earth. Her temptation was common. It is
                  the glory of the Christian religion, that it satisfies the wants of the
                     <emph>ignorant</emph>—Philosophy is for the educated alone.</p>
               <p>The next draughts of Lethe and Nepenthe with which she amused the serpents at her
                  vitals, came in another form. She watched the spirit of southern chivalry in a
                  peculiar outbreak in the Institution. It came in a form that she could neither
                  control nor influence, but it was particularly interesting to a girl educated with
                  "northern prejudices."</p>
               <p>Mr. Houston, a northern man—what the southerners called a full-blooded Yankee—had
                  moved into the settlement to take boarders for the Female Institute. The term
                  "Yankee," at the South, expresses the concentration of all the gall in the South,
                  against the North. When any one disliked Mag, they poured out their odium by
                  calling her a "Yankee." To express their approbation, they could find no stronger
                  terms than by saying that "there was not one iota of Yankee blood in her." Mr.
                  Houston was a Yankee colporter in the employ of the American Tract Society; he had
                  a cousin Yankee colporter, and marvellous reports the two were accustomed to send
                  for publication of their efforts among the destitute and ignorant through all
                  these benighted regions of the Southwest.</p>
               <p>They had, however, as Mrs. Partington expresses it, "a thousand winning ways for
                  making themselves hateful." Mrs. Houston was one of the most estimable ladies in
                  the community, universally beloved. No one ever dreamed of calling her a
                  Yankee.</p>
               <p>One of Mr. Houston's "Yankee tricks" was outside of the comprehension of southern
                  education or chivalry. He had taken from the Orphan Asylum at Natchez, a girl of
                  sixteen, who was in his family what, in northern parlance, is termed a "bound
                  girl." That is, he gave bonds to the Asylum, obligating himself to support her
                  till she was eighteen, teach her domestic work, send her to school one term, etc.
                  Her position in the family was dubious. White girls in the South leave domestic
                  work to be done by servants. Southern people could not comprehend what Mr. Houston
                  meant; they gossipped about it, as people will; they got into a fever about it.
                  Was the girl a slave or not? Sometimes she attended school with the boarders, but
                  not often, and she worked with the slaves; the schoolgirls took the gossip in
                  hand, reported it to the victim of persecution, till she grew impertinent and
                  rebellious, and thereupon Mr. Houston gave the white orphan girl of seventeen a
                  severe flogging, which roused all the chivalry in the Southwest against the Yankee
                  colporter.</p>
               <p>Southern men approved of slavery, but not of white slavery. Here was a white
                  orphan girl to be rescued from slavery, law or no law. The girl had a brother
                  somewhere, an undeveloped young soul, but he was sent for, and it was demanded of
                  him that he should demand his sister of her Yankee master. Reluctantly he did it;
                  Mr. Houston refused to give her up until the Orphan Asylum released him from his
                  bonds, promising that she might go then. The refusal was considered another
                  "Yankee trick;" it was like putting fire to powder. The blood of southern chivalry
                  was boiling; it wanted to accomplish something; it must have vent! The trustees
                  instigated the boys of the Male Institute to abduct the girl; the boys thought it
                  was seeing life. The girls of the Female Institute were instructed to abduct the
                  trunks; the girls thought it was mighty funny. Then the affair came to a focus at
                  midnight, which was romantic, and the boys took pistols and things which was
                  valorous. Mr. Houston got wind of the affair, and with his cousin and nephew,
                  garrisoned the log-house with one double-barrelled gun in the hands of the nephew.
                  Operations commenced by one of the dare-devil students riding up to said nephew
                  when he came out with the gun, and telling him, with a shocking oath, which cannot
                  be recorded for a Christian community—to fire, and suffer the consequences—which
                  so alarmed the gallant nephew, that he turned, fled into the house, and sheltered
                  himself behind a convenient, door. Meanwhile, the busy school-girls, being the
                  enemy in the camp, escorted the girl with her trunks to the nearest neighbors, and
                  the valiant school-boys took charge of both.</p>
               <p>Bright and early the next morning, the girl, brother and<pb n="354-355"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000178"/> trunks were placed in a carriage amid the storming
                  anathemas of Mr. Houston, who threatened the whole country with both law and
                  gospel. Three or four students escorted the carriage to Slater's Landing, on the
                  Tombigbee River, with their double-barrelled guns, to keep off the law and
                  officers, whom Mr. Houston tried to send after the girl. Law and officers,
                  however, joined in the rebellion against him. The orphan girl was placed on the
                  steamboat—she was loaded with presents—a purse put in her hand for expenses, and
                  she went, God knows where. Probably—we won't say what we think!</p>
               <p>The next year, the cousin of Mr. Houston was detected "tampering with negroes;"
                  that is, plotting with them to run away with him; he had given up his
                  colportership, and professed himself an infidel. He instantly received a hint from
                  the heads of society that he must leave Mississippi instanter, if he did not wish
                  to be hung by lynch law, or receive as a present a coat of tar and feathers, and a
                  ride on a vehicle yclept a rail. The ex-colporter took the hint and his departure
                  immediately, threatening terrible vengeance as he went. He would write such an
                  abolition book as should make the eyes of community stare, their ears tingle, and
                  their hearts quiver; a book that should cause the institution of slavery to
                  totter, and men and women to tremble in their shoes—especially all those who wore
                  shoes—which threat having never been accomplished, still hangs like a pall or
                  black mantle of doom over Mississippi. Mag thought she would take warning by his
                  sad fate, and never "tamper with negroes."</p>
               <p>Guy Erwin sent for Mag to Rose Hill as often as she would come, which was not
                  often—their kindness turned to torture upon her heart. Guy, as usual, remonstrated
                  on her self-sacrifice, on the sin of her wasting life and talents.</p>
               <p>"If you will be independent, Magdalene Barclay, go and study art. You will confer
                  a favor on me, if you will permit me to furnish you with capital. You shall repay
                  me when you choose."</p>
               <p>To all of which Mag gave her old reply to Charlie. I cannot accept your wonderful
                  kindness, Guy Erwin, because something within me that I cannot disobey, tells me I
                  must not."</p>
               <p>"At least let me get you a situation in a civilized land."</p>
               <p>"Thank you; I will accept that aid with pleasure and gratitude."</p>
               <p>"You shall go to Marion. I will put you under the guardianship of my friend, Dr.
                  Lanier. I will make the arrangements before you die of starvation here."</p>
               <p>A little incident hastened Mag's departure, which we give here, not because it is
                  interesting, but because it shows a curious phase of a business transaction with
                  the board of trustees, and which did not improve Mag's reverence for humanity.</p>
               <p>Mr. Church came to her one day with a dozen confused apologies; he had something
                  unpleasant to tell her—something at least a little provoking, etc., etc.</p>
               <p>The long and the short of it was, that he had been in a difficulty with Capt.
                  Peters—one of the difficulties incident to school-life on the frontiers of the
                  Southwest. One night he had given Joe Peters a right genteel flogging. Joe was the
                  most perfect specimen of a reprobate that was ever bound for the gallows. Mag had
                  passed while he was in the exercise of the rod, and amused herself mightily at the
                  monkey performances of the little wretch, which was very wicked in Mag. Joe
                  thought so, too. He was taking a sort of hornpipe around the floor, making the
                  most rash, reckless and desperate promises of repentance and goodness, with the
                  most eloquent and miraculous contortions of mouth, and pantomime of kicking,
                  scratching and biting when his grimaces were unseen. Joe had gone home and told
                  his father that Mr. Church had nearly murdered him to please Miss Barclay. Mr.
                  Church had received an insulting note from the Captain, saying Miss Barclay's
                  influence in the Male School ought to be repudiated.</p>
               <p>"Poor little Joe!" said the astonished Mag. "Why, all the flogging in Christendom
                  would only cause the iniquity in him to strike deeper. I certainly hope Joe will
                  have as easy a time as possible on earth, for I am afraid he is bound for a hot
                  time hereafter, if there is a hereafter; and fire itself cannot burn out his total
                  depravity. Why, I love the little sinner desperately, he is such a perfect model
                  of wickedness."</p>
               <p>Mr. Church had answered the note according to frontier etiquette. That is, he put
                  the note in his pocket, and a fine bowie-knife in his sleeve, and answered it in
                  propria persona. The Capt. he knew to be a bully, who is always a coward. He told
                  the Capt. that Joe had not received half the flogging that he deserved; that if
                  Joe or the Old Nick had told him it was given at Miss Barclay's instigation, it
                  was a<pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC6426-00000179"/> lie! If the Capt. wanted
                  satisfaction out of him, as he had threatened, he should certainly have it, and of
                  the very kind he wanted, provided he could get it!</p>
               <p>"Well!" ejaculated Mag, as she listened to the details.</p>
               <p>"Well, you have no idea of the amiable expression that stole over the Capt.'s
                  face, like May sunshine. He swallowed his words in the note so fast they would
                  have choked him if his tongue had not been smoother than oil, and we parted with
                  the greatest affability. I was excessively flattered by his appreciation of my
                  extraordinary talents. I am, in his eyes, President in prospectu of the Institute,
                  soon to become a college."</p>
               <p>"Such is life in its most unmitigated forms," commented Mag, as usual, when taking
                  life in the rough.</p>
               <p>"But the point is not yet. Pity that Joe told that tale on you! Don't be alarmed,
                  all things are straightened for you." But he handed her an official document,
                  which Mag read, and her face flushed. She returned it in silence. It was a list of
                  "Resolutions" from the enterprising Board, complimentary to the Institution,
                  ending with a suggestion that Miss Barclay's place be supplied by a southern
                  teacher.</p>
               <p>"I called a meeting of the Board immediately," said Mr. Church. "The Captain was
                  absent, and not another member of the Board knew anything of the clause concerning
                  Miss Barclay. The Capt. had manufactured it to show his own appreciation of the
                  lady. The Board 'resolved' to punish his audacity—also 'resolved' that Miss
                  Barclay was a lady of uncommon genius, and a superior teacher, whose place could
                  not be supplied by any other teacher North or South. So much for your laughing at
                  Joe's misfortunes! You should always sympathize with sorrow if you expect to win
                  love, and never laugh at it."</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Jacobs has also found fault with my Yankee ways, of late," said Mag. "What a
                  pity that I never could learn to live without eating. It would be so
                  convenient."</p>
               <p>"It is an indispensable qualification for a teacher in the Southwest; but one
                  should avoid the foolish mistake of the Dutchman's horse, when he learned to live
                  on shavings. Just as he had got well learned, he died," said Mr. Church.</p>
               <p>"I am afraid the incident may disturb the peace of the family," said Mag. "The
                  judge will never forgive me now, and his hospitable roof will be more unendurable
                  than ever, and I don't think I will ever try to endure it—it will not be worth
                  while."</p>
               <p>And Mag went to Guy and Lizzy for refuge, and Guy laughed at her tribulations, and
                  told her of the fate of those who threw their pearls before swine, and reminded
                  her of his warnings and exhortations.</p>
               <p>But Mag would not stay at Rose Hill. In a few months she left Mississippi and Guy
                  and Lizzy, to find life with new variations, as teacher of the two young sons of
                  Rev. Dr. Lanier, of Marion.</p>
               <p>We will here add, the Kane Co. Institute is still flourishing under the imposing
                  cognomen of the ——— Institute. Its patrons declare that it is undoubtedly the best
                  school in the southern States, and in a very short time they intend to endow it as

               <p>LIFE next dawned upon Mag in the pleasant, thriving little city of Marion, Perry
                  County, Alabama. Her heart thrilled with a real joy, as her eyes fell upon the New
                  England-like village—the civilized-looking white houses with green blinds, the
                  grounds blooming in roses, jasmine and honeysuckle. As they greeted her vision,
                  she knew how well she had loved New England; knew that she was proud of her
                  birthplace; felt that she was a patriot; that to her, patriotism meant pride that
                  she was born a child of fair New England. Her heart swelled, as she thought of its
                  green hills, its sunny valleys, and its glorious granite mountains. A New England
                  girl, alone in the world, but free as a solitary eagle! Some time in the future
                  she would try her wings in other regions—would gaze upon the rarest earth had to
                  show! Alas! it was a fouler world for a<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC6426-00000180"/>
                  woman rover than even she dreamed. Perhaps it would be better for orphan daughters
                  that some kind philanthropist should force them on to heaven in their childhood.
                  Little orphan sister of mine, God knows I have been tempted when you have said
                  your prayers at my feet, and were sleeping in my arms, while the tears were yet
                  wet on your long lashes, God knows I have been tempted to hush the heart-beat in
                  your breast, before it was torn with the unutterable agony that it must know,
                     <emph>it must know,</emph> before the end comes! God help us both, my darling.
                  For there is a God. And he shall save us yet. I will storm heaven itself with
                  prayers for you! And, little beautiful sister, should you go a rover into strange
                  lands—a stranger and orphan—beware especially of church members. The garb that
                  Satan takes to insult widows, orphans, and strangers is the form of religion.
                  Pure-hearted lady romance writers will not tell you this. What do they know of the
                  foul world? Your brother shall save you, my falcon! You shall be safe with your
                  eyes of light in their grave, before you shall be permitted to try the world
                  alone, if God does indeed answer prayer. And there is a God who answers
                  prayer.</p>
               <p>Mag was a stranger, a rover. God had thrown her a waif upon the ocean; she must
                  fit herself for roving. She had work to do, before she allowed herself rest or
                  recreation. Her first work now must be to test God's promises; she must learn for
                  herself, and know whether it was a lie, what the Bible said, that God would answer
                  prayer, nay, that he heard the young ravens when they cry, and clothed the lilies
                  of the field, and watched the fall of the sparrows. Now her book must be written.
                  Whatever else was neglected, that should be neglected no more, and every page
                  should be written with a prayer. Every duty that she owed others should be
                  accomplished faithfully; but when duty was done, then her soul should be her
                  own.</p>
               <p>Life as a teacher, and now working under orders! Obedience to superior officers,
                  to a woman is delightful. When she reverences the moral and intellectual man, her
                  work is all of love. But to submit to obey the orders of inferiors—to do that
                  which the judgment condemns—there was nothing thrilling or heart-satisfying in
                  that to one of Mag's aspirations, or style of cultivation. There might, in the
                  lesson, be the discipline of endurance, but nothing of the expansive nature of
                  happiness.</p>
               <p>In molding and educating the nature to perfection, it is necessary to study noble
                  models. As the painter or sculptor must have his beau ideal, and by earnest study,
                  become familiar with all forms of grace and loveliness, so the soul in humanity
                  must study grand models of human virtue and nobility. Christ is the ideal. Christ
                  is the God of our earthly worship; but we need daily and familiar intercourse with
                  human goodness, truth, and magnanimity. And, alas! how few have any conception of
                  it! Alas! how the weakness and imperfection of human nature in its noblest forms,
                  at times disgust and sicken us; how often we turn from it, disappointed and weary,
                  and swallow our contempt for ourselves and kind, and wonder if man was ever so
                  thoroughly weary before of paltry humanity! But Mag was young, and still on the
                  outlook for something noble in man to reverence; she still had the hope that there
                  would be something divine in man for her to worship. She was waiting to find her
                  master, and be obedient. She had been obedient to Frank Ross, because she
                  reverenced him. She had reverenced Charles Atherton Moore; alas! she had not been
                  obedient to him. Where were his wayward footsteps roving? God bless him, and when
                  next she saw him, she would obey him implicitly. But she did not. She would be
                  glad to obey the next noble soul she met who was her superior. Dr. Arnold of Rugby
                  was one of her ideals; Professor Parks, of Andover, was another; Dr. Olin a third,
                  and President Woolsey, of Yale. She reverenced all these. Edward Everett filled
                  out the very beau ideal. She had a sort of indefinite hope that she should find in
                  the Rev. Dr. Lanier, her new patron, a combination of all these. As Frank said,
                  "there was a deal of nonsense to be taken out of her yet." Mag concluded that he
                  must be one who could teach her to think; one who had absorbed grand truth; some
                  one to whom her intellectual nature might trust itself for guidance; in whose
                  nature her spirit might find repose: in whose finely-trained moral powers, her
                  spirit might have full faith. She knew herself to be a woman—a creature whom God
                  never intended to be alone in the world, of which she could have no knowledge; a
                  being endowed with pure instincts and intuitions, whom God never intended as a
                  reasoner or thinker; she was ready to give her reason and opinions to the guidance
                  of a noble, intellectual man; she knew that women were dreamers—pure and delicate
                  were their<pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC6426-00000181"/> dreams, as every book
                  written by the order will show, and of wonderful intuitions, as Josephine of
                  France, her model of womanliness, had proved. But little opportunity had she on
                  the frontiers for imitating her model; nevertheless, she reverenced obedience,
                  grace, goodness, long-suffering, magnanimity, forgiveness.</p>
               <p>Mag knew herself to be a woman—a dreamer—not a thinker; she did not trust her own
                  thought—knew it could not bear the test of masculine, intellectual criticism. And
                  she really hoped to find a strong, reasoning intellect, who could teach her truth.
                  She had found it once in Charles Moore. She did not doubt she should find it
                  again.</p>
               <p>Whole souls are as rare as diamonds. It is a glorious thing for the young, that
                  their thought may be educated and expanded under the fostering care of
                  large-hearted men—men whose truth and goodness the young must reverence, whether
                  they will or not. Thus the young are taught faith in humanity, strong as that
                  founded on the Rock of Ages. The tempests may come, the winds may blow, storms of
                  temptation may sweep over that faith, the iron may enter the soul, till pages of
                  life history are unfolded, whose every letter is written in blood from breaking
                  hearts, but the foundations of that faith in God and man will never be shaken.
                  Children of noble parents, who love God, are thrice blessed; the blessings descend
                  to their children of the third and fourth generations. But from the influence of
                  ignoble parents, the curse descends, and produces a terrible, terrible progeny.
                  Witness those licentious districts in Europe, where the support of foundlings has
                  become a public curse. The influence of such fathers and mothers is fearful. The
                  responsibility of all parents is fearful. The effect of their errors spreads like
                  the throbbing of air, or the tides of ocean, to the remotest bounds of time. For
                  erring parents, Christ's prayer must be the only hope: "Father, forgive them, for
                  they know not what they do."</p>
               <p>A half hour's conversation with the Rev. Dr. Lanier had put to flight all Mag's
                  beautiful dreams. It needed but a half hour to reveal to her that he was neither
                  Dr. Arnold nor Edward Everett. In fact, what was revealed to her, made her
                  intensely sad; as though again thrown upon an unknown ocean in a crippled boat,
                  which must be trusted to a helmsman more ignorant than herself; a man
                  unfortunately innocent of all knowledge or suspicion of his own ignorance and
                  helplessness. She saw at a glance that if she guided her little life-boat safely
                  through the breakers, it would be in spite of the man at the helm; she must
                  influence him, by causing him to think that his was the controlling spirit and
                  mind. She knew herself to be a superficial scholar and thinker; he was vain of his
                  knowledge as the imperfectly educated always are; his opinions varied with every
                  changing wind; and though Mag doubted her own thoughts, she laughed at his; the
                  phases of faith, with him, were more abominable than Newman's "Phases of Faith,"
                  if possible; Mag's thought passed through fire afterward, and she trusted it more,
                  for she discovered that there were masculine as well as feminine fools and
                  dreamers; Mag was superficial, but this man was more superficial still.
                  Unfortunately, she had a great contempt for a weak, passionate man, and it was in
                  a short time difficult to conceal her contempt for this man and his opinions, and
                  she saw trouble ahead. She was afraid that some day she should "walk over him too
                  emphatically." Mag was a skeptic; she doubted man and God, but she doubted her own
                  thought utterly. She doubted the clashing opinions of all the wise and good men of
                  the ages; then how could she regard the shifting opinions of this inconsistent
                  soul, who had the audacity to think that his teachings were oracles to her, and
                  that he was her hierophant. Girl as she was, she had read books of philosophy, of
                  which he had never heard, and clergyman as he was, she was familiar with works on
                  theology, of which he had never dreamed.</p>
               <p>She must keep her place, by humoring his vanity. How she hated the business! how
                  her soul revolted at the task! She must "appreciate" him! How we all delight in
                  "appreciation!" If Rev. Dr. Lanier ever said or did or wrote a fine thing, his
                  very soul was restless till the world knew and approved it; his "own estimate was
                  not measure enough for him," nor "his own praise reward enough." Mag studied his
                  fine points to appreciate them. He was a poet. In his youth, years before, he had
                  published poetry; even now, at times, he was seized with poetic pangs, and wrote
                  beautiful verses. There were fine fancy and abundantly elegant language to adorn
                  the scattered thoughts he wove into rhyme. He read to Mag whole volumes of what he
                  called his youthful follies, professing to be vastly ashamed of ever having been
                  guilty of those perpetrations, calling a poetry a school-boy disease which he had
                  taken, and from which he had safely recovered. Innocent man!<pb n="362-363"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000182"/> Blind to his own vain craving for flattery, like
                  the poor baby who, when he had closed his own eyes, thought his mother could not
                  see him. Mag "appreciated" his poetry, and his sermons; they were full of imagery,
                  like cloud-piles in a summer sky resting on air. He read them all to her—for
                  "criticism," he said. She noticed the exuberant fancy, the luxuriant language; she
                  was far too wise to notice the want of thought; he was pleased with her criticism,
                  and of course, pleased with her, and for a time she sailed over the quicksands
                  safely—the breezes were favorable. He reported his new teacher as a sort of eighth
                  wonder to the world—wonderfully wise in Latin, Greek, mathematics and the poets.
                  He did not mention the philosophy and theology, for, poor man, he was not himself
                  posted. To prove her accomplishments, he reported to the public her wonderful
                  literary performances—as he would have written a newspaper puff, without regard to
                  the wounded sensibilities of his victim. How her pride was tortured with it all!
                  She thought of Charles Moore, for she was a romantic little soul, and thought it
                  would gall her pride like crucifixion, to have him see her name bandied before the
                  public as blue-stocking, instead of a true-hearted woman. "I have taken my shame
                  upon me! I have indeed taken my shame upon me!" was her soul's cry, repeated to
                  herself again and again. "If Charles Moore has any regard for me, how it will
                  wound his proud, sensitive nature, to have my woman's name on the mouth of the
                  vulgar herd." She almost hated the man that advertised his vanity with her
                  name.</p>
               <p>Rev. Dr. Lanier and lady met Mag cordially—received her in their elegant home,
                  made it a home to her, a delightful refuge from the tiresome, hateful routine of
                  frontier school life and duties. Everything that wealth, or refinement or
                  cultivated taste could procure, adorned that home—pictures, music, flowers, books.
                  It seemed that in this one mansion of Dr. Lanier, the serpent had forgotten to
                  enter with his slimy trail. The mistress of the home was young, witty,
                  accomplished, her mind highly cultivated; she was exquisitely beautiful,
                  exquisitely fascinating, and oh, so exquisitely kind! She was kind to all—to her
                  servants, to the élite that thronged her magnificent parlors; kind to the young
                  and gay, to the old, and poor, and infirm. She was kind and bewitching and lovely
                  to Dr. Lanier, so that she had stolen and ruled his heart; he worshipped her—made
                  her his idol—notwithstanding God had forbidden idols. "Thou shalt have no other
                  gods before me." Her nature overflowed with love to all; she craved the love of
                  all—the love of her servants, of the young, of the old, of the great world and the
                  small world; she often said it was her misfortune that she had always found love
                  irresistible! And with all her kindness, she was lavish of her best gifts to the
                  friendless stranger and orphan who entered her doors. With her own fascinating
                  grace she went with Mag to the luxurious chamber appropriated to her use, told her
                  it should be her home whenever she would accept it; and on that night, Mag knelt
                  down and again thanked God that in the midst of judgment he had remembered mercy.
                  Peace hovered over her in her dreams, and on that night, the heart of a weary
                  wanderer ran over with its fullness of content. Again and again she thanked God
                  that he was with her at last, and that she had found a refuge from the foul world;
                  she had come into a sanctuary, a hallowed place at last.</p>
               <p>"Rev. Dr. Lanier says wonderful things of you, Miss Barclay," said Mrs. ——, one
                  day. "He told me last night that you were certainly the most fascinating lady he
                  ever met—were astonishingly wise in the poets, very appreciative of the beautiful,
                  not beautiful yourself, but the dimples around your mouth were absolutely
                  bewitching."</p>
               <p>"Did the puppy dare?" ejaculated Mag. "God help me! I consider him insufferably
                  presuming in taking the liberty! He will certainly never think it again!"</p>
               <p>If Mag had not utterly disliked the man, she would not have been so thoroughly
                  indignant. To her thought she added, "Charles Moore, in a world like this it is
                  impossible to keep myself precious! I have taken my shame upon me! God help me to
                  bear it! Must a woman alone always be exposed to insult like that? Is there no
                  shield, no protection? Must I live alone among influences that suffocate every
                  noble aspiration of my nature? Is there no way to live in a world like this, but
                  by administering to human vanity, and pandering to human weakness? Can I afford to
                  pay the price of popularity with this high priest? Oh, if I could but find some
                  bright little isle of the ocean, far away from all this human vanity and passion,
                  of which I am getting so desperately weary! I am weary and toilworn with the last
                  desperate battle for breath and bread, and long for rest, it seems to me, as
                  mortal never longed for<pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC6426-00000183"/> it before—long
                  for human love, too, as the angels must have longed for love when they lost
                  heaven. But Charles Moore tells me now, I must make myself a worthy bride before I
                  shall be wooed for that marriage in heaven. I cannot grow worthy here, bending
                  what is noble in me to obey a man for whom I have no reverence. I must work out a
                  noble woman's destiny before I adorn myself for him. Will the bridal ornaments be
                  those of a meek and quiet spirit? humility in the place of this heaven-daring
                  pride? I have not as yet found them."</p>
               <p>There was no escape from the life—no hope but in her book. She determined to pour
                  out her whole life and energies upon it; it was the work of desperation; it must
                  be done now or never; she must do it or die, degenerate by contact with earthly,
                  polluting selfishness.</p>
               <p>Her mind had other work to do; there were obstacles to that book-work
                  mountain-high, but the Bible had said that Faith, like a grain of mustard-seed,
                  could remove mountains. She would take God at his word, and pray. She would have
                  faith now.</p>
               <p>She did pray. Morning and night she prayed, as one whose last hope, whose only
                  refuge, hangs on the prayer. And she worked, too. Too busy was she now to
                  cultivate favor with the high priest—too busy even to return calls from the kind
                  ladies of the town; her life was elsewhere. In her classes every duty was
                  faithfully done, but she avoided all the outer world, except to perform her duty.
                  Her life-problem was one that they could in no wise help her solve. She was now
                  testing God—trying the truth of his glorious promises; she was safe if they were
                  true; all was lost if they were false. She was testing God. Man she had tested,
                  and found him always with elements powerful for evil. She would be in solemn,
                  thorough earnest with every line of her book now. She would keep herself
                  thoroughly trained in physical health, that brain and thought might be clear; half
                  the books written were flooded with the passionate humors of ill-health and
                  nervousness in their authors; books were often but an outlet to the melancholy and
                  misanthropy of disappointed hope; she would write with a clear eye, from a clear,
                  brave soul, God helping her! Rest and recreation, health of mind, body and
                  soul—she must and would have them all, God helping her, as he must, if he existed,
                  and the Bible was his word. Nature demanded rest and recreation. She found them
                  all in the house of Dr. Lanier—music, books, conversation, and mental and social
                  health, with Cora its mistress.</p>
               <p>In a few months, too, she was made happy by a visit from Alec Ross. Life began to
                  bear a gleam of hope. He had been to Huntsville on a visit to the Moores, and came
                  by Marion to see Mag; and Mag went wild with joy to see once more a face that was
                  not the face of a stranger. Only those who, for years, have been strangers and
                  alone, can know how blessed is the sight of a noble face we have loved in
                  childhood. Mag had never been a sister to Alec as to Frank Ross. He had never won
                  her soul as Frank had done; but now that the grave had closed over Frank, the tie
                  that bound them was most sacred. Nothing unholy should ever come between them.
                  Alec Ross was a splendid specimen of manliness—a man of strong passions, naturally
                  taciturn, but of fine genius. Nature intended him for a noble destiny.</p>
               <p>Mag did her best to entertain her guest. Dr. Lanier welcomed him to his
                  hospitality for Mag's sake, and for the sake of Colonel Moore, and especially for
                  the sake of his cousin, "Charles Moore—as noble a fellow," he said, "as ever trod
                  God's footstool." Alec Ross left the King House to accept Dr. Lanier's
                  hospitality.</p>
               <p>"Charles Moore!" How the name quivered along Mag's nerves!</p>
               <p>"Are you, too, acquainted with my cousin, Lieutenant Moore?" Alec asked of Mrs.
                  Lanier one day.</p>
               <p>"He was once one of my dearest and most intimate friends," she replied. "I saw him
                  about two years ago, at Valhermosa Springs, near Huntsville. It was at the time
                  his sister was married there. You recollect the circumstances were not quite
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en régle,</foreign> but it turned out a very pretty
                  romance."</p>
               <p>Alec found wonderful grace and favor with Mrs. Lanier. She gave select soirées
                  every night, to introduce him to the élite of Marion, that he might be charmed
                  with southern society.</p>
               <p>Mag entertained him by teasing him concerning Josie Newton. That old flame was not
                  yet quite extinguished. Mrs. Lanier was quite interested in the affair.</p>
               <p>"I am really jealous of this charming Miss Newton," she said one day. "You must
                  tell me what her chief charms are."</p>
               <p>"Ah," replied Mag for Alec, "she had such sweet,<pb n="366-367"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000184"/> pouting lips, such coquettish dimples, such soft,
                  languishing, sapphire eyes, and complexion of lilies, roses, pearls, rubies,
                  carnations, and a purse of silver and gold, and affections like diamonds! Alec
                  loved them all with untold devotion."</p>
               <p>"And, Mr. Ross, do you love Miss Josie now, better than you love me?" Mrs. Lanier
                  asked, with a sweet, arch look.</p>
               <p>"Impossible! You are as beautiful as Josie Newton. I will not say you are more
                  beautiful, for she is faultlessly lovely; but you are in every gift far her
                  superior. Your wit, fascination, and cultivation, aside from your wonderful
                  beauty, would make your charms irresistible. How can I prevent myself from loving
                  you best?"</p>
               <p>Mag listened to the badinage and compliment, and thought that Alec had not learned
                  it in Puritan New England. Mrs. Lanier laughed.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Ross, you have much of the address of your cousin, Charles Moore. He was one
                  of the most elegant and fascinating men I ever met. There was something mysterious
                  about him, though. He sometimes quite turned my head, and again he was as
                  unapproachable and grim as if all his thoughts were beyond the grave. He used to
                  declare to me, he was meditating an elopement with Death, to a marriage that was
                  to come off in the Hereafter. We were grand friends, I assure you! Our friendship
                  was suddenly cut short. He started East, and friendship has been obliterated by
                  the oceans rolling between us."</p>
               <p>"But neither oceans nor seas can divide our friendship," said Alec. "Time itself
                  cannot sever it, without severing heart-strings."</p>
               <p>It was a strange style of badinage, and Mag thought of Charles Moore, and
                  Valhermosa, and his never-to-be-forgotten letter to her from there; and as she
                  thought, a name in that letter flashed across her mind in letters of light—Cora
                  Lanier! Could this bright lady be the lover he had clasped in his arms among the
                  mountains, when the voluptuous breezes stole his senses from him? Her eye ran
                  swiftly over her figure, hair, eyes—they were the same. Link shot into link in the
                  chain of evidence, till all was complete; she no longer doubted. She shuddered
                  too; the trail of the serpent was even in this paradise, that she had almost
                  coveted. Ah, if we could but look into the hearts of those we envy, how would it
                  destroy the demon of envy. Could we but look into the hearts of our worst enemies,
                  we should see that which would destroy the worst fiend of revenge, and change the
                  monster to pity. There is sorrow and sin enough in every human heart! The Man-God,
                  who saw all the secret thoughts of man, was never known to smile!</p>
               <p>And Charles Moore! No wonder he must leave Valhermosa, or sacrifice his honor! Had
                  not the sacrifice been made before he resolved upon its salvation? No wonder there
                  was at times "an air of unapproachable mystery about him, as if his thoughts were
                  beyond the grave." And Alec Ross was in the snare of this siren! Would he too
                  yield to the temptations of the deceiver? Would his moral strength also give way
                  to the triumph of passion?</p>
               <p>Then came the thought of her answer to prayer—her. tempter. She had demanded an
                  apology of him, and listened to it with her revolver in her hand. In her
                  desperation she had resolved it should do stern duty; for she was sick of life.
                  Was ever another mortal so utterly sick of earth? It should be the means of giving
                  her freedom and Frank's companionship. It is a dangerous thing to dare a desperate
                  woman; circumstances can make of the noblest the most perfect fiends. A strange
                  apology her tempter had given her. She remembered it for Alec's sake now.</p>
               <p>"The animal nature in man is powerful, Miss Barclay. Man needs grace to control
                  it, and there are times when even grace is not sufficient. There is many a sin
                  that grace cannot conquer; these sins can only be disposed of by repentance. Never
                  trust a man because he is a church member, Miss Barclay. Religion never yet
                  subdued a man's passions, whether of revenge or love. My prayer to God is that we
                  may meet in heaven."</p>
               <p>"How do you expect to get there?" Mag asked in astonishment.</p>
               <p>"I am sure I don't know," was the reply. Neither did Mag know.</p>
               <p>Was there any but an infernal meaning to those words? That man bore the name in
                  community of a large-hearted, noble, active Christian; he was the intimate friend
                  of devoted Christians. Yet he declared that grace must be conquered by sensuous
                  passions. If grace in Christian men could not subdue passion, would not Charles
                  Moore and Alec Ross permit the physical to trample down the moral, without the aid
                  of this miraculous grace? What did it all mean? She would be silent; she would
                  watch and see what heart-secrets<pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC6426-00000185"/> would
                  be laid open to her gaze. It is a sorrowful thing to have all our young dreams of
                  the divinity in humanity so put to the torture.</p>
               <p>Charles Moore had entreated her, with all his passionate energy, to permit him to
                  save her from contact with the world. Did he, too, believe that even grace was
                  powerless when striving with human passion?</p>
               <p>"For your own sake, for my sake, for God's sake, let me save you!"</p>
               <p>Many things were becoming clear to Mag. Scales were falling from her eyes. Like
                  all young souls, she could not believe the world so vile! Scripture phrases took
                  new meanings. "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked."
                  She began to believe it, and felt unsafe, and wished she could believe a God was
                  taking care of her. Even "in a world like this" she was safe if the Bible was
                  true.</p>
               <p>She went to church with Dr. Lanier on the Sabbath, listened earnestly when the man
                  of God gave forth his text. Charles Moore had engraven those words on her heart;
                  now every line burned there in letters of living fire. "There hath no temptation
                  taken you but such as is common to man, but God is faithful, who will not suffer
                  you to be tempted above what ye are able, but with the temptation will also make a
                  way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it."</p>
               <p>And she believed it! Cora Lanier might have resisted temptation. "It had been her
                  misfortune that she had always found love irresistible." No, it had been her
                  fault. And Mag knew now that she was in a world full of temptations. Every step
                  was beset from the cradle to the grave; they were infesting every human
                  heart—sleeping serpents, ready to awaken at every breath of self-love. "Therefore,
                  thou art inexcusable, oh, man, that judgest another." The serpents were in her own
                  heart, sleeping around her, too, and she was standing among earthquakes, ready at
                  any time to burst forth. And she knew that Cora Lanier, bright and beautiful as
                  she seemed, was coquetting carelessly upon the verge of a volcano's crater, that
                  at any moment might belch fire and destruction into the heart of the paradise she
                  had distained, and into the noble heart of the man she had already dishonored.</p>
               <p>Mag watched Alec and Cora as they walked home from church together. She heard his
                  low-toned compliment as the wind blew aside her dress; she marked the emphasis,
                  and lingered, fearing she should hear more.</p>
               <p>"The breezes are friendly traitors to those beautiful little feet. Come on my left
                  side, ma belle, and I will shield you from their treachery, and you will be the
                  object nearest my heart, as you are already its queen."</p>
               <p>Yes, the spell was on Alec Ross too. She knew it when, as the time of his visit
                  expired, he lingered—not one day, but many days—ostensibly to visit her; though
                  being in school she scarcely saw him. He lingered as the guest of Dr. Lanier.
                  Where was his sense of honor now? To eat of a man's salt, to sit at his
                  hearthstone, to tamper with his honor, to bring disgrace upon his household gods,
                  pollution upon the home-altar! Alec Ross had come to that. Great heavens! She saw
                  it all, for she was clear-eyed now. Strange to say, she began to believe in God
                  now. She had wondered what he was doing with her; she knew he had work for her
                  now, and she must do it. Her powers came into full play—she felt buoyant—her
                  spirits even became playful; she felt so brave to do—God would help her now—she
                  knew it! She must not only keep herself pure, but she must purify others. She must
                  prove by her life that, whether by grace or without grace, it was possible to
                  resist temptations that wring every fibre of the soul; it was possible to overcome
                  evil with good—to do God service. God should help her. There was a God! None but
                  an Infinite God could open such infinite depths to the soul in the flesh. She was
                  so clear-eyed now. She saw their position and she saw her own; both were
                  dangerous. It was dangerous for her, a stranger and friendless, to peril her own
                  fortune—her good name—by being known as the intimate friend of Cora Lanier. She
                  had not been careful to make herself popular with the high priest—her patron. She
                  had avoided him; but in her new knowledge of human frailty, she had learned that
                  he was revengeful. So are all men. He would never forgive her present want of
                  appreciation of his virtues—never forgive her for disappointing him. Nothing could
                  tempt her now to stay near Cora Lanier. She must leave Marion; and if Cora
                  suspected her knowledge, she would injure her in self-defence, and so would her
                  husband. He would do it now as soon as it was politic. She could see, too, that
                  when she left, some plausible story must go to the public against her—he had
                  praised her too extravagantly on her arrival. If he knew Cora Lanier's
                     weakness—<pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC6426-00000186"/> but he did not—he would
                  anathematise both together. Not for worlds would she harm the siren; not for a
                  thousand worlds send the arrow to the heart of that husband who worshipped her.
                  She had come to both a stranger, and they had received her; she was sick and in
                  prison, and one had comforted her. Alec Ross might dishonor himself by betraying
                  their hospitality—she would not. She loved them far too well; there were in her
                  heart sentiments like love and honor, due them.</p>
               <p>But she had work to do now. She must be about it.</p>
               <p>Wonderful to relate, Providence befriended her. She began to believe in special
                  providences, and answers to prayers. The newspapers were teeming with stories of
                  answers to prayer in those revival meetings—she thought of her prayer—she thought
                  of "Bushnell's Nature and the Supernatural"—she thought of the Bible. She received
                  a letter from Colonel Walter of Marengo County, offering her a liberal salary and
                  a home, to teach his little daughters.</p>
               <p>She took the letter immediately to try the pulse of Rev. Dr. Lanier. She knew her
                  course had offended him—she wanted to sound him as to her precise position in his
                  estimation; she wanted to form an opinion as to how much harm she might expect
                  from him.</p>
               <p>She gave him the letter. He read it and looked up.</p>
               <p>"I do not wish to lose your services as teacher, Miss Barclay. I cannot deny it,
                  you are a splendid teacher."</p>
               <p>"But the salary, sir, you perceive, will be more than I am receiving now. My
                  contract with you, however, does not close until the year closes. You recollect,
                  you even mentioned the day of the month on which the contract was to close, to
                  insure the full year. I came a few weeks before the time. I consider myself bound
                  by that contract."</p>
               <p>"Whenever you are dissatisfied, you are at liberty to go, Miss Barclay."</p>
               <p>"Thank you. And if you are dissatisfied with my services, you are at liberty to
                  dismiss me. I believe, however, you promised to increase my salary after the full
                  year had expired."</p>
               <p>"If I was pleased with your services, Miss Barclay. You are a thorough teacher, I
                  know; but I will tell you frankly, you are unpopular with my little sons."</p>
               <p>Mag smiled. She saw through it all. Saw that he had been trying to find evil
                  against her, by questioning the pupils; had listened to and encouraged every
                  harmful tale that the malcontents could invent. Of course, it was as honorable as
                  eaves-dropping, or listening to servant's tales. She knew it was a slight fiction,
                  the story of her unpopularity; or if there was any semblance of truth in it, she
                  could easily remedy it, whenever it was worth while to make the effort. She never
                  yet failed to make herself popular when she chose.</p>
               <p>She stood smiling, and twirling the letter in her hand, while thought went
                  shooting through her brain. At last, looking up, she said:</p>
               <p>"You say you are satisfied with me as a teacher?"</p>
               <p>"You are really a magnificent teacher."</p>
               <p>"Very well, with your permission, I shall stay and fulfill the year's
                  engagement."</p>
               <p>And Dr. Lanier really imagined he was conferring a favor in permitting it, and
                  thought she would be glad to stay even longer.</p>
               <p>"I have always considered it my duty, in all things that I attempt, to do my
                  best," she added. "I shall continue to do so until the close of the year, when I
                  shall leave."</p>
               <p>And Dr. Lanier thought it all finesse, and that she would not leave.</p>
               <p>"I shall be glad to have you stay, Miss Barclay, on account of your superior style
                  of teaching."</p>
               <p>Mag wrote to Colonel Walter, that if he would wait for her five months, she would
                  accept his offer. He replied that he would wait.</p>
               <p>Her next business was with Alec. She wondered if he really would sacrifice
                  principle to passion, so much as to leave her a stranger and friendless, to
                  continue her intimacy with a woman whom he knew to be unclean. If Alec would not
                  warn her of her danger, neither would she tell him of Charles Moore, nor hint to
                  him that he was not the sole object of the siren's affection. Now that her eyes
                  were opened, she knew there were other men in Marion who shared her favors, and
                  others still with whom she was a marked woman. Undoubtedly, Alec thought himself a
                  lone star; and not yet would she undeceive him, if ever. She must test his
                  principles—the truth of his friendship for her; yet she would do her very utmost
                  to save and honor him.</p>
               <p>"You have glorious talents intrusted to your keeping, Alec," she said to him that
                  starry night, as he escorted her home to Dr. Lanier's. "Does your conscience never
                     reproach<pb n="372-373" xml:id="VAC6426-00000187"/> proach you for not doing
                  your best with them? I do not think you are devoting them to honorable service, or
                  doing with them what God intended, when he gave you those glorious gifts of
                  genius."</p>
               <p>"You are a good girl, Mag, and preach wholesome doctrines to a sinner like me. You
                  are perfectly Utopian—a real visionary; and this world will give you rough
                  handling for the very purity of your ideals. After a few devils have imposed upon
                  you, you will come to the stern realities. You are fresh and pure yet in your
                  aspirations; but, poor child! you will be misanthropic and selfish enough in a few
                  years."</p>
               <p>"Alec Ross, do you not believe in nobility of soul?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Mag, I have known you, and of course believe in it. If I had some one
                  constantly to stir me up to enthusiasm, as you do, I might make something of
                  myself that neither you nor I should be ashamed of. But honestly, Mag, the charms
                  of the fair and frail bewitch me overmuch. My charmers, of the style of Josie
                  Newton, never wrought any good in me, for there was none in them."</p>
               <p>"But is it not our duty to free ourselves from baneful influences? tear ourselves
                  from temptations that are baleful? You have glorious talents—God gave them to you.
                  With them you can make yourself anything that you choose—you can be all that you
                  aim at. With your gifts you have no right to aim at anything less than the
                  noblest."</p>
               <p>"I am not vain, Mag, and you are a flatterer now."</p>
               <p>"Do not play <emph>modest,</emph> Alec. God has made you accountable for what he
                  has given you."</p>
               <p>"Well then, Mag, I am a coward, and dread failures."</p>
               <p>"You are sluggish! Dread failures! Life is a tremendous failure, if we do not make
                  exertion. All things under heaven that are true and honorable and of good report
                  are within your grasp, if you but make the proper exertion. You long for them—I
                  know you do; you lie down and gaze at the luscious fruit, sweeter than any in
                  Eden. Be assured it will not fall into your arms, if you do not open them to
                  receive it, like the lady who has stolen your senses, nor come to your lips
                  uninvited, like a false-lipped siren! <emph>You</emph> dread failures! You might
                  win position, influence, <emph>love</emph>—a love which might be honorable, a
                  blessing to you and yours, instead of a curse to you and her, and the blackest
                  hell to hers."</p>
               <p>"You are in earnest, Mag."</p>
               <p>"You should be in earnest, Alec. What are a dozen failures if success is won at
                  last. You are sure to win. If you exert yourself, it will be against all the laws
                  of nature, that you fail. Dread failures! All life has been a failure to me; but I
                  must work on; if I fail forever, my only alternative is to shoot myself, when I
                  find myself tempted beyond refuge. But our grandest lessons are learned from
                  failures. We gain strength by going to earth; we rise renewed. We gain wisdom,
                  learn how to commence another battle that shall end in victory. If
                     <emph>you</emph> attempt to win, you will never fail."</p>
               <p>"Your words ring upon my nerves like a note from a trumpet. While your spell is
                  upon me, Mag, I tremble like Felix and say with Agrippa, 'Almost thou persuadest
                  me to be a Christian.' When you are gone, I shall listen to the voices of other
                  charmers, and they will wile me away."</p>
               <p>"And unless you make yourself deaf to the songs of the sirens, as Ulysses did, you
                  will be wrecked in whirlpools worse than those of Scylla and Charybdis; you will
                  be wrecked, body and soul. If you do your best, Alec, the noblest in this broad
                  America will be proud to give you a love that will not be the unclean thing from
                  whose spell even now you have not the will to tear yourself."</p>
               <p>"You are a sphinx—unfold your riddle."</p>
               <p>"You say I influence you for good. You will pardon me for saying right now, a
                  bold, unwomanly thing. You are my cousin, Alec, more brother than cousin, for you
                  have no sister, and I have no nearer kin. I love you dearly. There is not another
                  human being upon earth, who has the claims upon me that you have. I love you
                  dearly; but to you, as well as myself, the idea of marriage would be as unnatural
                  as if you were my own brother. For Frank's sake, as well as for your own sake, my
                  love for you is a sacred thing. Nothing unholy shall be permitted to come near it.
                  Not for the universe would I mar it. If you will but be true to yourself, to the
                  nobility that God planted in you, I am capable of a devotion in friendship and
                  love for you, of which you never dreamed. Do you not love me, Alec?"</p>
               <p>"I do love you, Mag. I reverence you as the noblest creature God ever made!"</p>
               <p>"You would never permit harm to come near me, if you could shield me?"</p>
               <p>"God knows I would not. I would do more for you than any human soul."</p>
               <pb n="374-375" xml:id="VAC6426-00000188"/>
               <p>"Do not perjure yourself, Alec. I must be more to you than any other soul, until
                  the one comes to you who has a God-given right to be dearer—bone of your bone,
                  flesh of your flesh. Shall I be the dearest one till then? Promise me, Alec."</p>
               <p>Alec paused a moment before he replied. Strange gleams were darting across his
                  face; strange lights in the midnight eyes. Mag watched them eagerly. Was it not
                  his good angel triumphing over the temptress? He looked up to heaven, glorious in
                  its stars.</p>
               <p>"By all the stars in heaven, Mag, I swear it shall be so!"</p>
               <p>Mag gave a long sigh. He had not sworn by the God above the stars. His words did
                  not satisfy her. There was no honest outlook to those passionate eyes.</p>
               <p>"I must be dearer to you than Cora Lanier."</p>
               <p>"Why do you mention her, Mag?" he asked, hastily. "My regard for her is pure."</p>
               <p>"Pure! I have not said otherwise."</p>
               <p>"There is no wrong, in loving a woman purely. All the instincts in my nature teach
                  me to love her, and to love her purely."</p>
               <p>"Your arms have been around her; your lips on her lips."</p>
               <p>"If it is wrong, who gave me these passions? I did not endow myself. My fate
                  impels me to love all that is lovable and bewitching in woman. The passions must
                  be fed; they were given us to gratify. It is no sin to feed passion, since fate
                  has ordered it Mag, there is no such thing as sin. It is all fate. How can we
                  prevent our passions? Pope said truth—Whatever is, is right."</p>
               <p>"And you have really found use for that sacred dictum!" said Mag, in scornful
                  irony. "It is a noble doctrine when thoroughly tried. I congratulate you, cousin,
                  that you have found suitable exercise for it. The fruits it will bear you, will be
                  burning sweet upon your tongue. What matter if you know them to be burning bitter
                  afterward? And that is Cora Lanier's faith also. Perhaps she taught it you, while
                  her head was on your heart, and you were feeding on those sweet lips, where so
                  many others have fed. She professes to have always found love irresistible. She is
                  anxious to win heaven, whose atmosphere is all love, and is to be received as a
                  member of the church on next Sabbath. Did you know it, Alec? You had better stay
                  and join with her. That is her faith Whatever is, is right."</p>
               <p>"I know." And Cora Lanier did join the church on the next Sabbath.</p>
               <p>"You do? You learned it of her instead of Pope. You discussed that doctrine, and
                  the love doctrine, too, in the presence of Dr. Lanier, and declared that it added
                  to the piquancy of your amour, that he failed to understand your language of
                  double entendre."</p>
               <p>"You are Satan's own, Mag."</p>
               <p>"So Uncle Alph used to tell me. But just now you called me one of God's noblest.
                  Your faith seems to be variable, like Cora's love and faith. When her
                  propensities, guided by your talisman, 'Whatever is, is right,' teach her to throw
                  herself, by that love which is irresistible, into the fond caresses of all her
                  ardent-hearted lovers, thus playing coquette with your pure love, and devil with
                  her husband's—I hope you will excuse my language, I learned it from bad
                  associations on the frontiers, for, spite of ourselves, we do get stained by
                  mingling with sinners. Perhaps that is not to the point, for love cannot be sin,
                  since Christ commanded all little children to love one another; and, of course,
                  love must grow with our growth, and strengthen with our strength, till it becomes
                  heavenly. And, of course, if any wrong comes of it, why God is to blame for giving
                  her such passions. Of course, he ought never to have given the power to control
                  passion—it takes the charm away."</p>
               <p>"Go on, Mag."</p>
               <p>"It was absolutely cruel in God, that he not only made us accountable, but forced
                  us to feel that we were accountable; it was right shabby, that gift of a
                  conscience; it would be so much more convenient if that had been left out. It was
                  unjust and cruel to so spoil the luxury of human arrangements. And for pure
                  daring, the best way to show him your independence of his laws, and your sense of
                  his injustice, will be to tell him frankly and outright, that positively you
                     <emph>won't submit</emph> to have the world regulated on such principles! But I
                  must go. Good night."</p>
               <p>"Stay, Mag, one moment. You are dearer to me than any other human being—dearer to
                  me than Cora Lanier. I have given you my solemn promise that it shall be always
                  so; but let this compact of ours be a secret between us.<pb n="376-377"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000189"/> Do not reveal it to any mortal. I shall leave
                  to-morrow. I will write to you very often, my best friend. Show my letters to
                  Cora. I may address them to you both, as my best friends. Believe me, Mag, my love
                  for her is pure. I would not injure her for the world."</p>
               <p>"Very well. Good night, Alec."</p>
               <p>"I shall call and tell you good-bye in the morning."</p>
               <p>And what did Mag think of it all? Much that was not revealed then. She would let
                  events take their course, and act in emergencies as discretion should dictate. She
                  did not trust Alec. A man who could betray a husband's hospitality and honor,
                  might permit passion to come between his friendship for her and his brother's
                  memory, for Frank had been her guardian angel. There is nothing too sacred for
                  passion to trample upon, when once it has battled down principle.</p>
               <p>Letters from Alec to his "Dear Friends," came pouring in, thick and fast, and
                  long, and passionately eloquent. The tempter, as usual, wore the garb of an angel.
                  Mag carried them all to Cora Lanier; told her that she knew that Alec loved her;
                  that the passionate love-passages were intended for her alone, and she alone knew
                  how to answer them.</p>
               <p>Out came the whole of the sad secret. Mag was made confidante in the affair. They
                  had agreed to correspond under cover of Mag's envelopes, not daring to risk
                  discovery otherwise. They had not dared hope that Mag would approve, so the
                  letters were to have a double meaning, which Cora alone could understand; and Cora
                  translated the double entendre to Mag, and gave her an eloquent answer thereto,
                  burning with love, which Mag sent to Alec, with the added message of her own, that
                  if he had the audacity to write more than once again, she should leave Marion the
                  next day thereafter.</p>
               <p>And thus the affair closed, and thus closed all communication between Magdalene
                  Barclay and Alec Ross, except as mere acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Mag found she had Dr. Lanier and Cora both on her hands, for Cora suspected she
                  was playing her false, as was natural. As both, in self-defence, would find it
                  good policy to harm her if they knew her political measures, Mag grew diplomatic,
                  trying her skill in the wire-work. She had much at stake—her only fortune, a good
                  name—she must preserve it unstained for Charles Moore. A breath could injure it.
                  If Dr. Lanier dared breathe her name in connection with the unholy, he surely
                  should pay the forfeit, for Mag was desperate then. But she had learned to believe
                  in God, still at bay with the world; but she felt brave as well as stern, doing
                  her life-battle with the energy of a strong, desperate spirit, that was roused to
                  life by the sense of danger. She would not fail. The energy went careering through
                  her pulses buoyantly, and she smiled as she went on her way. She was always
                  playful and smiling when danger was near; when her heart was nearest broken, she
                  was most sportive. There was a wild joy in saying that evil itself should not
                  triumph. She would put her foot upon it, she would smile at its writhing, she
                  would bound laughing away from it, if she could not crush it.</p>
               <p>She believed in God now, strange to say—well for her that she did—she would have
                  gone to the bottomless without that faith—gone utterly insane. Her faith in the
                  power of the divine over the human in man was entirely gone. She did not blame the
                  high-priest now for his spirit of revenge; she would not blame Dr. Lanier for any
                  anathema he might pronounce on the daughters of Eve at any future time; she did
                  not blame Charles Moore for doubting her truth, and the wild bitterness went out
                  of her heart at the thought of her answer to prayer; it had rankled there, it had
                  festered, it had blackened her soul with mortification; but these mortals, who had
                  yielded to human weakness, were no worse than their kind: if others seemed better
                  and nobler, it was because they had been shielded from temptation—life had been
                  more a sanctuary. Wise men acknowledged it to be a problem yet unsolved, whether
                  principle itself in humanity was not the result of education and
                  circumstances.</p>
               <p>Many things were growing clear to her. She saw that her strength was developing:
                  one great temptation resisted and conquered gave wonderful strength—gave faith in
                  self. She had done stern battle within the year, had overcome evil, and was none
                  the less pure herself. Conscience approved now. God was working with her and for
                  her. She went to God with it all, with all her new knowledge of human weakness,
                  with all her loneliness, her lovelessness; not to one human being could she reveal
                  her sorrow, her great sorrow, to find those she loved so false and unworthy; she
                  went to God and asked him to pity her, for she was alone, and he had said it was
                  not good for man to be alone. She went to<pb n="378-379" xml:id="VAC6426-00000190"
                  /> him lovingly, too, as she had done years and years before in her simple
                  child-faith. On the very night that Alec left her—a perjured traitor—she went to
                  God, smiling as she threw herself on her knees, saying softly: "I have come back
                  to thee, oh, our Father! deathly weary of all this love-longing and world-battle
                  with those who permit themselves to turn demons, but do with me as thou wilt, only
                  do thou give strength. Thy wayward, loving child hath come back to thee at last,
                  our Father—come back from all her wild, terrible wanderings, back into thine arms
                  once more! Oh, fold her tenderly now, and let her rest from her weariness! Do with
                  her as thou wilt, O Father, thou canst not fail thy child now. Thou hast promised
                  that she shall not be tempted above what she is able. Thy child loves thee now,
                  oh, our Father! but she is tempted to the uttermost, and begs thee that the
                  strokes of thy chastening may be light upon her now, since Christ has loved her."
                  She threw herself upon her couch, and closed her eyes, smiling as she murmured the
                  old baby prayer, "Now I lay me down to sleep." Then the wings of a Psalm floated
                  over her—"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want; he leadeth me to lie down in
                  green pastures; he leadeth me beside the still waters." She slept peacefully
                  during that long night, and floated on radiant dreams. Frank came to her, looked
                  down upon her with his glad, bright, fond eyes; she felt his warm kiss upon her
                  brow, she seemed borne away on clouds with him, he was bearing her up, keeping
                  charge of her lest she should dash her foot against a stone. She trusted him. God
                  sent him, to give her repose from weariness, to fill her heart with pity for the
                  erring; his glad voice rang through her whole soul with its music: "You are right
                  now, Mag! Never fear again. I shall be with you always when you are in temptation.
                  It is all right, Mag. It will be all right at last. God is doing it! I am loving
                  you now as ever, and God is loving you. Your mother is near you, your father is
                  watching you, and God is with us all!"</p>
               <p>It might have been only a dream, but it was a true dream. Homer tells us that
                  "dreams are from Zeus," and Christians tell us they are from God. Mag dreamed that
                  dream, and believed that it came from God; it was a blessed belief. If it was a
                  false one, it did not harm her, it brought her great joy, and strength—and neither
                  time nor eternity can ever take from her the happiness that the belief gave her,
                  whether it was true or false. She worked earnestly on that faith—for it was faith
                  that inspired her now—a glorious faith that made her life so peaceful and glad and
                  buoyant, that she almost went on wings; a new light was in her eye, as that new
                  faith lightened her heart.</p>
               <p>Busy she was, for she had a great evil on her hands to control. She must make
                  acquaintances in Marion; prepare for the worst. She had kept herself precious,
                  secluded from the world. She had nothing in common with its false heart. Hers was
                  buried long ago in New England. But now she must let herself be seen and known, so
                  that if her enemies dared say aught of harm against her, the world might judge for
                  itself whether it was indeed true. The tender mercy of her enemies might be very
                  cruel. She should never trust another human being beyond herself.</p>
               <p>Busy she was. She returned her calls; made herself less careless in dress,
                  accepted invitations to visit the homes in Marion, exerted herself to make a
                  favorable impression, and took time to become popular with all.</p>
               <p>Little time did she have for her book. Again she was obliged to put that off; she
                  was obliged to provide against danger, instead of building up a hope, or testing
                  God on the book. She must shield the fortune she was keeping precious to bring
                  Charles Moore, when she met him in the better land, her good name. The book must
                  wait; yet what time she found she worked on it faithfully.</p>
               <p>One day in her work she found herself in great need of a passage from Plato. Her
                  copy she had given Dr. Robertson, of Charleston; she must have another copy. She
                  went to Rev. Dr. Lanier, requesting him to send for it with his next order for
                  books. He, as usual, volunteered any amount of good advice.</p>
               <p>"Miss Barclay, let me advise you as a friend to be more careful of your money. You
                  will find a much better use for it than buying such books as that. Of what use can
                  they be to you? A lady in your position had better read other books, and save the
                  money. Money is the only thing that gives influence and position in this
                  world."</p>
               <p>"Thank you for the advice, I did not ask for. If you do not wish to send the
                  order, I will get the bookseller to do it for me."</p>
               <p>"Certainly I will send for it; but I think you really need advice as to what is
                  for your best good, and I can tell you that money is the most powerful thing in
                  this world."</p>
               <pb n="380-381" xml:id="VAC6426-00000191"/>
               <p>"Are you working for money alone, sir?"</p>
               <p>"When I left college, my best friend, one of the professors, as a piece of parting
                  advice, told me to make money a prime object in life. It would be a friend when
                  all other friends failed; it bought love, it gave power, position, influence—all
                  things in this world. There was truth in what he said. I took his advice, and have
                  ever since been acting upon it. I am working for money. God has blessed me in my
                  work; he will bless me still. In a few years I hope to be able to leave this
                  drudgery, and serve God because he has blessed me. When I have made myself
                  independent, I intend to devote myself entirely to his service. I believe God
                  recognizes my anxiety to labor for him, and will bless me in my labor for money,
                  so that I may sooner be able to serve him, convert sinners, and save the
                  world."</p>
               <p>"God speed you on your work, sir! I am quite sure he will find it impossible to
                  save the world without your invaluable assistance, and on account of that, he will
                  make all his plans for regulating creation dove-tail into your money matters." Mag
                  couldn't keep down the speech. She went on:</p>
               <p>"But, dear Dr. Lanier, you are no longer young; even now, you are wasting the best
                  of your powers. You do not read, and your mind is retrograding instead of
                  progressing. It seems to me that the mind needs feeding as well as the purse. The
                  contents of the purse may escape—of the mind, never."</p>
               <p>"There is some truth in what you say, Miss Barclay. Sometimes I regret that my
                  mind is so absorbed in these account-books, but I can't help it; God will help me
                  to find leisure in a few years to commence study, and save sinners, and make a
                  name for myself."</p>
               <p>"God help you!" said Mag. "It will be a very essential addition to the glory of
                  his kingdom that you make a name for yourself. He will probably put himself very
                  much out of the way to help you do it. I could almost congratulate him on the
                  powerful help he is about to receive."</p>
               <p>"You are a mischievous creature, Miss Barclay."</p>
               <p>She was too mischievous to be politic then.</p>
               <p>"By the by, my very dear sir, what do you suppose the Man-God meant when he taught
                  his disciples 'Take no thought for the morrow, saying what shall we eat? or what
                  shall we drink? or wherewithal shall we be clothed? But seek ye <emph>first</emph>
                  the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto
                  you?' Of course, Christ must have been joking with those disciples."</p>
               <p>In a year Rev. Dr. Lanier resigned for a more lucrative situation. Mag left Marion
                  at the close of the year. She heard afterward that the hierophant reported that
                  she was a skeptic, and insane, and that he had known it from the first. Well,
                  perhaps he had reason for saying so; at least he found that there was method in
                  her madness. She was thankful that his tale was no worse. Having made
                  acquaintances in Marion, and become popular with her Bible class in church, they
                  might judge for themselves both of her faith and her sanity.</p>
               <p>Mag cultivated her musical powers while in Marion. At her "home" she had practised
                  with Cora and the accomplished Professor Brady—had spent some of her happiest
                  moments in practising duets with the siren—her voice was all music. After the
                  departure of Alec Ross, their voices harmonized better than their hearts. Mag was
                  thankful that Mrs. Lanier had no daughter. The education would not spread to the
                  next generation. It would be a sad lesson to teach a daughter, that love to a
                  woman could be irresistible. To a man, love may be all-powerful—may play the wild
                  with passion—and for him there is redemption on earth as well as in heaven; but to
                  a woman, whose heart finds love irresistible, it is at the price of honor past all
                  redemption. A woman's honor! The slightest breath can spot its purity, and when
                  once sullied, the utterly worst is come; neither winds nor waves can bring back
                  again the pearl of great price. Neither time nor——Can eternity redeem the
                  jewel?</p>
               <p>Among the sinful of earth there is no forgiveness. Only a sinless Christ gave
                  compassion and redemption to Mary Magdalene.</p>
               <p>Magdalene Barclay remembered Alec Ross and Cora Lanier with a great and loving
                  sorrow. Alas! we often love fondly brothers, parents, children, whom it is
                  impossible for us to respect, but then love is full of intense pain and
                  anguish—intense in proportion to the strength of the love.</p>

               <head>XXVIII. PLANTATION LIFE.</head>
               <p>"I HAVE engaged in the wild and stormy conflict of life," said Mag to herself, as
                  she was travelling alone to commence the struggle anew by changing the
                  battle-ground. "Not yet can I find repose. My grave is not ready for me yet, nor
                  the bliss beyond it. As yet I have not been conquered, but another victory like
                  the last would ruin me. For years now I have been a rover alone, and here am I at
                  this day alone and friendless still. No new friends in the great world, and the
                  old friends have forgotten me in their own happiness. One thing priceless has come
                  to me, Faith. The wanderer has come back to God at last. If God fails me now! But
                  though he slay me, I must trust in him now."</p>
               <p>The carriage was passing through the grand prairie lands in the heart of Alabama.
                  She saw an old, grey-headed negro at work in a cotton-field, and told the driver
                  to inquire the way to Colonel Walter's plantation. The driver obeyed.</p>
               <p>"I say, boy, is this the road to Colonel Walter's?"</p>
               <p>The old negro touched his hat, in the style of Chesterfield.</p>
               <p>"Yes, mistis; dis road will fotch you dar directly. Dat is de house up yonder in
                  de fork ob de road. Dar is one of Colonel Walter's boys now."</p>
               <p>Mag turned and saw a handsome little brown-haired, rosy-cheeked rascal, mounted
                  astride a pair of saddle-bags on a splendid grey mustang. He smiled in an
                  appreciative way.</p>
               <p>"Are you Colonel Walter's son?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"No, miss, I'm only his boy."</p>
               <p>"Only his boy, eh?" said Mag to herself. "Well I certainly shan't kiss Col.
                  Walter's boys—it don't do to kiss negroes; but if you had been near enough, and I
                  had not stumbled into the good fortune of asking the question beforehand, you are
                  such a handsome little fragment of the colored population, I should certainly have
                  kissed you for 'white folks.' It's a special providence that I missed the blunder,
                  for I should never have survived the shock."</p>
               <p>Colonel Walter had offered the inducement of a home to Mag, to tempt her to Cedar
                  Grove. The sunshine was pouring down floods of radiant light when she entered that
                  home. It was a pleasant mansion—a large, new, handsome structure, containing an
                  innumerable quantity of rooms, balconies, verandas, etc. It was in the centre of a
                  grove. Through the spacious grounds were winding paths, bordered with shrubbery,
                  leading into groves of cedars and oaks, or into arbors covered with jasmin and
                  honeysuckle. On the south of the mansion the sun was smiling into the heart of a
                  miniature Eden of roses. Upon the west, beyond the cedars, the smoke was curling
                  quietly and gracefully above half a dozen negro cabins under the oaks. Colonel
                  Walter, a tall, dignified-looking man, with white clustering locks, and face
                  beaming with benevolence, met her on the piazza and welcomed her; his lady, a
                  beautiful, warm-hearted Southron, went with her to her room, and told her it was
                  her home. The lady had a sweet, ringing voice, and her laugh was very musical. Mag
                  had seen beauty, and heard music before in woman, and alas! had grown distrustful,
                  and this cordial kindness was not permitted to win her heart. She might have
                  trusted it, for to her it never changed.</p>
               <p>And school was pleasant now. Two little ladies, Margaret, a blue-eyed fairy, who
                  entertained herself with all sorts of mischief that was against the rules of
                  propriety, and Sallie, who was older than Margaret, and who endeavored to reform
                  her sister's ways. There was a sister, Puss, in the family, but as she was
                  married, she went to another school than Mag's, several miles away. There was a
                  brother, Mack, also, whose forte was admiring fair faces, and blue eyes, and one
                  sweet name, Alice.</p>
               <p>Sallie was older than Margaret. And grand times they had, riding over the
                  plantation. The Colonel had a passion for fine horses. He and his lady often drove
                  over to the "negro quarters," a mile away from the mansion, to name the new relay
                  of babies that arrived on this sublunary sphere; and then Sallie and Mag sometimes
                  followed on horseback, and Mag played cavalier to her pupil. Sometimes Mack rode
                  break-neck races with Miss Barclay. Sometimes Sallie got up a performance not down
                  on the<pb n="384-385" xml:id="VAC6426-00000193"/> programme, like a plunging of
                  horses and a breaking of saddle-girths. After kneeling gracefully at the horse's
                  feet on such an occasion, Sallie retired from her devotions and remounted, as the
                  colonel had a serious objection to her being a timid rider. Mag received three new
                  pupils, and with them all she had now something to love—it was delicious, too, to
                  find something to love. And Mag taught them all that the world had taught
                  her—music and art, and poetry, and romance, and history, and philosophy and
                  theology—and she loved them as those love, who for years have found nothing else
                  to love. She found rest and recreation now. And she went to work again on her
                  book, with a fresh prayer on every page, and a fresh courage too. She wrote poetry
                  and romance for the newspapers, and felt highly appreciated, when Mary Ann, her
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">femme de chambre,</foreign> a pretty, educated
                  quadroon, declared her compositions to be very charming. She thought her star must
                  be rising. Never before had she known the genial kindness of a home. Her heart
                  glowed and expanded under the kindness. She grew daring, and saucy and piquant in
                  her study of heart-histories; for she had told Charles Moore that one of her
                  principal life-studies should be, to learn the mysteries in human hearts—the ways
                  of men with maidens.</p>
               <p>She was seated one evening in the drawing-room, her portfolio in her lap. Mrs.
                  Walter was on the lounge, talking merrily, the colonel in a big arm-chair,
                  discussing a newspaper document. Mag was not in a mood for writing—she was in an
                  inquisitive mood.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Walter, please tell me how in the world the colonel came to fall in love
                  with you?" she asked with saucy mischief.</p>
               <p>"He says it was all done for pity's sake," Mrs. Walter replied, with a laugh that
                  showed her beautiful teeth to the best advantage. The colonel went on reading the
                  items of a shocking catastrophe.</p>
               <p>"Colonel Walter, please relieve my agony of curiosity. Enlighten me as to the
                  particulars. You have not the slightest idea of my distress to get the items for
                  my book. I am taking notes for publication. If you will relate the affair, I will
                  publish, sure as fate."</p>
               <p>"And I will prosecute you, sure as shooting."</p>
               <p>"Item first," Mag went on, writing. "She was your first wife's brother's widow.
                  Something new in romance."</p>
               <p>"Sick and alone," added the colonel, laughing.</p>
               <p>"Desolate and forlorn," chimed in the lady.</p>
               <p>"I knew she was of no earthly benefit to herself or anybody else, under the
                  canopy, and I married her to take care of her, and to make her a useful member of
                  society. She could at least keep the children from falling in the fire."</p>
               <p>"That was excessively amiable in you, sir," said Mag, taking notes. "That will
                  look uncommonly well and original in my book."</p>
               <p>"I believe you have some iniquity in your head. What sort of a book do you intend
                  to get off?"</p>
               <p>"Exceedingly pious and excessively funny. The pious part is to captivate the money
                  of the good—the funny part to beguile reprobates, before they know it, into
                  goodness. I shall put your history in it on account of its moral—a warning, you
                  know. I think I can consider you on the good list, however. I can tell better when
                  I have seen more of your behavior."</p>
               <p>"Put my case down as a warning. My hand, heart and fortune were insnared by charms
                  like those," he said, pointing to his lady. "Many another innocent soul has been
                  so ruined. She laid the trap for me, and I walked into it."</p>
               <p>"The particulars, if you please, sir, or I shall fail to bring out the moral."</p>
               <p>"She and our brother-in-law took my Mack one side—he was a little fellow then,
                  although he is big enough for you now—and drilled him on some questions to be put
                  to me."</p>
               <p>"Your book is a work of fiction?" asked the lady, pointedly.</p>
               <p>"Mack learned his questions prime. He has a forte for asking ladies questions now;
                  I consider it the result of that early drill. You must look out for him, Miss Mag.
                  He will be asking you questions."</p>
               <p>"I will ask him first, and save him the trouble. What was the one he asked
                  you?"</p>
               <p>"One day, Jinsie and I were sitting together, large as life, eating peaches, when
                  Mack walked up to us mighty sweet, and says: 'Papa, mayn't Aunt Jinsie go home and
                  live with us to keep house?' Wasn't it a poser? For a minute I didn't unbutton my
                  lips. I flashed my eyes up at her, and great Jerusalem, how she was blushing! She
                  knew she had put him up to it. I told Mack 'Aunt Jinsie must go home with us, and
                  he must ask her when she would be ready to start.' The little Cupid did it."</p>
               <pb n="386-387" xml:id="VAC6426-00000194"/>
               <p>"And I told him," added the lady, "that I would go home when his papa, my brother
                  Charles, was married; but Mack insisted that he wanted me to go, so that his papa
                  need never be married."</p>
               <p>"Now for the finale," said Mag, writing. "That looks well so far."</p>
               <p>"Some one proposed soon that all the household should take an airing. And to be
                  sure there came such a calling for horses, carriages, buggies, drivers, you would
                  have thought all Christendom was to take a drive. I, for one, became alarmed for
                  fear all might not be accommodated. I offered several grown people and any amount
                  of children, seats in my buggy."</p>
               <p>"Did all the inhabitants ride out? I must be particular for the book, you know, to
                  get the exact number. Critics are very particular on these things."</p>
               <p>"Well, yes. This one was suddenly seized with the headache, that one with the
                  tooth-ache, yonder one had the earache, and t'other one the toe-ache. All the
                  horses and carriages and drivers were sent back to the stables, and she and I rode
                  alone in my buggy."</p>
               <p>"And the result?" said Mag, writing with the gravity of a sphinx.</p>
               <p>"In two months I was married."</p>
               <p>"She was married, I suppose, some time after."</p>
               <p>"She came here after that to satisfy Mack, and to keep the other children out of
                  the fire."</p>
               <p>"Mack's papa was not obliged to be married after that."</p>
               <p>"The colonel was excessively bewitched in those days, was he not, Mrs. Walter?"
                  asked Mag.</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes; he used to tell me over, and often, and besides, and again, that I was
                  the prettiest creature on the top of God's green earth, and parting with me for a
                  week was worse than parting with his eye-teeth, which used to affect me so that I
                  cried like a baby at mention of it."</p>
               <p>"Oh hush, Jinsie! You'll ruin your book, Miss Mag, and I shall sue you for libel."
                  The colonel picked up the newspaper, and read aloud, with intense gravity, the
                  details of a horrible catastrophe, at which Mag and the lady laughed with
                  heartlessness perfectly horrifying.</p>
               <p>The exercises were interrupted by the entrance of Jupiter, the factotum of one of
                  the nearest neighbors, a splendid mulatto, into whose individuality was gathered
                  the very quintessence of all the politeness of seventeen Frenchmen. Jupiter, with
                  a series of bows, advanced and presented an enormous bouquet of roses to Mrs.
                  Walter.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Jupiter!" exclaimed the lady; "isn't it magnificent?"</p>
               <p>"By Jupiter!" exclaimed the colonel.</p>
               <p>And while they were diving their faces and fingers into the midst of hundreds of
                  crimson and cream-colored roses, the bouquet being fringed with fairy white buds,
                  Mag picked up her notes for publication, and slipped out. She met Mack Walter on
                  the piazza, with a bouquet of verbenas and hyacinths.</p>
               <p>"The belle of the Cane-Brake sent you these with her compliments, Miss
                  Barclay."</p>
               <p>"Thank you. Did you 'propose' to her by means of these flowers?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I 'propose' to her every week regularly. She gave me these to help me out
                  while proposing to you."</p>
               <p>"How many belles are you engaged to now, Mack?"</p>
               <p>"I am in love with three, besides yourself."</p>
               <p>"You must tell me all about them sometime; I shall take your portrait for
                  publication. A southern gentleman flirt. You are really a fine specimen of the
                  order, and can help me out in my researches of human hearts. You must keep
                  yourself in practice, and when you propose to me do it in your best style, for I
                  shall put it in my book, and it may win you immortality."</p>
               <p>"Will you have it in poetry?"</p>
               <p>"Pooh; no indeed. I shall want to watch your eye—and you had better study on the
                  gestures and emphasis. Recollect it is to go down to all future generations."</p>
               <p>"Well, I must watch your dimples too. Miss Mag, you must try to blush, or I can't
                  get on with it."</p>
               <p>"If it were only possible, now! I'll do my best, Mack; for the benefit of
                  posterity, you know! We are to labor for public good."</p>
               <p>And Mag ran with her portfolio and bouquet to her room. The kindness of the
                  beautiful girl, the nearest neighbor, who sent it, thrilled down into Mag's heart.
                  And the sweet beauty of the flowers with that fragrant kindness, strange to say,
                  brought a gush of sadness over her, with the seraphic visions that had haunted her
                  young dreams on the lakes and mountains of New England. Memories rose sweeter than
                  the blossoms, fragrant with her one life-love. A great gush of longing swept over
                  her; soft, beaming, liquid eyes looked<pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC6426-00000195"/>
                  down into her soul with their reproachful tenderness. Would that reproach haunt
                  her forever and forever? She went out into the groves of cedar, and let her heart
                  sun itself in the memory of their melting light. For a time the agony of longing
                  would have sway. She bowed herself in reverence to the image set up in her heart,
                  of Charles Atherton Moore, and the pure God's truth in his remembered gaze. It had
                  taught her more of the glory of Eden than the inhabitants of Eden ever saw. His
                  voice had been her music, sweet as heaven. Heaven could never be heaven to her
                  unless she heard it there; heaven could not be heaven to her unless she could know
                  those fond lips all her own, and the heart throb true to her forever—to know that
                  she would never again be alone and unprotected in a world full of fiends—where
                  some men were endowed with "arithmetics instead of consciences, and vultures in
                  the place of hearts;" though others had developed into angels. That voice! Would
                  she hear its love-music no more till eternity? No more?—no more? Yet till eternity
                  dawned, its echo would be angel sweet. He had prophesied right. None but those who
                  had lost a heaven of love, could know the agony of longing that sobbed silently in
                  the soul's great depths, while the eye was tearless and the lip smiling. God have
                  mercy on the weary. There are moments of passionate anguish that sweep over the
                  soul, we know not why they come, but the foundations of the great deep are broken
                  up, and faith itself is torn away by the raging storm. What in the name of the
                  merciful is God doing with us? Down to dust and ashes we go, with the wreck of the
                  beautiful—our life-hopes and strength all vanished—love trailing in sack-cloth,
                  till we are awe-struck at our ghastly hopelessness.</p>
               <p>Thank God that nature reacts. In degradation and dust our youth is renewed. We
                  mount up on wings as eagles; we run, and are not weary; we walk, and are not
                  faint.</p>
               <p>Mag took her heart to her chamber, and it continued its reverie. She was giving
                  freedom to its passionate longings—permitting a dangerous experiment—the tendency
                  of such license is to madness.</p>
               <p>Mat, Bettie and Jennie, her pupils, knocked softly at her door and entered.</p>
               <p>"We have come to dress your hair to-day. We want to arrange it so sweetly, that
                  the one you love best, would feel that you were beautiful."</p>
               <p>Their soft fingers on her temples charmed away the sad, passionate longing. She
                  blessed them again for their kindness.</p>
               <p>Again she wandered out into the sunshine.</p>
               <p>She strolled into one of the negro cabins, and there lay a soul warring with
                  death. "God help us! Vanity of vanities, all is vanity!"</p>
               <p>The spirit was struggling madly to free itself from the flesh. Paul, a young,
                  strong, gigantic specimen of the creature made in the image of God, was dying. Why
                  must the spirit leave that firm flesh? What charm was there to that black clay,
                  which the spirit had fled? What charm now to the once glorious flesh of Frank
                  Ross? Would her lips cling to his moldering lips fondly now? Not long before, in
                  dreams, his arms had enfolded her. Was not the kiss of the spirit better than the
                  touch of the flesh. Frank was living still, and now brought her faith, when
                  midnight was settling upon her soul.</p>
               <p>She had looked on death many a time; had watched that mysterious parting of soul
                  and body, trying to discover whether we do indeed "die as the flowers;" trying to
                  get glimpses of the unknown regions, whither the spirit fled, if death was not a
                  dreamless sleep.</p>
               <p>There was, to her, a strange fascination in the lifeless clay. She had spent whole
                  nights with the beautiful dead. Mysterious charm, could she but send messages by
                  the departing to the departed! On the supposition that there was a hereafter, a
                  God of the present, a divine Christ, and a Paraclete, she had kept her every
                  thought, word, and action pure, under temptations that wrung the last fibre of
                  nature. She had adopted the theory found in the Bible: "Be not overcome of evil,
                  but overcome evil with good." Men and devils had laughed at it, "in a world like
                  this," as utterly impracticable. But neither for men nor devils would she dishonor
                  her own nobility.</p>
               <p>Mack Walter came and stood by her. He shuddered with her to witness the seeming
                  agony of that flesh. Was the spirit unconscious in all that terrible writhing and
                  gasping? The flesh was so strong, and the soul tearing out of its prison with such
                  superhuman strength. Where? Where was it flying?</p>
               <p>"Where is Paul going, Mack?" she asked. Mack was silent. His handsome features
                  were shrouded with gloomy thought.</p>
               <p>"He is a sad reprobate, Miss Barclay."</p>
               <pb n="390-391" xml:id="VAC6426-00000196"/>
               <p>"There hath no temptation taken him, but such as is common to man."</p>
               <p>And Mag left the living soul with the dying soul—nay, can the soul die? Mag
                  thought of Plato on immortality, and of Christ. She entered Molly's cabin. Poor,
                  frail, Molly. She, too, like Cora Lanier, had found love irresistible. How
                  gloriously the sunshine was pouring down smiles through the green, waving trees
                  before the cabin door, mocking the agony of the dying wretch yonder. The very
                  leaves were rustling with low laughter, as the winds went dallying and coquetting
                  with them. Mag was sick with passionate thought; she threw herself on Molly's
                  couch. Molly brought a pillow for the burning head—she, too, like Cora, had a
                  heart overflowing with kindness to high and low. She bathed Mag's temples with her
                  choicest treasured cologne.</p>
               <p>"Did you ever wish to die, Molly?" Mag asked, as a zephyr came wandering by, and
                  kissed her fevered lips. There was a world of mournfulness in the large dark eyes.
                  Molly's face reflected intense pity. The negro race are full of impulsive,
                  uncontrolled emotion.</p>
               <p>"No, Miss Magdalene. Oh, no, I ain't good enough to die yet!"</p>
               <p>Aunt Mary Jane, a splendid mulatto, sat sewing in Molly's cabin. She had the
                  reputation of being the most unmanageable fury on the plantation—too much white
                  blood in her veins. There was a strange, soft gleam in those bright, glowing eyes,
                  that amazed Mag, who was trying to fathom the secrets of all human hearts. There
                  was a subdued, loving beauty in those eyes, that would have adorned the face of an
                  angel.</p>
               <p>"Did you ever long to die, aunty?"</p>
               <p>"Well, Miss Magdalene, sometimes when I lie awake, night after night, in pain and
                  trouble, I thinks ef it's the Lord's will to take me, I'd be almost willin' to go.
                  Why? did you ever want to die?"</p>
               <p>Mag had longed to die a thousand times.</p>
               <p>"I am sure I don't know, aunty. I think now, that I wish I was in Paul's place,
                  yonder, dying. He, poor fellow, begged the doctor to save him. But the doctor
                  could not do it."</p>
               <p>"Paul was dreadful wicked, Miss Magdalene," said Molly.</p>
               <p>"And you and I are dreadful wicked, Molly. Do you never do wrong, knowing it is
                  wrong?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes." Molly hung her head. "Everybody does wrong, knowing it's wrong.
                  Everybody knows I do wrong; but I know I'm better than some, that pretends to be
                  honester than I, Miss Magdalene; one is just as bad as another, only some hides
                  their badness."</p>
               <p>Molly was fully convinced of it too. And Mag would not judge Molly. She thought of
                  Christ's words: "Whoso is without sin, let him cast the first stone at her." She
                  remembered how pitilessly Cora Lanier pronounced judgment against sinners. She
                  remembered that pure-hearted May Burton judged a woman—oh, so gently, as a woman
                  ought to judge a woman! and began to think that only the sinful never forgive sin
                  in others. "To the pure, all things are pure."</p>
               <p>Mag had hugged the blessed delusion to her soul that she had never, never, never
                  violated conscience. Had she not consoled herself with the Pharisee's prayer? She
                  had seen spiritual wickedness in high places; "had been irreverent to the false,
                  from very longing to worship the true; had turned in disgust from one pretended
                  teacher after another, for all were blind leaders of the blind." There was none
                  good—no, not one.</p>
               <p>"Then, you really love this beautiful world, Molly?" she said at last, looking up
                  out of the pain in her heart. "What do you, sinful girl, find to comfort you
                  here?"</p>
               <p>"My children are a world of comfort to me!"</p>
               <p>They were all children of shame.</p>
               <p>"And God permits even that mother's love to be hallowed. How was it in those
                  European districts, where the multitude of foundlings had become a public
                  nuisance? How was it in the shame of England, where marriage could not be afforded
                  by those who herded together in starvation and want?" Mag asked.</p>
               <p>"God permitted this mother's love to be hallowed. God, the All-Father. God, who is
                  love—whose heaven is love. These are strange mysteries; and why—why—why, are these
                  things so? <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"And oh! if, perchance, there should be a sphere,</l>
                        <l>Where all is made right, which so puzzles us here,</l>
                        <l>Where the soul, disenchanted of flesh and of sense,</l>
                        <l>Unscreened by its trappings, and shows, and pretence,</l>
                        <l>Is clothed for the life and the service above,</l>
                        <l>With purity, truth, faith, meekness and love."</l>
                     </lg>

               <p>"I have extracted rare secrets from the 'Mother of Sorrows;' learned God-sent
                  lessons from woe and degradation. Perhaps the Man-God has a mission for me to
                  accomplish yet, to the sinful and down-pressed; perhaps I have some great,
                  unconscious sin sleeping upon my conscience that needs atonement; perhaps I have
                  wronged my best lover, by thought, or word, or deed. If so, in humiliation and
                  sorrow, I shall redeem myself yet, and be a redeemer to others, so help me
                  God!"</p>
               <p>And then Mag promised the "Our Father," that if he would give her but one day with
                  Charles Moore, to tell him all her heart, she would die satisfied. Now her life
                  should be devoted to redeem others.</p>
               <p>Poor Mag; within an hour she saw degradation past sorrow, and could only sicken
                  over it, without having any hope in prayer.</p>
               <p>Just beyond the inclosure at Cedar Grove is the square mile of public land, known
                  in Alabama as the Sixteenth Section; every sixteenth square mile in the State
                  being devoted to the public school fund.</p>
               <p>This land is rented to the class of people known as "poor white folks."</p>
               <p>There are about fourteen cabins on the mile, inhabited mostly by people who have
                  once owned servants, but by thriftlessness have lost all. For the most part, a
                  more miserable-looking set of unfortunates surely never breathed. Mag went out to
                  talk with nature, and listened to what was surely unnatural, though the
                  conversation really occurred, and that is why it is given here.</p>
               <p>She passed the nearest cabin. Five or six filthy, tattered little girls were
                  hanging on the fence, keeping the dogs from her, as she entered the gate. She
                  heard a shrill voice scream from the cabin:</p>
               <p>"y-e-a-o-u-. H-e-n-r-y- C-l-a-y!"</p>
               <p>The answer came ringing back from a ragged boy of thirteen:</p>
               <p>"What in the h—— do you want now?"</p>
               <p>"Come here, you sassy d——, or I'll make your daddy give you a hundred lashes,"
                  said the mother.</p>
               <p>"By G——! No you won't, you old fool you!" Henry Clay responded, walking off. Mag
                  entered. The woman was sick, lying on a filthy straw mattress, a young baby in her
                  arms. The six little girls followed Mag in, and stood around staring at her, as
                  she greeted the woman, whose face looked like that of a skeleton covered with
                  sallow skin. She ordered "them impudent gals" to "clear out o' the house," but
                  they disobeyed orders.</p>
               <p>"Them children do make so much fuss and clatter, Miss Barclay, anybody might a
                  knowed I'd gone crazy long ago, if I hadn't been naterally a mighty strong-minded
                  woman."</p>
               <p>Mag picked up the forlorn baby and tried to admire its innocence. She inquired its
                  name.</p>
               <p>"His name is Charlie."</p>
               <p>Mag resisted a strong inclination to throw the thing out the window.</p>
               <p>"I allers did hate babies, and sometimes I think it's a judgment sent on me, that
                  I've got sich a lot of 'em. Six gals and two boys. One of the boys we named Henry
                  Clay, hopin' it would make him a smart man. T'other one is Charles Walter, from
                  Colonel Walter. I tell him I want the colonel to adopt the baby if I die, and see
                  which of the two names will make the smartest man."</p>
               <p>"You are looking dreadfully sick," said Mag, changing the subject.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I've got a dre'ful risin' in my side, and if it breaks inside, I'm certain
                  to die. I knew a woman that died of such a swellin'; when it broke in her, it
                  popped like a pistol."</p>
               <p>Mag was speechless; she tried to amuse the baby, that looked shockingly like its
                  mother, who continued in monologue:</p>
               <p>"I tell the old man, that if I do die, and he gits my gals a stepmother, and
                  marries again, I'll haunt her and him. All he said to it—the old sinner—was to
                  ask, what the d—I was a-lyin' up here for, tellin' sich lies—I'd been a-dyin', and
                  a-dyin', ever since he had known me, and hadn't died yet. I telled him, I
                  shouldn't do it now, if I could help it! I'm like old Tantabogus, Miss Barclay, I
                  want to live till the last day in the afternoon."</p>
               <p>And Mag thought she had wished to die, in Paul's place, who by this time had
                  probably gone. She put the baby, "Charlie," back into its fond mother's arms for
                  protection and love.</p>
               <p>In a few days that Charlie died, and the mother recovered. Dr. Kane says that the
                  soul can lift the body out of its boots. Perhaps the mother's determined will made
                  her "swellin' pop open" on the outside. Perhaps it<pb n="394-395"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000198"/> was a case of special providence. Poor baby! How it
                  could help dying was the question. It was fed on coffee without milk, and was
                  never but once dressed and washed in its short life of four weeks.</p>
               <p>Mag concluded she would not be "sentimental" any longer that day. She would be
                  thankful. She would have a calm pulse. There was slavery worse than negro-slavery,
                  wretches on earth worse than orphaned, and a thousand deaths worse than the simple
                  parting of soul and body. The flesh could be not only the grave of the spirit,
                  there was flesh destined to become the spirit's hell. Mag knelt down in her
                  pleasant chamber and thanked God for his wonderful mercy to her.</p>
               <p>The next event that interested her attention deeply was a wedding. It interested
                  the whole family, for there was to be a fandango for the occasion. Mary Ann, her
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">femme de chambre,</foreign> disposed of herself in
                  marriage to Washington, the coachman, who was a new arrival from Tennessee. He was
                  very popular among the colored population—had a wife in Tennessee, a free woman,
                  but she wouldn't be persuaded to join her husband in Alabama, and Mary Ann
                  consoled him. Wash was a real "quality" negro, used handsome language, was polite
                  as a prince, had known the "big-bugs"—Gen. Gideon Pillow for one, carried him his
                  wedding-suit when he was married, had an opinion of the man, too, and expressed
                  it, "that Gen. Pillow was the most unpopular man in Tennessee; he might
                  electioneer till doomsday for office, and he would never get his own kin to vote
                  for him."</p>
               <p>Washington and Mary Ann concluded to be married. She was prettier and smarter than
                  his free wife anyway; she was "quality," too—could read, had been free herself in
                  Charleston once, was handsome, had high notions there—two white children for
                  instance—but that did not make any difference, she had repented; she was proud
                  that Alec was sometimes mistaken for a white boy. They had a grand wedding. Puss,
                  the oldest sister, made bride's cakes. Sallie made syllabubs, and Margaret made
                  pyramids of bouquets, and Mack made fun. Mack went to town to get the minister to
                  perform the ceremony, Mag lent the bride, and every other bride that wanted them,
                  her watch and chain. Mack protested against such a corruption of morals, declaring
                  that it was permitting the jewelry to commit polygamy. It was a "quality
                  fandango"—three bridesmaids, two quadroons, and one blue-eyed white mulatto, so
                  fair, no one would have mistrusted the "color" in her veins—all dressed in new
                  embroidered Swiss muslins and white bridal wreaths.</p>
               <p>The minister performed the ceremony; Mack insisted that the most essential part of
                  the ceremony was that the minister should kiss the bride—minister wouldn't be
                  persuaded to do it. Mag told Mack to set him the example, and Mack demurred; Col.
                  Walter also refused to do it, even at Mag's particular request.</p>
               <p>And after this they all went to a camp-meeting, thus:</p>
               <p>One gorgeous, golden and glorious morning early in October, Sallie, Margaret and
                  Mag, with Mary Ann and Molly, the servants, exalted themselves to the utmost
                  height of their capacity for human bliss, viz., the acme or tip-top of a six-power
                  mule wagon, loaded with mattresses, trunks, chicken-coops, bedsteads, turkey-pens,
                  chickens, ducks, turkeys, and so forth, et cetera, and so on. They found their way
                  to said summit of bliss, by first filling their reticules with cold ham, chickens
                  and biscuits, and their pockets with nuts, apples and ginger-cakes—for the
                  spiritual state lying dormant then, to their unspiritualized tastes, happiness
                  wasn't happiness without a pocketful of "goodies." To reach this height of bliss,
                  they placed the tips of their laced boots first on the hub of the fore wheel, next
                  on the uppermost verge of said wheel's circumference, thence lifting the weight of
                  their precious bodies—Mag's weighing just one hundred and twenty-five pounds—up
                  toward the clouds, into the cerulean, where, in serene content they looked upon
                  the busy world far down beneath them, undisturbed by its petty cares, passions and
                  vanities. Thus enthroned in the sublimity of their own aspirations, they moved
                  majestically along, with Gabriel mounted on one of the hindmost mules as driver to
                  further bliss, Mack going ahead on horseback, the colonel and Mrs. Walter in a
                  buggy.</p>
               <p>Through the limestone prairies Gabriel guided his steeds; the fields were white
                  and emerald with drifting cotton, golden and brown with corn ripe for the
                  harvesting. They passed through the gigantic forests, where the majestic old
                  trees, in the embraces of loving, young, beautiful vines, like David with Abishag,
                  were renewing their withered veins with youth; but the vines, strange to say,
                  clung delightedly around them, trusting in their rugged and glorious strength.</p>
               <pb n="396-397" xml:id="VAC6426-00000199"/>
               <p>They soon met, in their triumphal progress, a large party of servants—men, women,
                  children and babies, followed by an emigrant wagon, on which they looked down from
                  their seats in the upper spheres; they recognized it instantly as a speculator's
                  team with his wares. The wares of a southern speculator or trader are all
                  specimens of flesh and blood that he is able to bring into market for sale. This
                  lot of goods consisted of handsome boys and girls, with bright eyes and brighter
                  teeth, laughing ebony cherubs in their mothers' arms, and some elderly servants,
                  who looked weary of their voyage. All gave a cordial greeting.</p>
               <p>"Good morning, uncle! Good morning, aunty!" called Mary Ann, and Molly, and Mag,
                  and Sallie, and Margaret, in a breath.</p>
               <p>"Good mornin', honey! Good mornin', chillen! How d'ye? How you do?" came
                  replies.</p>
               <p>"Where you come from, aunty?" called Molly.</p>
               <p>"From ole Virginny."</p>
               <p>"Did you, sure enough? I came from ole Virginny, too. Maybe now, you know some of
                  my folks?"</p>
               <p>"When did you come from Virginia?" asked Mag of Molly.</p>
               <p>"Oh, when I was a little gal. I came wid speculator."</p>
               <p>"Did you not feel terribly at leaving home?"</p>
               <p>"No," said Molly; "I was young, you know, and thought 'twas mi'ty nice to go
                  abroad." She called to another: "Whar you come from, uncle?"</p>
               <p>"From Souf Car'liny, honey."</p>
               <p>"So did I," said Mary Ann. "I used to be free in Charleston." Mary Ann was mighty
                  proud of it, too.</p>
               <p>The establishment soon arrived at the bustling little city of Uniontown, drove
                  majestically up to the store of Mr. Henry, one of its merchant princes, stopped,
                  and purchased a tin cup!</p>
               <p>They reached their destination in due time. The encampment consisted of rows of
                  log and frame cabins, meeting at right angles, inclosing a large square, in the
                  centre of which was an immense roof, capable of sheltering several thousand
                  persons.</p>
               <p>"Colonel Walter and lady received them at their cabin door. Then followed such a
                  time of putting up furniture, and down matting as is indescribable. The confusion
                  was delightful; they revelled in it; ran riot in its luxuriance, and when its joys
                  were all exhausted, they strolled off into the woods for chinkapins (fruit
                  resembling chestnuts). Mack bought out the first apple-merchant he met, and bribed
                  his way into the pantry among the pickles and preserves, to stay his feelings
                  against the good time coming; and when night came, Mag said her prayers
                  gratefully, and slept soundly, nor longed once for home or a mother's love, but
                  she did dream blissfully of Charles Atherton Moore.</p>
               <p>A week rolled away, and the delightful confusion still reigned. There were the
                  good things, like pigs and turkeys, to interest them—also lots of sermons from the
                  "big-guns" of the Alabama Conference.</p>
               <p>The moral and social tastes got incomprehensibly mixed at night. Then the whole
                  camp-ground was illuminated with light-wood torches, and the very spirit in men
                  and women was stirred by the wild music of the camp-meeting songs, and Mag tried
                  to throw her soul into the spirit of it. She wanted to know for herself all the
                  "experiences" that life could give. Dr. Neely aroused their souls by his clarion
                  eloquence—the altars were thronged with "mourners" inspired by that ringing call.
                  He stood up before the great congregation and entreated all that were weary and
                  heavy laden to come up and find rest for their souls. So the Man-God in the
                  wilderness might have invited sinners. The invitation was given now in tones
                  wonderfully winning, and Mag thought of the Christ and his call; "I am the way,
                  the truth and the life—no man cometh to the Father but by me."... When Mag heard
                  the inspiring call, she would have gone up, if she had not seen spiritual
                  wickedness in high places—if she had not heard her tempter in Hartford give the
                  same thrilling invitation to sinners.... Mag doubted that religion of
                     <emph>feeling.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>But other mourners listened to the solemn, eloquent call, and they believed; they
                  came up to the altar, threw themselves in abandon into the dust—their hearts
                  burdened with all strange sorrows of earth. Mag did not wonder that they longed to
                  lay them down—she longed to lay hers down at times; and down in the altars the
                  priests and people, mourners and comforters, were prostrated together, and the
                  wild cry of desolation rung forth, and then the prayer went up, strong, earnest
                  and fervent—the weary wept their weariness away—there came a soothing hush, a
                  solemn calm, resting upon the rocking waves of those spirits. At times, too, a
                  strange, beautiful chorus ascended, or a "Hallelujah" song.<pb n="398-399"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000200"/> And Mag threw her voice into the chorus, for some
                  of the music thrilled her soul.</p>
               <p>Mack had taken the time to pay his devoirs to all the belles he could find. He
                  came to Mag as she sent her voice quavering on the highest note of a
                  Hallelujah.</p>
               <p>"How much religion do you think there is down in that straw?"</p>
               <p>"Hush, Mack! I don't comprehend it in the least, and because I don't know, I will
                  not say that those people will not get religion there. Unfortunately, my
                  development has taught me to despise all excitement and passion, unless it is
                  under perfect control. They call it <emph>inspiration</emph>—but I believe the
                  days of the prophets passed ages ago."</p>
               <p>"These people are all getting intoxicated with excitement, and call it religion.
                  They are doing it to drown sorrow, just as that musical man yonder takes a glass
                  of something to make him happy. That pretty girl, too, has been the belle of
                  several revivals, to my certain knowledge. She 'falls from grace' as soon as the
                  excitement is over. That is right affecting now, the way she has thrown her arms
                  around her father's neck," he said, pointing to a beautiful girl of eighteen, in
                  the altar. "A pretty tableau. I intend to make love to her to-morrow. One of her
                  temperament would be a charming partner in a flirtation."</p>
               <p>"It does harm to say all these things, Mack. If I thought I could get any good by
                  the prayers of these people, I would ask them to pray for me. I believe in
                  religion, Mack."</p>
               <p>"I don't believe that much of it comes here. I believe in it, too. It is a fine
                  thing, and I intend to marry a woman who is a Christian. Religion is a grand thing
                  for a woman."</p>
               <p>Mag tried to comprehend the excitement. She, too, had rushed into forgetfulness by
                  the inspiration of music and painting. Then, in her devotion to the beautiful, she
                  had forgotten all fear of the future, and all sorrow for the past, by wrapping
                  herself in the elysium of rainbow-dreams. Was that religion? There were times,
                  too, when she worked gloriously on her book; or, throwing work aside, rushed into
                  the sweep of the inspiration of Homer and Virgil, and the Bible—Rufus Choate's
                  panacea for care. Was that religion?</p>
               <p>Cora Lanier inspired herself for society by opium; added a fresh lustre to her
                  eye, also a new sparkle to her wit, with a glass of champagne. The debauchee gave
                  himself up to physical intoxication; she acknowledged to intellectual
                  intoxication. Was this religion, a <emph>spiritual</emph> intoxication? A
                  something of which her nature had no experience? Mag doubted it all. Those who
                  abandoned themselves most to this spiritual enjoyment, yielded soonest to
                  temptation in their conflict with the world.</p>
               <p>Mag took the problem to her own little room in the cabin, and forgot it by
                  studying Chateaubriand's "Genius of Christianity." She was as much struck with the
                  errors, as with the truth of that "Genius."</p>
               <p>And she puzzled over faith itself. Was it a supernatural conversion of the nature?
                  Paul found it so. Paul worked supernaturally to the end with his faith. She, too,
                  had found it a powerful element; it had helped her, like a miraculous agent, when
                  her trial in Marion tested her strength. Was her seemingly superhuman energy a
                  gift of God in answer to prayer, as Bushnell taught; or was it as Comte had
                  taught, but the working of a law in her nature? Whatever it was, whether true or
                  false, whether law or Gospel, she had found it kneeling at some mercy-seat. If it
                  was merely a law of her nature—and she could almost believe it at times—who or
                  what made the nature, and the law to govern the nature, and what fastened the two
                  together, and kept them in operation, if not a God?</p>
               <p>And with all her reverie, she knelt down and said her prayers. They were entirely
                  different from those she heard at the altar, but more suited to her wants. Her
                  heart contradicted half their prayers.</p>
               <p>There was much to interest her at the camp-meeting. She tried to fathom human
                  thought, human hearts, and human experiences. She was trying to form an opinion of
                  men and things, for she did not trust or reverence human goodness.</p>
               <p>Colonel Walter introduced her to the master-spirits.</p>
               <p>Their own minister—a popular author too—told her that his nature
                     <emph>needed</emph> the stimulus of love. He must have home love, as a refuge
                  from the world-battle—the contest with evil.</p>
               <p>Mag had fought her battle at Marion, with no home love, with no human
                  sympathy—whether or not her nature had such <emph>necessities.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. Neely also told her that he should have been a maniac long before, but for his
                  Eden-home.</p>
               <p>"Had he ever been a skeptic?" Mag asked.</p>
               <p>"Yes, he had been all along that path; but now, the truths<pb n="400-401"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000201"/> of revelation were so clear, he could only wonder
                  that he ever doubted."</p>
               <p>Mag listened in marvellous wonder, and wished the revelation would become as clear
                  to her.</p>
               <p>"Had he ever known a female skeptic?"</p>
               <p>"No, thank God. Such a monster had never crossed his path. A woman had no excuse
                  for being a skeptic. A man might doubt God, thrown as he was into the world to
                  battle down iniquity, but a woman had no excuse; in the sanctuary of home, she
                  might believe in God and man; her nature might ripen for heaven under all sweet
                  influences. He would never marry a woman who doubted God. His wife must be a
                  member of Christ's Church, which was to the <emph>point.</emph>"</p>
               <p>Mag remembered that Cora Lanier joined that church to veil her guilt and passion
                  from the world's prying eyes. Theodore Parker says: "All modern wickedness must be
                  banked up with Christianity." But the existence of counterfeit coin proves the
                  belief in the existence of real coin.</p>
               <p>The author of the "Eclipse of Faith," gives the aphorism as an answer to Hume's
                  well-known argument against miracles. All nations of all ages have attempted to
                  establish their religions by means of miracles, for the belief in miracles is
                  universal. Some have believed false creeds, established by false miracles, but the
                  counterfeit, shows the existence of the real. Des Cartes says the conception of
                  God, proves the existence of God. "All modern wickedness must be banked up with
                  Christianity. If the state wishes to sow some eminently wicked seed, it ploughs
                  with the church." And Mag thought of all the wars carried on in the name of
                  Christ, to build up the ambition of men. To what good? God knew. God would take
                  care of his own truth. God was in it all, if there was a God—and she could not
                  doubt it now. God had ordered it all from the beginning; the Omnipotent,
                  Omnipresent, Omniscient God, who in wisdom and love had permitted the sin of Eden;
                  permitted evil, that a greater good might come of it. God had never made a mistake
                  in his <emph>decree</emph> that man should have a <emph>free will</emph> and sin.
                  If he had ever made one mistake, mankind were in unsafe hands; he might make other
                  mistakes. No; all the wars of sin and passion carried on in the name of Christ,
                  were permitted by God; the blood poured out on the battle-fields of ages, had
                  enriched the ages with experience for new developments of thought!... And solitary
                  bleeding hearts! God was with each heartthrob; he heard the ravens, watched the
                  sparrows, and numbered the very hairs of the head. Mag's solitary heart, ploughed
                  by sorrow and enriched by its own bleeding, was becoming fertile soil for grand
                  experiences and glorious developments.</p>
               <p>The appeal of the agent for the Southern Tract Society, interested Mag also,
                  having heard so much of northern discussion on the subject. She heard the plea now
                  from the southern pulpit.</p>
               <p>"Amid all the resources of these great United States, and all its plans for mercy,
                  there was but one tract society that could possibly supply the spiritual wants of
                  the servants. The publications of the other societies were of such a character,
                  that it was endangering their very altars and homes to permit them to be
                  circulated. In self-defence, then (to prevent their wives and daughters from
                  continual fear of danger), the South had been obliged to abandon those
                  publications (their tendency was to produce insurrection), and to establish their
                  own societies. In Nashville was now established their one Southern Tract Society,
                  the only one that could give the Gospel to their poor servants."</p>
               <p>And then came the earnest, tearful, eloquent appeal that southern men should
                  support nobly and generously their own institutions, that their households might
                  not be deprived of the Gospel tidings, and that their servants might be made glad
                  and strong with the good news of salvation. The appeal reached the hearts and
                  purses of southern men—many gave tears with their gold.</p>
               <p>"Sunday is the most religious day of the entertainment," said Mack. "You must put
                  on all your glory to-day. The saints come out in their choicest apparel now. You
                  will see all satins, moire-antiques, laces, diamonds, rubies and pearls to-day.
                  You must be sure and wear your flounces, Miss Barclay."</p>
               <p>Mag wore her flounces. At night there came a whispered report that there was an
                  insurrection on foot among the slaves; it was only a whisper. But timid ladies
                  shuddered, and every master ordered home his servants, and the night police was
                  doubled. During the political abolition excitement of the last presidential
                  campaign, rumors of insurrection were common, and in many cities and villages all
                  the arms were bought up by the whites, to<pb n="402-403" xml:id="VAC6426-00000202"
                  /> guard against rumored danger, and to prevent servants from making trouble. At
                  that time, too, the servants were deprived of their usual holidays. When the
                  excitement had subsided, their privileges were renewed. On account of this
                  suspicion, the servants at this camp-meeting were deprived of their usual revival
                  times among themselves, with their own ministers.</p>
               <p>Mag left the grounds before the "breaking up." Mack offered her a seat in his
                  buggy home. They went to Uniontown, spent the night at the house of a friend, with
                  music and merriment. And all went home the next day. Home! Her first return
                  home!</p>
               <p>Lily, the poodle, greeted her, and Tip, the house-dog, nearly eat her up, as well
                  as knocked her down, with gladness. And all three went "kiting" over the grounds,
                  through gardens and groves, Mag gathering her arms full of flowers, and tearing a
                  dozen or so of her flounces, went pirouetting (Mack said "pirooting") all over the
                  halls, piazzas, balconies, and verandas. Afterward she proceeded to the grand
                  piano and murdered any quantity of music, which did not disturb Mack, because he
                  did not hear it, and could not sing a note if he had. Lily, the poodle,
                  accompanied her by singing, dancing, frisking, and cavorting, without any serious
                  damage to himself, Mag, or the piano; and lastly, she, Mag, closed the piano and
                  the morning's exercises by ascending with Lily to her own room, and writing, with
                  Lily's sympathetic aid, a—a—a love-letter to—to—Charles Atherton Moore! which, of
                  course, never reached him, as he chanced to be at the antipodes, and only served
                  to prove to Mag herself that she had not forgotten him, if she was skeptical on
                  that point. Nay, it might have convinced her that she had cultivated for him a
                  most enthusiastic regard, notwithstanding his iniquities with Cora Lanier.</p>
               <p>And when the letter was finished, and the spirit was still chafing for further
                  life and exercise, a strange impulse seized her to write to Frank Ross, and tell
                  him her whole soul. She bit her lips to see if she was not dreaming—it seemed so
                  natural to tell Frank everything, and Frank was living somewhere, and she wanted
                  to tell him that she had grown strong, and faith had come to her.</p>
               <p>She repeated to herself, Franklin's creed of a Divine Providence. The duty of men
                  was to worship God, the worship most acceptable to him being good deeds to
                  humanity. She rehearsed Webster's faith in Christianity, as engraved upon his
                  funeral monument. She wondered at the cruel meaning of the "Remorse," that John
                  Randolph declared was hurrying him down to death.</p>
               <p>Again she appreciated Jefferson's "Philosophy of Jesus;" also his philosophy of
                  life. "The most fortunate of us, in our journey through life, frequently meet with
                  calamities and misfortunes which may greatly afflict us; and to fortify our minds
                  against the attacks of these calamities and misfortunes, should be one of the
                  principal studies and endeavors of our lives. The only method of doing this is to
                  assume a perfect resignation to the Divine Will; to consider whatever does happen,
                  must happen, and that by our uneasiness, we cannot prevent the blow before it does
                  fall, but we may add to its force after it has fallen."</p>
               <p>There were often days now when she was buoyant of heart, days when she believed in
                  the Supernatural with Bushnell; in the "simple faith," which could work miracles
                  in answer to prayer. There were days when she went to God and asked him to help
                  her on her book, and believed that he was doing it. There were days when she asked
                  God to save Charles Moore and herself for an earthly love, as a foretaste of that
                  heavenly marriage, and she believed God would do it. That faith, whether it was
                  false or true, made her strong and happy; the happiness, when once passed, could
                  not be taken from her. It was well to cheat the hours into happiness; better
                  beguile them with happy hopes, than miserable fears of evil. "Sufficient unto the
                  day should be the evil thereof." The evil might never come. What a pity, then, to
                  torture her heart with groundless fears of evil. Even if it came, it could not rob
                  her of the happiness caused by a false hope.</p>
               <p>She was eager to tell Frank of her new philosophy of religion. Mr. Chamberlain was
                  welcome to call her insane now. If this was insanity, it was sweeter and better
                  than health, and her finger was on her pulse now. She knew she could control the
                  madness.</p>
               <p>Yet all this restless eagerness, if Mag had been a man, would have driven her into
                  wild wanderings over the earth.... The spirit must utter itself. In this southern
                  land she could not go over mountain, valley, and lake, as at Glenlyn, and she was
                  thankful for the inspiration of any occurrence that could give that restless
                  spirit life in action. A thunder-storm—a southern hurricane—anything that<pb
                     n="404-405" xml:id="VAC6426-00000203"/> revealed power, to her was a God-send—a
                  great joy; she permitted her spirit to become intoxicated then; and when the
                  lightnings were playing, she read the grand old masters, and thanked the God she
                  so often doubted, for the companionship of night and storm. Then she was not
                  alone.</p>
               <p>Curious discussions came off, at times, in the drawing-room at Cedar Grove. Mr.
                  Marschall, a young artist from Marion, of extraordinary talent, just from Europe,
                  gave her an introduction to thought and customs in the old world, that made her
                  world new. They discussed abstract beauty, instead of the ideal—and the element
                  that could inspire love. The artist declared, laughing, yet in cool earnest, that
                  "the only lady whom he ever wished to marry, was his own sister; she was the
                  fulfillment of his ideal woman; but since Abraham's time, such a marriage was
                  against law, and he considered his love persecuted by the Fates."</p>
               <p>The colonel and Mack one day helped Mag into a somewhat audacious experiment. A
                  Kentucky colonel, who had shot his man in a duel, abetted the iniquity.</p>
               <p>As usual, they had been discussing the philosophy of religion, especially of
                  Christianity. The Kentuckian had made out a strong argument for fatalism, and
                  completely annihilated that of a young minister, who unfortunately had never
                  tested his own theories, and was innocent of all knowledge of the weapons of
                  logic.</p>
               <p>The colonel also declared that "Mag's theology was abominable stuff; her
                  predestination was so strong, it was nothing but fatalism. All that was meant in
                  the Bible, by God's fore-knowledge, was that with God, the present, past, and
                  future, was one eternal now."</p>
               <p>Mag laughed, declaring that "the definition was sufficiently blinding for all
                  practical purposes, especially to the comprehension of a skeptic."</p>
               <p>"She believed some wonderful things," the colonel said.</p>
               <p>"And he believed some miraculous doctrines."</p>
               <p>"She ought to believe them."</p>
               <p>"No matter whether she ought or not, how could she, if she could not? Belief was
                  not controlled by the will. And no matter how sincere a poor wretch might be in
                  his doubts of Christianity, not one man in twenty of the educated ministers of
                  Christ's Gospel would do more to help a forlorn sinner out of the mud, than
                  anathematize him for daring to question the Bible."</p>
               <p>"That was a libel on Christ's ministers and church."</p>
               <p>"He could not prove it a libel."</p>
               <p>"She should prove it a libel. She should write letters from a sincere skeptic to
                  some of the best minds in America, and he would wager anything under heaven that
                  she would receive answers from them that would be to the point."</p>
               <p>And Mag, who was not troubled with reverence for human goodness or greatness—more
                  was the pity—took the wager, and wrote the letters, reading them to the company
                  for their approval of the sincerity of the skepticism.</p>
               <p>Mag was liberal in her views of Christianity. Five gentlemen of different
                  denominations were selected to be the victims. Prof. ——, of Andover, Mass.,
                  Congregational; Bishop ——, of Georgia, Methodist; Archbishop ——, of Mobile, Roman
                  Catholic; Rev. Mr. ——, of Marion, Episcopalian; Rev. Mr. ——, of New Hampshire,
                  Unitarian. We give a specimen of the style of documents that were sent to these
                  persecuted gentlemen. Mag wrote them from her heart, dated Doubting Castle, while
                  imprisoned by giant Despair.</p>

                        <div type="letter">
                           <p>"DEAR SIR: Will you pardon the presumption of a doubter who dares
                              trouble one of Christ's ministers with skepticism? Pardon a skeptic,
                              now sitting in darkness and the shadow of death, praying for 'more
                              light.' A solitaire has found the magnificent gloom of solitude more
                              an oppression than a delight to the soul; there are no loving eyes
                              looking down from the midnight stars; the only voices breaking the
                              silence of solitude are like those of the daughters of the horse-leech
                              continually crying, 'Give, give!' They have cried to the unknown God,
                              asking him the questions that have troubled human hearts in all ages,
                              from Job and Jeremiah, pouring out their terrible cursing on the days
                              of their birth, to Solomon, forsaking him who bestowed wisdom, and
                              honor, and might and glory, for 'woman's idle love.' They have cried
                              at the shrine of the unknown God, and if there came answers to their
                              cry, no priest has as yet interpreted the mysteries of the oracles.
                              You are a priest of the so-called Most High God; will you tell a
                              doubting sinner the hidden meaning of these things? Why are these
                              things so? There is something in our natures beseeching us forever and
                              forever, 'Oh, come let us fall down and worship!' We have bowed
                              ourselves to pour out our adoration, and found ourselves prostrate<pb
                                 n="406-407" xml:id="VAC6426-00000204"/> before—not idols of wood
                              and stone, the work of men's hands, nor idols of sweet human flesh and
                              blood, but fallen angels, fiends, who mocked us, deriding us with
                              bitter scorn, saying, 'There is no Christ.' That 'bastard Hebrew baby'
                              was neither God nor the Son of God! There is no atonement—no refuge
                              from the torture and agony that is making such mad riot and havoc of
                              our nature.</p>
                           <p>"Can you, as God's apostle to those in darkness, drive away the shadow
                              of a great horror, haunting the doubter at mid-noon and midnight? Can
                              you teach me to believe in God? You may say that books should teach
                              the skeptic; there has been no one to guide this doubter in the choice
                              of books, and those read have perhaps wrecked the best part of the
                              nature. Can you teach the doubter faith? one who has learned Satan's
                              anguish, 'Me miserable! which way I turn is hell, and in the lowest
                              deep, a lower still threatening to devour me, opens wide?' It is
                              terrible to feel that in the contest with evil, the soul, if immortal,
                              is being dragged down to the pit, degenerating daily to a death,
                              compared with which the dreamless sleep of the Sadducees would be
                              heaven. If, sir, you consider it a presumption, the present asking for
                              aid to escape that death, will you forgive, before you cast the
                              skeptic out? At least the pariah may then cultivate the taste to enjoy
                              hellish experiences, and will then as now remain,</p>

               <p>The letter was decidedly womanly—but Mag lost her wager, for she received answers
                  from all but the Roman Catholic Archbishop.</p>
               <p>After a few months she received a very short, very kind note from the wife of the
                  first-mentioned, advising her to pray "Lord, help mine unbelief," also to pray to
                  be saved from that "pride of intellect which would search into things not to be
                  revealed."</p>
               <p>Mag followed the advice, as well as she was able, and was grateful for it.</p>
               <p>The bishop from Georgia mistook her for a gentleman, and wrote to the "Dear
                  Brother," that his difficulties were not intellectual, as he supposed, but the
                  result of a solitary life and morbid nerves—told him(!) to leave books and dreams,
                  and go to work—make it his business to comfort the orphan!</p>
               <p>Mag declared she would do it every time!</p>
               <p>If he (!) would learn the deep meaning of that scripture, "Do God's will," he
                  would never be troubled again with doubts.</p>
               <p>All of which is truth as pure and undiluted with error, as truth is ever found on
                  earth, undoubtedly. Mag knew it, afterward.</p>
               <p>From the other gentlemen she received the kindest possible letters, books,
                  pamphlets, and documents, till the post-office must have ached, and the
                  post-master began to mistrust that she was a literary lady.</p>
               <p>All this added wonderful interest to her monotonous life. She got glimpses of the
                  world; had communion with minds that had thought and suffered, and grown strong
                  and earnest, and she was not obliged to resort to thunder-storms or tornadoes to
                  rouse her spirit to companionship. It might have been a wrong step, but she never
                  regretted it.</p>
               <p>Time went on. Mrs. Walter was haunted by the spirits of mirth and mischief. One
                  day, as everybody and his wife were preparing to go to Greensborough to lay the
                  corner stone of a new southern college, the spirit of repentance took possession
                  of her, and she went straightway to the presiding elder, and confessed to him all
                  these sins of Mag's.</p>
               <p>The reason why she did it, seemed to be a perverse inclination to bring Mag into
                  trouble with the bishop from Georgia, who was to deliver the address on that
                  important occasion.</p>
               <p>The bishop was a friend of Colonel Walter, and the colonel threatened love with a
                  vengeance, which must always be endured when it cannot be avoided.</p>
               <p>To Greensborough they all went. The colonel drove his own magnificent grey
                  mustangs, with his lady and Margaret in the rockaway. Mag, Sallie, and Mack went
                  in the carriage, with Mrs. Walter's gigantic bay horses. Mag and Mack discussed
                  horse-flesh, and so forth, on that journey. They sympathized on their tastes in
                  horse-flesh, appreciating the glory of physical strength, beauty and grace—riding
                  races, and all that style of thing. What else they said, as they rode through the
                  green prairies, and crossed the creeks shaded with the silver-blossomed catalpas
                  and magnolias—is it not all recorded in the book of fate?</p>
               <p>Everybody was at Greensborough to see the laying of the corner-stone of the new
                  college. Their party took the front seat, beneath the very droppings of
                  the—sanctissimi! Mr. Henry, Mag's patron, the father of one of her<pb n="408"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000205"/> pupils, placed himself as her right-hand man, and
                  volunteered to point out to her the honorables, as they arrayed themselves on the
                  platform; also to fan the flies off, and to say and do any number of other
                  wonderfully agreeable things.</p>
               <p>They watched and discussed the bishops, D.D.'s, honorables, generals, colonels,
                  and polloi, as they went up the rostrum, and Mag peered earnestly into all their
                  faces, to discover, if possible, what stuff these Cæsars were made of, that they
                  were grown so great, and failed to solve the mystery; she concluded that
                  greatness, like Paul's philosophy, was a several-sided affair, being all things to
                  all men, and some things to some women, the latter of which she was one.</p>
               <p>After some cabalistic exercises of the masonic fraternity, a pouring out of wine,
                  and corn, and oil—probably to feed the college and make it grow—the Hon. Henry
                  Hilliard made an oration.</p>
               <p>It was a southern speech for a southern college; its eloquence was worthy the
                  orator and the people. Some of its "sentiments" interested Mag, as she had been
                  endowed with "northern prejudices."</p>
               <p>The South would remind the North that charity should commence at home. That
                  business policy safest for each man, province, and nation, was to attend to its
                  own particular business, and leave alone the affairs of neighboring men,
                  provinces, and nations. "First, remove the beam from thine own eye, and then shalt
                  thou see clearly to remove the mote from thy brother's eye," the Scriptures had
                  said. The North must learn this policy; its aggressions were becoming absolutely
                  unbearable; all that the South could do, would be to rise in self-defence and free
                  itself from northern influence. The South must have its own literature, its own
                  education; the influence of northern teachers must be done away; it was corrupting
                  to southern institutions. They were that day founding a southern college; it must
                  be put entirely in charge of southern professors, etc., etc.</p>
               <p>All of which Mag noticed with profound respect.</p>
               <p>Mr. Henry made a very entertaining remark to her, to call off her attention; would
                  have offered her a magnolia blossom from the arch of flowers, if he could have
                  reached it. Mag considered magnolias as splendid southern institutions; also,
                  human nature, at times!</p>
               <p>"Please hush, sir," she whispered in reply. "I am<pb n="409"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000206"/> deeply interested in the discourse. Mr. Hilliard is
                  looking at you besides—and I like him. I am a New England girl, and proud of it,
                  and wish I could tell him so. I would make him like me too—I know I could. I would
                  tell him that God honored me by permitting me to be born in New England; and if I
                  should tell him so, he would be as deferential to me as to Mrs. James Buchanan, if
                  she were a supposable personage."</p>
               <p>"And there is a problem for him to solve," said Mr. Henry. "How is northern
                  influence to be done away from the South? There is quite a large proportion of the
                  element to be got rid of."</p>
               <p>"And," added Mag, "since, with but rare exceptions, neither southern men nor women
                  ever become teachers. It is not in their style of solving the problem of a life
                  destiny to teach young humanity book-knowledge."</p>
               <p>Bishop Pierce rose for the concluding oration. He looks one of nature's noblemen,
                  great in goodness; the signet of royalty seems stamped on every feature—is radiant
                  in his eye.</p>
               <p>His oration was on the wants of the age, more education, and that sterner want,
                  more religion to guide progression down the ages. The discourse impressed the
                  audience, as did the man; it was chaste and sublime.</p>
               <p>The exercises were over at last; and there followed the Babel of confusion worse
                  confounded. The party from Cedar Grove kept their places, waiting for Colonel
                  Walter, who was on the rostrum. Mag was astonished by a greeting from Dr. H—— of
                  Montgomery, who had befriended her at Marion.</p>
               <p>"The bishop informed me a few weeks since, that he had received a letter from a
                  brother, by name of Barclay, on skepticism, and asked me if I knew such a brother.
                  Did you write that letter, Miss Barclay?"</p>
               <p>Mag was thunderstruck. Her heart gave an immense thump, which sent the blood in
                  torrents to her face, making her brain reel.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," she gasped, at last.</p>
               <p>"Was the letter written in good faith?"</p>
               <p>Imagine her feelings. How could a skeptical letter be written in faith? It was a
                  contradiction of terms. She might say in truth, "Yes, sir;" or she might with
                  truth say, "No, sir." Truth being, in this instance, as usual, a double-faced
                  affair. After revolving the two faces intently<pb n="410-411"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000207"/> tently before her mental gaze, she decided on a
                  deliberate affirmative.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
               <p>Mag might have been overwhelmed; but just then, to pile up the agony, Ossa on
                  Pelion, she saw Colonel Walter's tall, dignified figure, crowned with white locks,
                  making its way through the crowd toward her. He introduced to her bewildered
                  senses, the bishop! How Mag pitied the afflicted bishop! Such a woeful expression
                  of puzzlement struggled into life on his benign countenance! He looked down on her
                  "stately and loving," as a shepherd might have looked on a stray lamb from his
                  fold. Mag longed to ask him for his blessing.</p>
               <p>Both the bishop and Mag survived, to Mag's astonishment.</p>
               <p>As they were leaving the grounds, the presiding elder, to whom Mrs. Walter had
                  "confessed," came upon them.</p>
               <p>"I asked the bishop a few moments ago about that letter. He was wonderfully
                  interested, and informed me that he had just been introduced to the gentleman's
                  wife!"</p>
               <p>"Such is life in its most unmitigated forms," said Mag, ready to cry, only,
                  unfortunately, she could not. It was not her wont.</p>
               <p>They partook of the princely hospitality of Mr. Nelson, nephew of Mrs. Walter;
                  dined with Bishop Paine, Hon. Mr. Hilliard, Judge Moore, afterward governor of
                  Alabama, with other honorables, and Mag listened to a unique discussion on the
                  propriety and impossibility of abolishing northern female teachers from southern
                  schools.</p>
               <p>Colonel Walter got nervous for Mag, and made some very desperate efforts to call
                  off her attention. However, Judge Moore relieved the colonel by a well-timed
                  remark.</p>
               <p>"I have been for two years a teacher myself. I have daughters, and I know that
                  there is no better way for them to acquire discipline of mind and character, than
                  by becoming teachers."</p>
               <p>The colonel drew a long breath, as if some threatened danger had been averted.</p>
               <p>A thousand unutterable thoughts crowded Mag's brain the next day, as they visited
                  the luxurious home of Mr. Walter's brother-in-law, near Marion. In strolling
                  through the grounds, they came to an inclosure, hedged in with arbor vitæ, so high
                  and thick the eye could not penetrate within. They entered a latticed gate, and
                  stood awestruck struck among marble monuments, over which thousands of the white
                  flowers of Cape Jessamine were blossoming. The dead were sleeping beneath the
                  marble and the flowers. There came thought again of the beautiful dead far away.
                  Was the grave the end of all perfection? No! no! no! a thousand times no! Thank
                  God, "the dead shall rise again—this corruptible shall put on incorruption, and
                  this mortal shall put on immortality!"</p>

               <head>XXIX. WHAT THE SPIRIT AND THE TEMPTER SAID.</head>
               <p>THE months rolled on. News came to Magdalene Barclay that May Burton was slowly
                  dying. An uncontrollable desire seized her to see May before she went to the
                  spiritland. She had other business, too, in New England, and to New England she
                  would go, and to the world's end, perhaps, for she had grown daring since she had
                  been thrown on herself for sympathy and companionship.</p>
               <p>"Colonel Walter," said she one day, "the idea has possessed me of late, that I
                  must visit New England."</p>
               <p>"I always knew you were 'possessed' with strange ideas, and that is one of them!
                  You have no business in New England!"</p>
               <p>"Please, sir!" said Mag, with her most coquettish, pleading tones.</p>
               <p>"It is midwinter. Wait till summer, and we will all go with you."</p>
               <p>"I don't feel as if I could possibly wait a minute! Please, sir, say yes, or my
                  heart will break into a thousand pieces."</p>
               <p>"Shocking! As if you ever possessed a heart! Though you are possessed of most
                  unaccountable whims and things. Yes, you may go. When will you be back?"</p>
               <p>"As soon as possible, sir. Can I do anything for you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, stop in Montgomery and make a speech to the legislature. The Canebrake
                  people have a petition about these Sixteenth Section Lands. As it is, the public
                     money<pb n="412-413" xml:id="VAC6426-00000208"/> is of but little use. The
                  Section people are mostly too lazy to send their children to school, though it is
                  at their doors. We want to take the money and endow a Female College. We will make
                  you the president of the college."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, sir. I will make the speech to the legislature. No doubt, sir, it will
                  pass by the house with a storm."</p>
               <p>Mag went to Mr. Henry, her patron.</p>
               <p>"What in the name of wonder do you want to go North for?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"I have a secret for you. I have been writing a book."</p>
               <p>"I always expected you was doing something desperate. Let me see it!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir. But it is not finished, and it puzzles me. My heroine does not behave
                  to suit me. I intended her as a model-lady, and, in spite of me, she is growing
                  strongminded, and says such naughty things, she frightens me. I am afraid she will
                  ruin herself; she is turning out a perfect Lola Montez on my hands, and I intended
                  her for the Madonna. I must go and ask Dr. Barker what to do with her. I started
                  to write a very pious book, too, and the thing has run away with me, and I am in
                  trouble."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps I can help you out."</p>
               <p>Mr. Henry read the manuscript and commented.</p>
               <p>"It is a queer production, but on the whole, I like it. Your heroine is a saucy
                  thing—not well brought up—deserved more whippings than she ever got; I never saw
                  but one girl like her in all my life, and I have seen lots of the animals. The
                  over-pious critics may damn your book, and some will say it is pedantic—and some
                  will call your children's smart speeches failures—and you, poor child, you'll have
                  a time of it with them all!"</p>
               <p>"And I have written every page with a prayer. As for the pedantry and that sort of
                  thing, I think it deserves a 'scoring,' and so I intend to take it meekly."</p>
               <p>"Well, go and get the thing published. I will furnish you with the funds
                  myself."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, sir."</p>
               <p>"But," thought. Mag, "if the thing has not stamina enough to support itself, it
                  may go overboard again." Then she blessed him with all her soul and might for his
                  kindness, and prepared to go North.</p>
               <p>The night before her exodus from the Canebrake was one when all the elements in
                  heaven and earth were at war. She listened through the live-long night to the rain
                  upon the roof, and dreamed waking dreams of May Burton and Frank Ross, of Charles
                  Moore and her book. In the morning the rain was pouring still.</p>
               <p>"Whoso regardeth the clouds shall not reap," she said to Mack, to convince him
                  that it was best to go through the mud to the depot.</p>
               <p>"I am at your service, through fire, water and mud."</p>
               <p>So they went, through mud and water, and were thankful to reach the fire at
                  last.</p>
               <p>Mag remembered the horrible fate of her Sunday hat, in her first travels. Being
                  taught by experience all the tribulations incident to a bandbox, she now put her
                  Sunday hat into a new tin hat-box—put said hat-box into the buggy, and put herself
                  in after it, before they started. Mag always had an affection for a Sunday hat; it
                  must have been in her Puritan blood. Her present pet was black, like her Sunday
                  flounces; it had black flowers within and black plumes without. Mag was fond of
                  those things too.</p>
               <p>The rain poured down; but she stopped with Mack to say her adieux to the beautiful
                  lady who had sent her flowers during the summer. They took a parting glass of
                  wine. Mag drank to the success of the lady and Mack, in their every flirtation
                  with beaux and belles; they drank to her success on her book, promising to
                  electioneer for it, in rain and sunshine, and so they went their ways.</p>
               <p>Mack and Mag took their way through the mud. Miss Mary, with those clear, brown,
                  still eyes, watched them as the horses waded, plunged, wallowed and rolled in the
                  unmitigated mud of the Alabama limestone prairies. Unmitigated? No, for at last
                  they came to a creek that was in danger of overflow. The horses plunged into the
                  rolling water, the waves surged over their backs. Mag was busy watching the
                  romance of their noses floating above the tide, and forgot that the buggy was
                  following those elevated noses, and that also her Sunday hat was in the
                  buggy—forgot that she herself was sitting in the buggy—never dreaming but she was
                  sailing through the air on rainbows, till she found the skirts of her garments,
                  and her Sunday hat, all undergoing baptism by immersion. Language could not
                  express her feelings.</p>
               <p>"They say love sweetens every sorrow," commented Mack. "A nice dish of it would be
                  apropos now. Wonder if our 'proposal' would not be a comfort in this emergency.
                  Are you ready for it?"</p>
               <pb n="414-415" xml:id="VAC6426-00000209"/>
               <p>"What an unconscionable flirt you are, Mack! What did ever possess you to get into
                  such habits? It is bad business! You get a bad name by it, and some lady will be
                  sure to pay you in your own coin. You may 'confess' the particulars of your
                  experiences, however. I intend to put them in my book—The Adventures of a Southern
                  Male Coquette. You may commence on Miss Morton first."</p>
               <p>"Well, I will tell you about that. How shall I commence?"</p>
               <p>"In your own style."</p>
               <p>"'Once on a time,' a fine old uncle of mine conceived the fortunate thought of
                  leaving me the snug little sum of about eighty thousand dollars, which sum being
                  reported about the country as toward a million, I immediately became a young man
                  of consideration, to all southern belles, who are captivated by such charms. Among
                  others, Miss Morton paid me her addresses. Being very young and verdant at the
                  time, and neither wise nor pious, I reciprocated her affection; but afterward I
                  saw Miss Hattie, and took a wonderful fancy to her, because she would not take a
                  fancy to me."</p>
               <p>"Ah, yes, forbidden fruit! But I intend to make the proposals myself whenever I
                  meet my destiny. There will be some miracle wrought to tell me that I have met my
                  fate. Do you suppose that you will know your other self when she first comes into
                  your presence?"</p>
               <p>"My instincts are at fault about it. For the life of me I cannot conceive now
                  whether my other name is Mary, Magdalene, or Alice."</p>
               <p>"Alice is a sweet name—let it be Alice. But how about Hattie?"</p>
               <p>"That name of Hattie has a charm. She was such a mischievous thing. But I declare
                  I did not intend to tell her I loved her, Miss Mag. A fellow is forced into love
                  by circumstances at times. This love is an odd sensation, anyhow. What do you know
                  about it? You know such alarming things, I am afraid of you."</p>
               <p>"I declare, Mack, I never mistrusted you could be so modest. I'll promise never to
                  propose to you, if you will tell me about Miss Hattie."</p>
               <p>"Wasn't she the mischief, though! And how Harper did love her! I never knew a man
                  to love another as he loved her. And his jealousy drove me into love. I tell you
                  there is no accounting for love! I should not be astonished any day to find
                  myself"——</p>
               <p>"You will never get to the story. What about Harper?"</p>
               <p>"His jealousy? How it forced me in love? He called me into his room one day. I saw
                  the devil in his eye as I entered, and two pistols lying on the table. I began to
                  be in love as I saw the pistols. I carelessly took one of them in my hand as I sat
                  down, which softened the look in his eye like a miracle. I asked him pleasantly
                  what he wanted of me. He replied earnestly that he wanted to know my intentions
                  with regard to Miss Hattie. I told him that I did not consider myself under any
                  obligations to let him know my intentions. 'Well,' he said, 'he was as solemn as
                  death with his intentions, for he loved her as he loved his own soul, and if I was
                  merely flirting with her, it would be honorable in me to make way for him.' I felt
                  very much of a sensation of love for Miss Hattie just then, and so told him that
                  the field was open for both of us—I should win the lady if I could, and he might
                  do the same. Miss Mag, it was the prettiest proposal I ever made, and the hardest
                  won battle I ever tried. You ought to have heard my pleading. Hattie was on the
                  shy, and played witch to perfection. I never was so badly enchanted! For three
                  hours I did some of the most devoted talking! No mortal ever did a more thorough
                  business at wooing. She would not begin to say 'yes.' For two weeks she led me in
                  the game. I pleaded with a fervor and eloquence that would have astonished Burke
                  himself. And was not she inspiring? I tell you the sensation goes down to my boots
                  while I think of it! I had not been in earnest till I began to think I should lose
                  her. The puss would not give me any sort of answer. At last I was determined to
                  force her to some kind of terms, so one day while we were riding, I stopped the
                  horse under a big oak, like that one yonder—it was not raining then as now.
                  Suppose we try the same experiment now in the rain. I told her that the horse
                  should not leave that tree until she gave me some sort of answer, either yes or
                  no. Well, the horse stood till it was tired; the flies got almost as devotedly in
                  love with him as I was with her. Not a word would she say. I began to think it was
                  a desperate case. I told her, however, I was satisfied with her society; we would
                  stay there till night-fall or doomsday—we would not budge a foot till she gave me
                  her answer."</p>
               <p>"What were you thinking of about then?"</p>
               <p>"A great many things—housekeeping and all that sort of business—love in a cottage,
                  you know!"</p>
               <pb n="416-417" xml:id="VAC6426-00000210"/>
               <p>"In a cottage! I thought you taste ran to castles in the air?"</p>
               <p>"I never fancied castles; my tastes are simple, and end in cottages."</p>
               <p>"What did she say?"</p>
               <p>"She said Yes!"</p>
               <p>"Can you describe your sensations then?"</p>
               <p>"I went out of my head for a while. It took my senses entirely. That 'Yes' was
                  mighty sweet, Miss Mag. I never heard anything to equal it. I wonder if Alice
                  could say it? I declare I'll ask her. I told Hattie—what went to the stars. How
                  many times have you ever heard the like? You would make me see stars if I should
                  tell you the same. I dare not venture yet."</p>
               <p>"What came of it?"</p>
               <p>"After a few days I began to reflect. I did not want to marry, after all. Cousin
                  Frank asked me what under heaven I was about—I deserved a lesson in
                  pistol-shooting. I told him the whole—just how Harper led me into it. Frank told
                  me I could get out of it honorably, and I had better do it, or he would shoot me.
                  All I had to do was to give Hattie half a shadow of a hint, and she would send me
                  off, with documents so strong they could never be redeemed."</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"The next time I visited her, I told her that, after all, I believed I was as much
                  in love with Miss Mag Barclay as herself! Great heavens! You should have seen her.
                  I saw more stars in fifteen minutes, than in all my life before or since! It was a
                  shower of meteors. She blew me sky high! If another man ever got such a 'kicking,'
                  I am sorry for him!"</p>
               <p>"Well."</p>
               <p>"I was worse in love than ever. I begged her pardon a thousand times, but not
                  another 'Yes' could I get out of her, and I had to make the best of it."</p>
               <p>"How was that?"</p>
               <p>"I went to Harper; told him the field was clear for him. She had annihilated me.
                  The fellow thought I was fooling him. I answered him that it was God's truth; I
                  had proposed, and been refused; she had rejected me past all hope."</p>
               <p>"You did?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; and the tears sprung to the fellow's eyes, when he found I was in earnest.
                  He grasped my hand with a blessing that made me almost as happy as the 'Yes' that
                  Hattie once gave me. In a week they were engaged. One day, as he returned from a
                  ride with her, he loaned me his buggy, and persuaded her to ride with me, at my
                  request. I told her then that Harper knew from me, that she had discarded me, and
                  she might, in honor, tell him so. The dear little soul! she put both her hands in
                  mine, and told me I was one noble fellow, and if I would, we should be fast
                  friends forever. And that was blissful! You and I then had a grand time at the
                  wedding, you remember. That's all."</p>
               <p>Just here, Mack and Mag reached the depot, and betook themselves to the fire. Mag
                  surveyed her bedraggled dress, and the withered flowers and wilted plumes upon her
                  bonnet. She squeezed her wet shoes over her hand to dry them into shape. She
                  screwed, twisted, and pressed several handkerchiefs and veils into her Sunday hat,
                  to shape that affair. The wrinkles came straight in her shoes, and then in her
                  hat, and of course in her face. The sunshine came out there, as well as in the sky
                  to dry the garments and the weather.</p>
               <p>And she was proud of her hat when it was righted; she was always proud of it when
                  she remembered it. She put it on her head, instead of in the hat-box, and
                  preserved it there till she reached New York.</p>
               <p>"Be sure and come back soon," was Mack's parting injunction.</p>
               <p>"Tell Miss Alice to be sure and invite me to the wedding."</p>
               <p>"I think it will come off very suddenly—if she can be caught."</p>
               <p>"I am very anxious for her to reform you. Good bye."</p>
               <p>There followed three days of almost unbroken solitude in the busy world of travel,
                  in which Mag's spirit took all the variations of the compass, from the wildest
                  flights of careering joy to the saddest of all pitiful wailing. She talked to her
                  troublesome heart; it was upbraiding her, longing to vindicate itself to Charles
                  Moore; longing to tell him that she had not become false nor a hypocrite, in being
                  for years a solitary rover. She had been searching continually for the beautiful,
                  the good, and the true. Her heart had not yet been tempted beyond refuge with all
                  its wonderful capacities of loving and hating.</p>
               <p>She had been a fool in saying there was no God; but<pb n="418-419"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000211"/> would not that little pale-faced girl yonder say it
                  in her heart, before its throbbings were hushed in the grave? It was a "wee bit,"
                  tiny girl, a little minstrel girl who entered the cars with her almost baby
                  brother, just before they reached Philadelphia. And Mag gave the child money, and
                  thought she gave her love, and took infinite credit to herself for
                  it—vain-glorious thing—and just then the cars ran off the track with a tremendous
                  crash, that nearly knocked the apple out of the child's hand that Mag was putting
                  into it. But no lives were lost, only the baggage shockingly smashed (Mag's hat
                  was on her head), and one old negro knocked under the stove-pipe, when the forward
                  car, by upsetting, tried to pitch the rest of the passengers out of the windows.
                  They mostly crawled out through the upper windows, however, the under ones being
                  connected with the ground instead of the fresh breezes of heaven and freedom.</p>
               <p>And oh, the sorrowful faces that she saw in New York! One voice that she heard
                  haunted her for days. It was on Sunday that she heard it, for she reached New York
                  on Saturday night. It was the voice of an old, wrinkled, haggard-faced woman, who
                  sat on the steps of one of the Broadway palaces, and held out her hand entreating,
                  "Money, money, for the love of God!" Mag smiled down cheerily, and answered her:
                  "God knows, I would give you oceans of it, mother, if I had it, to go on
                  interest." She added to herself, "till I, too, am a wretched beggar, old, haggard,
                  and grey-haired."</p>
               <p>Sunday found her at No. 66, Astor House, tired of solitude, and bound to extract
                  amusement or entertainment out of the great, solitary, false-hearted world. She
                  had but little admiration for it—but little hope for it—but little fear of it, and
                  no reverence, even for its opinions. She had grown brave in it, because she
                  despised it. She thought of Brutus, and his conclusion of the whole matter, "Oh,
                  Virtue! I have worshipped thee as a real good; but thou art an empty name, and the
                  slave of fortune!" And thought was an inspiration—she felt free in that Babel—free
                  as upon her native mountains.</p>
               <p>It would be pastime to go to church—but her poor, drowned hat! She perched it on
                  her hand and looked at it—she perched it on her head and looked at it. There were
                  angles acute and obtuse in it; there were right angles and curves, and diagrams
                  that it would have puzzled Augustus Smith, LL.D., himself, to demonstrate
                  mathematically. A bright thought struck Mag; she would rejuvenate the thing. She
                  rung for a chambermaid—sent for an iron, although it was Sunday, and she was near
                  the land of the Puritans; she heated the iron on the grate, wet the bonnet,
                  smoothed out the wrinkles, ironed them dry over a few towels that she crushed into
                  it, pulled out the laces, shook out the plumes, poked out the flowers, placed the
                  bonnet on her head, made a courtesy to the rocking-chair, stopped herself in a
                  schottische around the centre-table, because it was Sunday, said "Good morning,
                  ma'am," to the lady in the mirror, donned her mantle, walked into St. Paul's
                  church alone, fully convinced that her hat was the prettiest hat—the most
                  bewitching hat in that infernal Gehenna—the city of Gotham. It was the Sunday
                  after Christmas, and she sat in the church and looked at the Christmas lights and
                  Christmas garlands, and she listened to the Christmas sermon on the blessings of
                  social life and home. The preacher informed her that God had said that it was not
                  good for man to be alone; Mag knew it, and thought about a woman being
                  alone—wondered if it was not considered decidedly bad, "in a world like this,"
                  yet, nevertheless, she intended to go alone the next day to the Dusseldorf
                  Gallery, and look at the Greek slave; it would be such a delight, after having
                  seen the black slaves of the South, and the white slaves of New York, to look at a
                  marble slave that she was convinced did not possess so useless an article as an
                  aching heart.</p>
               <p>And when she had seen it, she proceeded to New Britain, on her way to Glenlyn and
                  May Burton.</p>
               <p>She found Judge Ely in a state of distracting disappointment on account of his
                  lady's misbehaviour.</p>
               <p>"To think, Mag, that Min should serve me so! It is a boy again! And I had got my
                  heart <emph>sot</emph> on a girl!"</p>
               <p>Mag kissed her big cousins—especially the judge, for pity's sake—and then she
                  kissed her little boy cousins, especially Charlie, for his namesake—the oldest one
                  was named with that beautiful name; and then she proceeded to Glenlyn.</p>
               <p>Aunt Lina was in cheerful spirits, considering her recent bereavement. Some lines
                  of care were smoothed away, and a hopeful resignation had taken their place.
                  Business affairs on the farm were looking up, under Aunt Lina's management; and
                  little Harry had grown good and handsome<pb n="420-421" xml:id="VAC6426-00000212"
                  /> some, and Mag kissed him and called him her brother, and he reciprocated.</p>
               <p>"I have some news for you, Mag," said Aunt Lina. "Would you believe it, Master
                  Socrates has been converted and joined the church, and turned preacher; his wife
                  has got to be the nicest looking lady in all the land, and the children are so
                  good and happy; it is the best thing he could possibly have done, for you can't
                  think how it has improved him. He has gone to keeping school again—has got some
                  new clothes—looks like himself—labors for the salvation of sinners every Sunday,
                  and there is no telling what will become of him."</p>
               <p>"Nor of a great many others," replied Mag.</p>
               <p>She reached May Burton at last.</p>
               <p>Sweet, pure, May Burton! She was surely going home. Her eye lighted up with a
                  smile of unearthly beauty, as Mag came to her, and a gush of unearthly gladness
                  swept through Mag's soul.</p>
               <p>"I was sure I should see you before I went," said May; "I have prayed for it,
                  night and day. I knew God would answer my prayer! It brings heaven here, to see
                  you. Have you no message to send by me to that unseen heaven?"</p>
               <p>"You do believe God answers prayer, my darling?" said Mag, as she pillowed the
                  head upon her heart, and wound her arms around her. Mag's throat was swelling with
                  a tearless sob, which she swallowed, as usual, with a smile.</p>
               <p>"Believe it? I know it. Never, never, never doubt God again, Maggy Barclay! God
                  has answered my prayers. If ever you have uttered one prayer in faith, be sure God
                  will answer it."</p>
               <p>"If the prayer was uttered years ago?"</p>
               <p>"God will answer it yet! Never doubt him again! I wanted to see you to tell you
                  that, before I went home."</p>
               <p>And Mag repeated the line from Dr. Judson.</p>
               <p>"I never prayed earnestly and sincerely for anything, but that at some time, in
                  some way, probably the last that I should ever have devised, the prayer was
                  answered."</p>
               <p>"You will certainly know it yet, Mag. There is a God. He is the Our Father, and
                  all things are working together for good to us, when we love him."</p>
               <p>Day by day, now, Mag watched by the bedside—day by day the pure life ebbed away,
                  and Mag looked into the dark eyes and watched their flickering light, till one
                  night, as the sun was setting, the spirit prepared for its departure. Father, and
                  mother, and friends were by the bedside; Mag was there, not sorrowful, but glad
                  with a great hope—a great inspiration. May Burton's life was all spirit now, and
                  Mag Barclay's spirit was all life; Mag, too, was going home at last—wayward,
                  reckless as she had been, sacrilegious in her mockery of man and God, she was
                  going home at last. May was leading her into the land of the great Hereafter—"into
                  the Silent Land."</p>
               <p>"Put your arms around me once more, my darling!" whispered May Burton, for the
                  last time.</p>
               <p>And Mag smiled as she kissed her, and whispered back that it was sweet as heaven
                  to be with her.</p>
               <p>"Now sing to me, Mag."</p>
               <p>And Mag sung, sweet and clear, a song of Jesus.</p>
               <p>The light flashed full and bright into those dying eyes.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Maggy Barclay, I hear music in the air, answering your song! I see the
                  angels!"</p>
               <p>"Do you see them? Do you see Frank, May? Oh, do you see my father and mother? But
                  you do not know them. You will know them! When you speak to them, tell them that
                  the little girl they left alone on earth, has tried, oh! so hard, to be brave and
                  strong! Tell them that she longs, with an unutterable longing, to meet them in the
                  Hereafter; longs to be folded in their arms, and know their love, and sob all her
                  wild weariness away. Will you tell them, darling?"</p>
               <p>"I will tell them, Mag, for I know God will permit it."</p>
               <p>"Tell them that their child has loved them always, and has tried to keep herself
                  pure and true, for them and God. Tell Frank everything that is beautiful, May—I
                  know he loves us."</p>
               <p>The smile brightened on May's face, as she lay gazing beyond the setting sun. What
                  vision was dawning on those pure, spiritual eyes? Who may know?</p>
               <p>"I must go now," she murmured. "Kiss me, father—kiss me, mother—kiss me, dear
                  little sisters—kiss me, all."</p>
               <p>She was almost gone.</p>
               <p>"Good bye now. Jesus is waiting. I am going to Jesus. Good bye!"</p>
               <p>She was gone to the unknown land.</p>
               <p>Magdalene Barclay stood by the grave of May Burton, with tearless eyes. Whether
                  her unnatural exaltation of<pb n="422-423" xml:id="VAC6426-00000213"/> spirit was
                  insanity, or inspiration, or faith, the great, good God alone knows. It was well
                  that some spirit sustained or strengthened her then, for her life-work was not yet
                  accomplished. She was to go forth into the world again, and meet the tempter. She
                  had gained large victories, but she was to meet him on another battle-ground. He
                  disputed possession of her heart, and gave up the contest only to renew it with
                  tenfold strength in the vital parts of the soul.</p>
               <p>Mag saw May Burton close her eyes in that last, dreamless slumber; saw her last
                  smile, as they laid her away for the great awakening in the hereafter, and then
                  went on her own way, strengthened, to accomplish the work whereto God had sent
                  her.</p>
               <p>And now she must attend to her book. Her first business was to test its merits.
                  Dr. Barker, its guardian, must see it. But Dr. Barker, she found, had just gone
                  West for an indefinite time, and Mag must find other resources. She thought over
                  every human being, of her acquaintance, whose criticism would avail her. She did
                  not dare trouble Hudson Ely. And Alec Ross?</p>
               <p>It was against her principles to have dealings that could be avoided, with a man
                  who had once played the traitor. She remembered now but one human being who she
                  thought could aid her; not to a stranger would she again go for aid; her first
                  adventure should be a warning for all eternity. But friends and foes are guided by
                  the same motives of action in this world; there is good and evil both, in every
                  heart. There was good in Alec Ross, and evil in Charles Moore, and evil, too, in
                  Mag's imperfect, human heart.</p>
               <p>Rev. Mr. B———, of Boston, had once taken the fancy to patronize her, as he saw her
                  on a school-examination at Glenlyn. He was an author, acquainted with the literary
                  world. To him she would go.</p>
               <p>To Boston she went; sent a message to the Rev. gentleman, to meet, at the Revere
                  House, the pupil he had once patronized. And he came. It had been years since she
                  had seen him, and she would not at first unfold all of her book project; she
                  wanted to form an opinion of the man; also he might judge of her development. She
                  only half fancied his style of thought. At last she introduced her book, with an
                  apology.</p>
               <p>"He had always expected the world would hear from her. Now, with her knowledge of
                  southern life, she had it in her power to do a vast deal of good in writing
                  against the damnable institution of slavery. He would gladly be the patron of a
                  work from her pen, against that accursed evil."</p>
               <p>Mag "was afraid her sentiments might be considered by him as rather too
                  conservative. If she represented southern life at all, she should represent it
                  exactly as she found it."</p>
               <p>"Yes, and she had found it the most damnable, God-forgotten, hell-deserving curse,
                  that Satan had ever succeeded in bringing upon earth. There was no language strong
                  enough to pour out anathemas upon the hell-born, abominable, accursed thing."</p>
               <p>Mag laughed—saucy thing—but she could not help it; he seemed to spit out those
                  adjectives of cursing, as though they rolled sweet on his tongue, and he enjoyed
                  the flavor.</p>
               <p>She asked him, "if that might not be what was termed orthodox swearing? What it
                  would do for ministers to use, but not the reprobates, for fear of being
                  considered wicked?"</p>
               <p>And she wondered, too, if those were the tones Christ used in his address to the
                  "Generation of Vipers." She had always fancied them tones of indignant grief, not
                  of hatred. There was passion and anger in this man's tones; and, as we have said,
                  Mag looked on all licensed passion with unconcealed contempt.</p>
               <p>"If I had heard a 'southern fire-eater' use those phrases, sir, I should say to
                  him that I did not consider them sufficiently elegant for parlor use, or for
                  ladies' ears; however, they give one an idea of wealth of language; ideas seem to
                  flow so fast, they cannot be spouted forth decently and in order. But, to change
                  the subject, sir, can you tell me whether the statue of Beatrice Cenci is still in
                  Boston?"</p>
               <p>And Mag exerted herself to talk of art, and oratory, and music, and everything but
                  her book, for now she would, by no means, permit it to this man. They took a long
                  ride to Cambridge and Mount Auburn, rode through the cemetery, and recited the
                  poets, and Mag again wished herself safely in heaven, while she was looking at
                  those beautiful monuments among the trees, and wished she could drive on till she
                  reached the unknown, for she saw now that her book, written with so many prayers,
                  must risk itself among strange<pb n="424-425" xml:id="VAC6426-00000214"/>
                  publishers for criticism—poor thing—and it was not yet finished. Home to Glenlyn
                  she must go, and work day and night to finish the thing, before she returned to
                  Alabama, and let it try its luck in New York on the way back, to be bridesmaid at
                  Mack Walter's wedding. It was Alice, after all.</p>
               <p>She thought of all these things while talking with her abolition friend, on the
                  observatory at Mount Auburn. At last, she bade him a good bye, thanking him for
                  showing her the lions of Boston. But she would not leave Boston then; not after
                  she had been over the State House, and the Common, and to the Bunker Hill
                  monument, and to the Navy Yard, and on board of a man-of-war in the harbor; she
                  would not leave Boston till she took a solitary promenade past No. 12 State
                  street, to see if she could not catch a glimpse of the editor of the "Boston
                  Journal." She had an overwhelming curiosity to know whether he wore
                  spectacles.</p>
               <p>Mag worked herself fairly insane on her book. Morning, noon and night she let her
                  brain run wild, and her nerves also. She finished it at last, and started alone
                  again, as she came, on her travels homeward to Alabama. She grew a little
                  faint-hearted, in spite of herself, at that Babel of New York; for she was
                  desperately tired of that hard brainwork, and she was at times famishing again for
                  Frank, and May and Charlie. But she had poured out her life in prayers on the
                  book—it was to be the test of God after all, and her courage and strength must not
                  fail her now, for now or never was the time for action. She had come to the
                  Rubicon.</p>
               <p>The carriage stopped at the —— House—that quiet, aristocratic hotel by ——— Park.
                  She avoided the — ——; she had been there—it was no place for a lady alone. The
                  clerk of the establishment met her at the carriage, as if she had been a
                  millionaire. Mag concluded that there must be something decidedly more distingué
                  in her appearance than in her purse, or the gentlemanly fellow would not be so
                  deferential. She graciously accepted his consideration, booked herself for room
                  No.—, a pleasant, private parlor on the first floor. She walked into the public
                  sitting-room that fronts Union Square, and found herself face to face with Charles
                  Atherton Moore!</p>
               <p>Mag had learned to keep her face under perfect control; the blood fled from it,
                  but not a muscle quivered; her senses were well trained now—they had been through
                  a stern ordeal since last she had trembled before him. Her frame quivered slightly
                  with emotion as she placed her hand in his. Not yet was her prayer for him
                  answered. She met him frankly and honestly.</p>
               <p>"God knows I am glad to see you, Charles Moore! You have been a strange rover. I
                  am glad you are going home at last."</p>
               <p>Those eyes were upon her again.</p>
               <p>"I have wandered beyond your wildest dreams, Magdalene Barclay, and you are a wild
                  dreamer. I told you I was going on the road to destruction, because you promised
                  to follow me there. I have tried the path thoroughly, Mag—looked for Ruin, have
                  not found it utterly, but now I have found you and Ruin together."</p>
               <p>At words like these, Mag's powers came in play. She became perfectly
                  self-possessed. It was not the Charles Moore of her dreams.</p>
               <p>"Come to my room, No. 60, in a half hour, Charles Moore, I will talk with you
                  there."</p>
               <p>In a half hour she had made her toilet to receive him. She went to meet him, as he
                  sent his card—gave him her hand as a princess might have done to a favored
                  subject, and they entered the parlor together.</p>
               <p>There was a proud, firm compression of those curved lips, and a steel-look in the
                  blue eyes at the gracious reception of the princess Mag.</p>
               <p>"I told you long ago, Mag, that I should never again make a proposal of honorable
                  love to you. I gave you a gem once, that you trampled upon ruthlessly. I have
                  grown ruthless since. You have sown the wind, you must reap the whirlwind."</p>
               <p>His breath was upon her cheek, fragrant with wine. While she had been preparing to
                  receive him, he had prepared to receive her. He threw his strong arms around her,
                  drew her down to him upon the sofa—he pinioned her there—he devoured her lips with
                  passionate kisses, murmuring, while she strove madly away from him, in the serpent
                  tones, whose music might have beguiled Eve, "No, you cannot escape me now,
                  Magdalene Barclay! God intended us for each other once, but you have destroyed
                  yourself! I will not chide you now, for you are mine, all mine."</p>
               <p>Mag could not free herself from those powerful arms.<pb n="426-427"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000215"/> Her presence of mind did not forsake her then. She
                  was perfectly calm. Her spirit rose free and daring. Not even then did she fear
                  him.</p>
               <p>"Release me, sir," she said, in low and emphatic tones, "or your life will be the
                  forfeit!"</p>
               <p>"You would never kill me, Mag. You could not do it!"</p>
               <p>"God knows I would do it!"</p>
               <p>But his arms pinioned her in a grasp of iron.</p>
               <p>"Please, Charlie!" said she, cooing softly in her most pleading tones, "please,
                  Charlie, let me go for one little moment. Only see how you have deranged my hair.
                  Please let me go for one instant."</p>
               <p>He slowly and doubtfully released her. She bounded from his arms and rang the
                  bell—walked to the mirror to arrange her dishevelled tresses. Charles Moore
                  followed her, his arms were around her again, but she was upon her feet now, and
                  forced him from her; she threw him back with her proud strength, and lifted a
                  daring glance to his. There was passionate scorn in her words, low and calm as
                  they rung from the curl of those lips.</p>
               <p>"God knows I do not fear you, Charles Atherton Moore! And oh, I have such infinite
                  compassion for you! I pity you as the Man-God we used to talk about pitied the
                  Magdalene! Since you and I parted years ago, I have believed in God. If I doubt
                  him utterly again, I will go to that world where Frank Ross has gone. If it be
                  annihilation itself, that will be glorious in comparison with this life on earth,
                  where evil reigns supreme."</p>
               <p>The servant entered who answered the bell.</p>
               <p>"I had much to say to you, but it is useless now, you must go."</p>
               <p>She turned to the servant. "Show the gentleman to the public parlor."</p>
               <p>Charles Moore did not dare disobey the look of her eye. He walked out, Mag locked
                  the door after him, and then her nerves gave way. She threw herself upon the floor
                  with a long shudder. "'Et tu Brute.' Had it come to this!" Again and again she
                  shuddered—sick—sick—sick—brain, heart, and soul sick! "Was this mockery an answer
                  to the thousand earnest prayers of her bleeding life? Her prayers—her work for
                  years, all mockery! life itself all mockery! heaven a mockery!"</p>
               <p>Her brain had been overtasked in its labor to finish the book. She had worked on
                  it night and day, with her finger on her pulse, to know how much fever the busy
                  brain could bear, and now the one thing too much had come—it was overtasked at
                  last, and gave way under the terrible rush of thought.</p>
               <p>"God had done it!" she said again and again. "God had done it, if there was a God!
                  He had fooled her again, in answer to the thousand, thousand bitter prayers of her
                  long years of loveless solitude! While she had been a stranger in a strange land,
                  how she had yearned and thirsted for human love and sympathy! How she had longed
                  for death, but would not take her life in cowardly madness, because, perchance,
                  there was a God! How she had entreated the Unknown God to reveal himself in answer
                  to prayer, and permit her to know that he existed. She had thrown her all upon
                  this venture, faith, love, hope—hope for this world—hope for everlasting life! She
                  had thrown all upon the venture, and lost! All was lost! God had promised
                  faithfully to direct her in all her prayers! He had directed her hither to this!
                  The Bible and Bushnell's "Supernatural" had led her to test God. Her book—her work
                  for years—had been, thus far, only a mockery! God had brought Charles Moore a
                  devil to mock her! Should she not mock and defy the God who had done it? Life was
                  an unmitigated curse; she would not for another day trouble herself with the
                  unendurable thing! She had reached the bottom of the abyss at last! There could be
                  no lower hell! What was life, or earth, or heaven to her, since Charles Moore had
                  turned Arch-Demon? Frank was gone—May Burton was gone—she was entirely alone upon
                  the earth now. No one could miss her, or care when she threw her worthless life
                  away! The prince of the pit had won her heart. Perdition with him was sweeter than
                  heaven without him! Not another moment's bliss could she find upon earth, and now
                  she was going to the Great Unknown—now she would go to the long, dreamless
                  slumber!"</p>
               <p>Her senses forsook her entirely; she sank into blissful unconsciousness; the
                  spirit was indeed overwrought; the brain, so busy in its desperate life-work and
                  struggle, had gone insane at last; the long excitement of years had reached its
                  crisis. Yes, she had reached the bottomless at last. There were no lower depths
                  for her. Tempted beyond refuge!</p>
               <p>At last she awoke from unconsciousness; staggered to her feet, went to her trunk,
                  took out her pistol, seated herself<pb n="428-429" xml:id="VAC6426-00000216"/>
                  self upon the sofa as she examined it, pressed down the balls with trembling
                  fingers. Her nerves shook strangely; they were not controlled by will. She
                  condescended to no prayers now—they were worse than useless—there was no God.
                  Twice her prayers had led her to the mouth of the pit; now she would enter it of
                  her own free will!</p>
               <p>She smiled to herself, a strange, sad smile, as thought worked on. She wondered
                  what a conscience meant; it was a curious piece of mechanism hung in the human
                  frame; it had influenced her for twenty years; led her over a wild, rough path, a
                  path that she should travel never again!—never more! To the grave she should go,
                  without tasting once on earth the love of father or mother, or home. The pistol
                  might do its work. She smiled again; her fingers pressed upon the trigger
                  caressingly. She turned faint again, and stretched herself exhausted upon the
                  sofa.</p>
               <p>All night long she lay there; the fever mounted to her brain, burned in her veins;
                  the pistol dropped upon the floor, forgotten. Her brow and temples were hot, and
                  the fingers wandered over them, but could not cool them, for they were burning,
                  too. Footsteps tortured her; her heart throbbed with a beat that was torture too.
                  She forgot everything in the wild torture of thought. Charles Moore had dishonored
                  his own soul; she would not live to see that degradation. It tortured her in
                  fever. He had degraded his soul.</p>
               <p>The long night passed. Footsteps went by her door. At last, there came a knock,
                  once—twice—thrice repeated. It recalled her senses; she staggered up and opened
                  the door. It was a servant. He brought a note; but she was giddy again, and threw
                  herself upon the couch before she could read it. The servant picked up the pistol,
                  and laid it on the centre-table.</p>

               <p>"Tell the gentleman I cannot see him."</p>
               <p>The servant left her. In a few moments there came another knock—and another—and
                  another. She gave no response. The door opened, and Charles Moore entered.</p>
               <p>"You must see me! You must forgive me, Magdalene!"</p>
               <p>He was kneeling by her side now, and she was smiling upon him with a strange,
                  bright smile; the look in her dark eyes was more than radiance; it was
                  insanity!</p>
               <p>"I know now it was all a lie they told us about 'Our Father in heaven;' and I am
                  so tired! I must go to sleep, only I can't sleep. I shall never dream any more,
                  dreams of the wild dreamer; there is no dreaming there in the ruins. We will be
                  baptized together; the waters will rock us again in the little boat; it will be so
                  cooling to go down in the water, with the white lilies, together—so very
                  beautiful—you and I together, Charlie! Are you not Charlie? And you can call me
                  'darling' again; and I will show you all the ruin you have been searching for so
                  long. Put the water cool and fresh upon my heart, for I love you dearly as the
                  Christ loves sinners. I must die now! We are great sinners, Charlie; you and I are
                  great sinners, but love is the atonement. Did you not say you loved me once in
                  Glenlyn, thousands of years ago, and we dreamed of angels, with whom love is never
                  a sin—never, never, never a sin; and we are great sinners, yet we love the
                  angels."</p>
               <p>Charles Atherton Moore trembled over the ruin he had wrought. If he had searched
                  the world for it, he had found it at last. His lips were tremulous with a great
                  and solemn fear, as he murmured:</p>
               <p>"I do love you, better than my own life; better than my own soul! I love you for
                  your stainless purity! I would kill myself a thousand times, rather than harm
                  you!"</p>
               <p>Tears were raining from his eyes upon the fevered brow; they were not unmanly
                  tears. He bathed the brow and hot fingers with water; rang the bell, and sent the
                  servant in all haste for a physician.</p>
               <p>It was brain fever, Dr. H——— said; the brain had probably been over-wrought, and
                  some sudden excitement had brought the fever to a crisis. The patient would need
                  watchful nursing.</p>
               <p>And she received it.</p>
               <p>There were intervals when her senses seemed returning.</p>
               <p>"Will you not give me the right to nurse you now, Maggy?" he asked, in one of
                  these intervals. "You wronged me years ago in denying me that right. We have
                  wronged each other. Shall we not forgive each other, and right those terrible
                  wrongs?"</p>
               <pb n="430-431" xml:id="VAC6426-00000217"/>
               <p>"Do with me as you will. God is deciding for us, Charlie."</p>
               <p>"You will be mine—all mine, in this sickness and sorrow?"</p>
               <p>"All yours; I dare not say otherwise. God is doing it."</p>
               <p>Dr. H——— offered his services in this emergency. A marriage license was procured,
                  and when the excitement would not injure the patient, Mag listened to the solemn
                  service.</p>
               <p>"Wilt thou take this man to be thy wedded husband?"</p>
               <p>The response was sweet and clear: "I will."</p>
               <p>It brought music, forgiveness, and blessing.</p>
               <p>All that love could do, was done for Magdalene Barclay Moore. With love for
                  medicine, the equilibrium was at last restored to her over-wrought brain and
                  shattered nerves.</p>
               <p>"Dr. H——— says that I may take you back to Glenlyn soon, ma belle," said Charlie
                  to her, on the sixth day. "You are to keep very quiet and very happy, while I
                  write to Uncle Ross to meet us at the depot. I shall tell him just how naughty you
                  have been, and let him prepare the punishment."</p>
               <p>"And please, Charlie, write to Colonel Walter, and tell him what a funny excuse I
                  have found for leaving him."</p>
               <p>"And I will write also to Colonel Moore and lady, of Huntsville, that their
                  wandering boy is coming home again, and is to bring them as a daughter the
                  wayward, coquettish little New England girl, that sent him for years a rover, and
                  has almost been his ruin. She is going to redeem him now."</p>
               <p>"Will they love her, Charlie?"</p>
               <p>"She will steal their hearts whether they wish it or not. They must love her, or I
                  shall disown them."</p>
               <p>"And I am to have father and mother! I am to have a sister Lizzy and brother Guy,
                  and home and friends! Oh, Charlie, I am sure it is impossible! All for me?"</p>
               <p>"And I shall write to Guy and Lizzy that we are coming there. Shall we wait and go
                  to Newport and Nahant first, this summer, for your health, or home first?"</p>
               <p>"It is all a dream, Charlie. I want to sail on the little lake at Glenlyn and talk
                  to you about Frank and May; and we must see Hudson and Min Ely. Oh, two such
                  famous boys as they have, Charlie! You would never believe it! And, Charlie, I saw
                  Lizzy's baby laid in the grave; it was named for you! And Guy is such a grand
                  fellow! How he does love you! And how much we have to talk about!"</p>
               <p>"Hush, hush, chatterbox! You will never get well if you talk so fast. Why, Mag,
                  the words come pouring out in such profusion, there is no order to them. What a
                  tongue you have, and what lips! But the doctor has forbid your talking; you must
                  go to sleep now."</p>
               <p>"I am so happy, I can't think of sleep."</p>
               <p>"Then you can't go to Glenlyn next week. Seriously, Mag, you must sleep."</p>
               <p>"How can I, Charlie, when I can't?"</p>
               <p>"You are one willful, naughty girl."</p>
               <p>Charlie put the willful head near his heart, closed the willful eyes; and large
                  tears stole from under those long lashes, and she sobbed herself to sleep at last,
                  exhausted with her fullness of content.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>XXX. HOME AT LAST.</head>
               <p>IN a few days, the nurse whom Dr. H——— had sent, permitted Mag to be dressed.
                  Charlie received her with a grateful joy, to which she responded.</p>
               <p>"I must thank God now for it all! My heart has been running over with prayers
                  continually, but now I must tell the great, good God how I love him. It is so easy
                  to believe in him and trust him when we are happy; but you told me that, years
                  ago, in Glenlyn. May I tell God that I love him now, Charlie?"</p>
               <p>"You are a strange child, Mag."</p>
               <p>"But the 'Our Father' is all the father I have ever known—a better God to me than
                  the distant, Mighty God of whom we once talked. He is near us; he folds us in his
                  arms when we trust him, and listens in love to our wildest sorrow and gladdest
                  joy. It was wrong for me to doubt him as I did when you came to me. May I tell him
                  so?"</p>
               <p>"Tell him all you please. If he loves you as I do he will pardon you though
                  everything is wrong."</p>
               <p>"But it can't be wrong. If God is true at all, he is wholly<pb n="432"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000218"/> true. If God is anything to us, he is and ought to
                  be everything to us—our father, lover and friend. May I tell him how you and I
                  have come home together at last, and love him, Charlie? We love him because he
                  loves us, and commands us to love each other as our own souls. Shall I tell him?
                  It will be very beautiful!"</p>
               <p>"Do you love God, because I love you, Mag?"</p>
               <p>"When there were a thousand tempters around me, in my worse than solitude—when I
                  was alone among those whom I thought to be human demons—and entirely unprotected,
                  if there was no God, I thought of the magnanimous and honorable love you had shed
                  upon me in blessing, then your image towered like an angel beyond all the selfish,
                  passion-bound slaves around me, and I went to the unknown God, in humility, and
                  thanked him that I had once known you. I promised him that if he would restore you
                  to me, but for one day, I would be satisfied. I would know that I had tasted the
                  deepest bliss life had to give, and I would die gratefully, saying, as Jacob said
                  when Joseph was restored, 'It is enough!' God has permitted me to be with you now
                  many days, and I must thank him, for I feel very unworthy of it all. I do not
                  realize this new life. I tremble, fearing it is but a dream from which I shall
                  soon awaken. I have been a stranger and a rover so long—feeling forever that
                  happiness unshared was not happiness—that I shudder, fearing I must leave you,
                  even yet, and I must ask our Father to keep us both."</p>
               <p>"You shall ask him for me, Mag."</p>
               <p>And Mag knelt down then, and thanked God because he had brought them home to him.
                  She asked him in all humility, for Christ's sake, to preserve the hearts trembling
                  with the very fullness of the great happiness of earth. She asked him to fill them
                  with his Holy Spirit, the Paraclete, and make them meek, and lowly, and loving,
                  and pure. She asked him to teach them to love and adore him supremely, and to make
                  them so lovely in his eyes that he would delight in his children.</p>
               <p>"Charlie and Mag went to Glenlyn. Uncle Ross met them.</p>
               <p>"You have done it at last, Mag," he said.</p>
               <p>"Charlie did it, uncle! I never should have done so rash a thing in my sane
                  senses."</p>
               <p>"H'm! The most sensible thing you ever performed in your life. You have been a
                  crazy child all your days. I<pb n="433" xml:id="VAC6426-00000219"/> hope Charlie
                  will keep you in close quarters now, till you behave yourself."</p>
               <p>"On the whole, uncle," said Mag, "I've concluded that the marriage couldn't have
                  been legal. I know I was not in my senses. Can't something be done about it now?
                  Charlie has deceived me—captured me under false pretences. I thought he was a
                  soldier and belonged to the United States army; and now it turns out he is a
                  coward, has deserted the army; and I am in heart-rending tribulation. Don't you
                  think that ceremony illegal?"</p>
               <p>"We will have it performed over again some night next week, with all the honors. I
                  myself will see that the knot is fastened so firmly that there will not be the
                  slightest possibility of your slipping it."</p>
               <p>"But how am I to join the army, uncle? Charlie will be court-martialed the instant
                  he reports himself. His furlough was only for six months, and he has been gone for
                  years. I am broken-hearted over it all."</p>
               <p>"If you are really anxious, Mag, I can get up a shipwreck to account for the
                  desertion," said Charlie. "Father was a soldier himself, you know, and has
                  influence with the government, especially in the war department, and I can yet
                  take you to join the army in Texas. How will you enjoy frontier life? If you
                  cannot submit to hardships, I shall be obliged to leave you here."</p>
               <p>"Do you think you'll be able to find anything to eat on the frontiers? Eating is a
                  very bad habit, of which I was never able to break myself, though I tried
                  excessively when I was on the frontiers. Please, Charlie, don't starve me."</p>
               <p>"I think most of the people in San Antonio live by eating, Mag, and I'll try my
                  best to feed you."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Charlie. How much you relieve my fears!"</p>
               <p>Mag was poring over a book one day—"The Eclipse of Faith"—her eyes eclipsed with
                  tears at the death of Harrington, in the last pages, when Charlie found her.</p>
               <p>"And about that book of yours, Mag?" said he. "You have spent so many prayers over
                  it, and poured out your heart and life upon it—of course you intend to publish it
                  now."</p>
               <p>"There is no occasion to publish it now, Charlie. I have found my position without
                  it."</p>
               <p>"That remark is not like yourself, Mag."</p>
               <pb n="434-435" xml:id="VAC6426-00000220"/>
               <p>"Well, I don't think my opinions of life were fully formed when I wrote. I was
                  young—thought undeveloped. In the next two years, if mind and thought expand as
                  God intended they should, I shall have outgrown the book of my girlhood, and
                  repudiated it. What is truth to a girl of eighteen, is seldom truth to a woman who
                  has tested life."</p>
               <p>"You said you were testing God, audacious girl. Dare you leave your work
                  unfinished, having persecuted him with your prayers over it for years? Dare you do
                  less than your best for it?"</p>
               <p>"It is a crucifixion to my pride to be brought before the public—to permit every
                  bantling of a critic to display his powers, by spending his opinions on my
                  opinions. What I wrote, was truth to me when I wrote it. Now it is precious to me
                  as truth. Many would condemn it, because to very few has experience taught such
                  truth. Nothing but desperation ever drove me to write it. It is a penniless
                  woman's last resort to gain a standing-place in the world—her only hope for safety
                  and seclusion, from a daily public life, in the sanctuary of a home. I was sick of
                  the very danger of my position. With my habits of thought, it was unsafe to be a
                  stranger, a teacher and a woman—my temperament was against me also, for when I
                  doubted God, in orphanage, and went to his ministers for comfort, they called me
                  that horror of horrors, a female skeptic. A woman's name—the slightest breath can
                  stain it, and there is no redemption. In desperation, as a last resort, I wrote a
                  book, and wrote what life had taught me, but I do not wish to be brought before
                  the world, by publishing it, now that the necessity is over."</p>
               <p>"But the answer to the prayer of faith? You have prayed over your pages for
                  months—you wish to know for yourself whether the Supernatural comes to the aid of
                  Nature, as Bushnell teaches. Do you believe in miraculous answers to prayer with
                  him?"</p>
               <p>"I believe that God makes us work out the answers to our own prayers. 'Faith
                  without works is dead.' God does not permit man for one instant to throw aside his
                  own energy. Labor develops the faculties for that higher life in the hereafter;
                  and God intends to force us to the highest development, by teaching us to answer
                  our own prayers. If God answered prayer otherwise, men would lose energy..... My
                  book is written—the writing of it was an education to me; even if an utter
                  failure, I have a clean conscience. I have done with my might what my hands found
                  to do—have used to the best of my abilities the talents committed to my care. If
                  the book perish, let it perish, it has developed my faculties. I take a higher
                  stand-point of thought than if it had never been undertaken—am worthier of your
                  regard, and God's approbation. Let the book perish. I have lived in it up to a
                  nobler life."</p>
               <p>"You have educated your energies..... What is to become of them now?.... Action is
                  your life..... Rest will be certain death to one who has cultivated your restless
                  habits of action."</p>
               <p>"You and I ought to do some good in the world—it is demanded of you, Charles
                  Atherton Moore. You have no right to permit your royal nature to live any longer
                  in selfish luxury. It must do a noble life-work now."</p>
               <p>"You would make your fortune, Mag, by giving public lectures."</p>
               <p>"I intended to try it, if my book proved a failure. It would be a crucifixion of
                  my womanly nature, but a last resort..... I could do it, when the last friend, who
                  could mourn over my destruction, was gone..... No one on earth to understand
                  me..... I could afford to put on a mask, take my shame upon me, and see what the
                  world could give me—for, having lost all, I could lose nothing more."</p>
               <p>"Goethe says, 'The longer I live, the more certain I am that the great difference
                  between men, the great and insignificant, is energy—invincible determination—an
                  honest purpose once fixed—and then victory. That quality will do anything that can
                  be done in the world, and no opportunity, no circumstances will make a creature a
                  man without it.'"</p>
               <p>"I believed it ..... and if I did not, my case was not less desperate .....
                  nothing more for me to lose..... I intended to preach, however, that woman's
                  province was home—that she had better go to her grave than ever step out of its
                  shelter. I intended to advise all mothers to take their little daughters to heaven
                  with them, rather than leave them alone in a world like this. I was going to
                  approve the customs of the Chinese, of killing their female children, and of the
                  Hindoos, of burning their widows."</p>
               <p>"Your lectures would have been popular, for you would have made them eloquent,
                  pathetic, pious and witty."</p>

               <p>"There are two worlds in America, one of which is ruled by the 'Almighty Dollar,'
                  and one in which intellect is power. Oh, how those do worship the former who
                  cannot enter the latter! A friendless woman has no hope to win a position in
                  either world, but by writing books—and alas, the only books her intellect,
                  cultivation and experience permit her to write, are romances. The world is flooded
                  with romances written by women. Some have written in desperation, as I wrote,
                  others wrote because they were endowed with minds that were stagnating for want of
                  action, or growing morbid with thought that was preying upon itself, having no
                  outlet or exercise. You have no idea, Charlie, of the intense pity I have for
                  these idle, restless minds."</p>
               <p>"Yet you are not one of the strong-minded—would not send them before the public to
                  work?"</p>
               <p>"Never! God help them! A woman's province is home—her throne in one human heart,
                  not on the lips of the world!"</p>
               <p>"You are a mass of contradictions!"</p>
               <p>"These strong souls are terribly tempted at times. To you I may say a daring
                  thing, because you will not misunderstand me. Many and many a woman in America has
                  prostituted herself by a legal marriage—given her person without her heart, for
                  gold. I can see, by my battle for existence among the false who wore the garb of
                  Christianity, how a friendless woman could be tempted to buy protection at such a
                  terrible price—the gift of a hand without a heart. But what you thought of, in New
                  York, I believe to be as holy in God's eyes, for we loved each other. It would
                  have been a horrible sin, one that would have brought its own retribution—a pure
                  nature would have found in it insanity and death! God permits sin to work out its
                  own curse at times."</p>
               <p>"Go on, Mag; a woman has very little knowledge of the strange loves of a man's
                  experience. Well for them that they have not! They are Shielded from knowledge
                  that would stain the purity which alone makes their natures lovely."</p>
               <p>"But, for that very reason, a lady writer cannot represent life as it really is.
                  Most of their romances represent life falsely. What life has taught must be
                  written, and few women have large experiences."</p>
               <p>"Lola Montez is a woman of large experiences."</p>
               <p>"She paid a pearl of price for them! 'Thou art inexcusable cusable, O man, that
                  judgest another!' I never dared condemn Lola Montez. She was terribly tempted. It
                  was a sorrowful thing that she yielded to temptation. She deceived something noble
                  in her nature when she permitted herself to do evil, that good might come to
                  Bavaria. God shall judge her. I was once tempted to the crime of suicide, but you
                  saved me!"</p>
               <p>"God saved you, Mag, and you saved me. We should have found ruin and death
                  together!"</p>
               <p>"Do you know what became of my pistol, Charlie? The last I remember of it, I laid
                  it on the centre-table."</p>
               <p>"I took possession of it, supposing it was intended for me. I think I deserved it.
                  But now for your book."</p>
               <p>"Charlie, the book will bring me into the world again, as another one of the race
                  of female novelists—poor souls!"</p>
               <p>"You can publish anonymously. You can send your child an orphan into the world, to
                  perish, if it has not strength enough to save itself."</p>
               <p>"Poor, unprotected thing! And laugh at it myself, when the critics annihilate it?
                  It seems almost cruel."</p>
               <p>"In these days, a book witten by Gabriel or Ithuriel could not be a success on
                  earth, without literary friends to notice and puff it. Faith cannot save it
                  without that kind of work. I can help you answer your own prayers for its success,
                  by inducing the faithful to work for it. You will allow me to do that, so that you
                  may know, for certain, whether all your prayers, and faith, and labor have been in
                  vain."</p>
               <p>"Well, Charlie, put pictures in the book—I like pictures."</p>
               <p>"You do, you witch! And will you go to Europe with me, when it is all over?"</p>
               <p>"I would rather go home."</p>
               <p>"Your home is wherever I am. Shall we go to Asia, too?"</p>
               <p>"Once you promised to take me to Congress. I want to go to Congress. I intend to
                  vote for Douglas, too. I like him. He is a man. He has made some false steps, but
                  because he knows how to profit by defeat, I like him. You certainly must go to
                  Congress, Charlie!" Mag could not get over the habit of dealing in badinage.</p>
               <p>"I'll do anything reasonable for you, Mag. But I've concluded to take you into the
                  army, and soldiers can't be<pb n="438-439" xml:id="VAC6426-00000222"/>
                  Congressmen, till they have fought and bled for their country! You are getting
                  exorbitant in your requirements."</p>
               <p>"I am getting crazy to see Lizzy and Guy. Are not you?"</p>
               <p>"I am not of the insane order, you know, Mag. It is necessary that one member of
                  the family should be cool and prudent, to preserve equilibrium. There must be a
                  balancing power."</p>
               <p>"I am glad that discretion and prudence are your forte. You know I pride myself on
                  my indiscretion. I can take large license now."</p>
               <p>"I have no doubt you will try your power. When you try it against me, I shall
                  exert mine, and I won, I believe, in that last trial."</p>
               <p>"It is the great charm of life, that you are my superior."</p>
               <p>"Thank you. It was difficult to find your superior, was it not, Mag? You played
                  your part admirably with me, and won the victory when you thought yourself
                  defeated, as ladies often do."</p>
               <p>A few evenings after this, all the élite of Glenlyn were assembled at the Ross
                  mansion, to do the honors! Josie Newton was there, with all her blushing glories
                  thick upon her. Aunt Lina was there, and declared that she was proud of Mag at
                  last. Alec Ross was there, and by his side a pure, sunny-eyed girl, who looked up
                  to him with a woman's reverence. To him the charm of her nature was its fresh,
                  bright purity. Like many another Puritan girl, bred in the sanctuary of New
                  England hills, her wildest dreams had no conception of the strange paths in which
                  passion had led the man she worshipped. She thought him too noble to be influenced
                  by temptation. She was destined to fulfill woman's mission; to purify by her
                  gentleness, goodness, and truth, the heart, of whose stains she remained forever
                  unconscious.</p>
               <p>Neither Frank Ross nor May Burton were there.</p>
               <p>Frank's father and his mother looked for him and missed him. A sadness trembled on
                  his mother's lip, and settled on his father's brow.</p>
               <p>Mag and Charlie went to them. Charlie said:</p>
               <p>"We could not have loved Frank Ross more dearly, if he had been our own brother.
                  For his sake, let us be your children, Uncle Ross."</p>
               <p>A tear started down Dr. Ross's cheek, and many tears rained on Aunt Emma's heart,
                  as he replied, fervently:</p>
               <p>"God bless you, my dear children."</p>
               <p>Dr. Ross recovered the tone of his spirits during the evening, enough to
                  distinguish himself by a "sentiment," which he gave on the marriage occasion. It
                  was received by the company with all the honors.</p>
               <p>"The union of the North and South. The South, the first-born of mother England,
                  and full of strength, yet, with a disease in its bosom; the South, rich with a
                  proud but generous chivalry, that at times leads it a reckless rover into lands
                  not its own. The North, second-born of her mother, earnest, brave, and noble as
                  her own rugged mountains and lovely valleys. The North has stung the restless
                  pride of the first-born, by tampering with the disease in its veins, till the love
                  was dissolved that once united them, and ruin and desolation threatened their
                  union. In much tribulation, they have found, at last, that only in union is
                  strength; only in family love can be found true prosperity, peace, and happiness.
                  Only in the union of the North and South can the spirit of true freedom find its
                  home. Only when the spirit of love is in that home, can God pour out his
                  blessing.</p>
               <p>"The union of the North and South. With God's blessing, its offspring will be
                  Liberty and Peace."</p>
               <p>Charles Atherton Moore and Magdalene Barclay Moore were soon on their way to
                  Alabama. Alabama—a fitting name: <emph>Here we rest.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Grandfather and Grandmother Barclay gave them a parting blessing, the patriarch
                  leaning upon his staff. Again tears fell from Mag's eyes, for her heart was
                  softening at last. She listened to his words in much sorrow, for she knew she
                  should see his face no more.</p>
               <p>"The Lord bless thee, and keep thee; the Lord make his face shine upon thee, and
                  be gracious unto thee. The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee
                  peace."</p>
               <p>Charles Moore joined the army; but, when on furlough, their home was with Colonel
                  Moore in Huntsville. Their life was not of unalloyed bliss; it is not the lot of
                  any upon earth; well for the earth-born that it is not, or they would forget that
                  they must win another heaven beyond the grave. There were partings that were full
                  of sadness to them; but there were meetings, also, full of bliss. Mag never saw
                     the<pb n="440-441" xml:id="VAC6426-00000223"/> day when she did not need the
                  smile of God. There were daily blessings, for which she was grateful, the love
                  given her for Charlie's sake. She needed God's smile upon it always, to make it
                  perfect, and she did not forget to ask God for that smile. She won an honorable
                  place in the hearts of the household.</p>
               <p>Colonel Moore came to her one day, as she sat listlessly upon the sofa.</p>
               <p>"You seem to be in a pouting mood, my daughter. You may recover yourself by being
                  useful." And to put Mag in the way of being useful, he stretched himself upon the
                  sofa, with his head upon her lap. "Now, while you magnetize my headache, you may
                  tell me what you and Charlie have been quarrelling about. I don't intend to let
                  Charlie impose upon you, he is too much of a tyrant always."</p>
               <p>"He is a terrible fellow, he is so jealous!"</p>
               <p>"This is about my idea of heaven, Mag; to lie on a lounge with a pretty girl's
                  fingers in my hair."</p>
               <p>"You must not mention your ideas of heaven to the over-pious, papa; they will be
                  shocked, and tell you that angels are too busy and in better business, than to
                  spend a priceless eternity in combing hair."</p>
               <p>"I haven't acquired heavenly tastes yet; my ideas are about as earthly as those of
                  the good old lady, who thought she should sit in heaven all day with a clean apron
                  and sing psalms."</p>
               <p>"You must improve your tastes, papa. You shock us by mentioning them."</p>
               <p>"I can't help liking to have pretty fingers play the deuce with my hair!" Mag gave
                  said hair a twist. "Mag! look out for the pulling! And I do love good little girls
                  who have the mischief in them—I can't help it. And I hope they won't get it all
                  taken out of them, before they go to the better land. I should hate it mightily if
                  you were not as big a witch in heaven as you are here!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, papa! How wicked! Charlie is dreadfully jealous of you!"</p>
               <p>"He knows you are a born coquette—the reprobate! You'll be coquetting with me
                  soon; but I'll stand between you and all harm—and do you tell Charlie so. You are
                  too obedient altogether."</p>
               <p>"And I am jealous of mamma, too. Charlie thinks her perfect, and I have done my
                  best to get perfect, and I can't. What can I do about it?"</p>
               <p>"It's a puzzle, isn't it, Mag? You'll never be like mamma surely, or like any one
                  else but yourself. The Ethiopian cannot change his skin, nor the leopard his
                  spots. It is a hopeless case for you. You must try to make the best of it."</p>
               <p>"Do you know I have been trying all my life to pattern after that model of
                  meekness, vanity and submission, Josephine of France, and now I am more like any
                  other pattern in the universe than hers. It is discouraging. Don't you think
                  so?"</p>
               <p>"It is a discouraging world, any way. But I'll help you all I can, if you'll
                  promise not to spoil yourself by being too good."</p>
               <p>"I'll promise."</p>
               <p>"Haven't you found the world a terribly discouraging place?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know," said Mag, growing serious at the thought. "I remember several
                  years of my life that were discouraging. When I left Glenlyn, everybody forgot me;
                  that made me feel my insignificance. Then I went to Mississippi, and found no new
                  friends to fill the vacancy. And worse than that in Marion, I found none but false
                  friends; and that was discouraging, for I thought I was going to the bad, in spite
                  of myself. I wondered some very sublime things over it all. Wondered what I had
                  done, that God should treat me so; wondered if I had been wicked all my life,
                  without knowing it, till I was given up to evil, like the man McCosh tells about,
                  who, having gone on in prosperity, and flourished in wickedness, till he thought
                  he and evil were omnipotent, found suddenly one day that adversity had come. Then
                  his sins, that had supported him, every one turned against him. They came out from
                  all their hiding-places, in the battle-ground of life, and hunted him like
                  sleuth-hounds in full cry, and every cry a curse, till he knew, at last, that the
                  tendency of all sin is to ruin and destruction. I thought that my unconscious sins
                  were carrying me to ruin, or else there was no God. Then the world was
                  discouraging."</p>
               <p>God does not always save the good; many a good man and woman will find no refuge
                  from evil but in the grave."</p>
               <p>"But the tendency of good is to build up. If we cling to the good within us,
                  through all temptations, at last it will strengthen us, and if prosperity does
                  come, all that good within us then comes to crown us with blessings.<pb
                     n="442-443" xml:id="VAC6426-00000224"/> Many and many, for want of energy, or
                  on account of some evil that has descended to them, perhaps from the third and
                  fourth generation, or from the violation of some law of nature, have fainted and
                  died before the day of prosperity came. God works by law; faith works by law. Men
                  cannot transgress the laws of nature, the laws of their physical and moral being,
                  without suffering the consequences of the transgression, and the worst
                  consequences descend in curses upon their children! But it makes me sad to think
                  of these things. I believe I want to cry, papa, and I wish somebody would love
                  me."</p>
               <p>"You are growing so wise, it will be right hard to love you!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, papa is growing cross! And there comes Charlie with the horses, and I am
                  glad, for I don't love cross people. Isn't Grey Eagle a beauty? But my Grey Falcon
                  is the most graceful. I think I prefer Charlie to you after all, and I hope you,
                  papa, will have a great heart-ache for jealousy. I shall coquette with Charlie. I
                  can do it with a perfect ravishment on horse-back."</p>
               <p>"I could swear to that."</p>
               <p>"Don't, sir, if you please. Isn't this riding <foreign xml:lang="FRA">cap a

                  colonel? Good-by, papa. <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Au revoir.</foreign>"</p>
               <p>And Mrs. Charles Atherton Moore tossed a handful of kisses back on her fingers, as
                  Charlie met her. They mounted and rode away.</p>
               <p>Under all this badinage lay a broad, true, pure strength; it was like the bright
                  ocean foam that covers deep, still waters. She loved the Father with an earnest,
                  child-like love—the playfulness of her nature had often been cultivated, to veil
                  from profane eyes the sacred secrets of her being; if she must go to the
                  bottomless she would go smiling—now it rippled into daily life as sunshine. She
                  considered happiness a great duty as well as a great art. It was a great duty to
                  cultivate her nature toward perfection.</p>
               <p>Charles and Magdalene Moore recognized at last the loving Father's hand as having
                  always guided them through mysterious ways. They became members of Christ's Church
                  on earth—devoting themselves to the task of developing to their utmost power all
                  that was divine in humanity. By doing God's will, at last they learned to know the
                  doctrines.</p>
               <p>They had wonderful and mysterious hopes and loves, laid up in the unknown land.
                  Frank and May were beyond the grave; and beyond the grave, Mag hoped to introduce
                  Charlie to her own father and mother. They talked of it as a glad and beautiful
                  thing. Strange to say, Mag had never doubted their love for her, with all her wild
                  doubting; and she did not doubt their love for Charlie, because of his devotion to
                  their deserted child.</p>
               <p>But they had glorious earthly loves of brother and sister.</p>
               <p>And one spring-time found them with Guy and Lizzy at Rose Hill; the roses and
                  honeysuckles had learned to bloom in the wilderness.</p>
               <p>"This life of ours is a perfect romance," said Mag, one day, as they four lingered
                  over the breakfast-table. "But marriage is a serious thing, after all. Think of
                  the monotony of sitting down opposite the same face at table three times a day,
                  and three hundred and sixty-five days in a year."</p>
               <p>"Unutterably horrible!" groaned Charlie.</p>
               <p>"Human nature is so exhaustive!" continued Mag. "How do you and Guy manage to be
                  interesting to each other so many days in a year, Lizzy? I have discovered that it
                  is a terrible thing to have all we desire." Guy laughed.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said he, "forbidden fruit is the only desirable fruit in the Eden of the
                  world. Wealth, honor, fame and love are beautiful in the distance. We tire of them
                  all, when we have them in possession. ''Tis distance lends enchantment,' etc."</p>
               <p>"To quote Emerson," responded Lizzy, mischievously, "'The accepted and betrothed
                  lover has lost the wildest charm of his maiden, in her acceptance of him. She was
                  heaven while he pursued her as a star, she cannot be heaven if she stoops to such
                  a one as he.'"</p>
               <p>"Therefore," said Mag, "a woman must never permit even her husband to suspect her
                  devotion, or she loses it."</p>
               <p>"It is a great <emph>art</emph> to extract all the charms from existence, sis,"
                  said Charlie. "The heart has so many labyrinths, that it may require a lifetime to
                  thread them all and know them well. I have not begun to learn all the varieties of
                  Mag's nature, yet; and Lizzy, you will confer a favor if you will become
                  acquainted with a part of her, and give me an introduction."</p>
               <p>Mag laughed, and said:</p>
               <p>"Few find marriage what they expect or desire. One<pb n="444-445"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000225"/> philosopher says, 'If a man marries, he repents,
                  and if he does not marry, he repents'—all of which goes to prove that marriage and
                  human nature are great institutions, and must be managed with a great deal of art
                  to produce happiness."</p>
               <p>"Theodore Parker says," added Charlie, "'The intensest consciousness of friendship
                  does not last long; men have but once the ecstasy of love—all rapture must be
                  short—human nature could not long endure the tension.'"</p>
               <p>"Love is an evergreen tree, that blossoms all the year round," said Guy Erwin.</p>
               <p>"And bears twelve manner of fruits, and its leaves are for the healing of the
                     <emph>nations,</emph>" said Mag. "The nations of the world! the great, false,
                  foul world! so full of angels, too! or it would have returned to its original
                  chaos long ago, as a refuge from evil!"</p>
               <p>And they all mused over the sentiment, till Charlie broke silence:</p>
               <p>"This human nature is a strange institution! For somewhat less than a thousand
                  years, I have watched it—exhausting its charms, getting ennuied past all endurance
                  with it, and again amused past all knowledge."</p>
               <p>"The proper study of mankind is <emph>woman</emph>—of womankind is man," said Mag.
                  "How soon the sweet creatures do exhaust their charms! In a week we have fathomed
                  all a woman's knowledge, played all the changes upon mind, heart and soul, and
                  agree with the great philosopher Solomon, who knew the race so well, 'Vanity of
                  vanities, <emph>all</emph> is vanity.'"</p>
               <p>"Poor Solomon!" said Guy, "the race were the ruin of him, poor fellow! What a
                  fortune it must have taken to keep three thousand of them, in the height of
                  fashion! In these days, one woman in herself has the variety of character of
                  Solomon's three thousand, and it is not quite so expensive to find entertainment
                  in the sphere of woman."</p>
               <p>"You remember the three Johns, in the 'Autocrat of the Breakfast Table,'" said
                  Charlie. "Well, my Eve yonder is an improvement on even that variety. Besides the
                  Eve that Adam knows, the Eve as Eve knows herself, and the Eve as God knows her,
                  there is congregated in the personality of my Zoë an innumerable variety of other
                  Eves. She is a different personage altogether to every member of the universe who
                  meets her, and every <emph>time</emph> they meet her she is a different personage.
                  She might take the place of Solomon's three thousand. If you become acquainted
                  with one of her, one day, you may be obliged to be introduced to another of her
                  the next day—she is never twice the same; and, if at the end of a year or two, you
                  suppose you had learned all of her, you are as much mistaken, as if you supposed
                  you knew all the varieties of color in cloud beauty, or of form in sea foam. The
                  age is progressive, and mind progresses with age, and the Eve sitting yonder so
                  demurely, not only has mind, but cultivation and the power of
                     <emph>expansion!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"All that?" asked Mrs. Moore, in astonishment.</p>
               <p>"She is a perfect specimen of what is the glory of the American Union—<foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">E Pluribus Unum!</foreign>"</p>
               <p>"The subject is exhausted," said Eve Moore. "Men never show their real selves to
                  women; they come to them usually in the garb of angels, but when they dare they
                  put on the glory of the arch-fiend; but women to men likewise. It is an art to
                  renew the rapture of friendship or love; change, variety, action, rest,
                  recreation, succession, are the secrets. With these we may charm our friends, and
                  preserve love, and the heart itself may expand in the effort to forget itself and
                  make the happiness of others."</p>
               <p>"Jefferson said that the secret of happiness lay in finding employment," added
                  Guy. "Most men rush into employment to forget their longings, ungratified
                  heart-hunger and thirst."</p>
               <p>"Many business-men devote themselves to business, to forget in its rush of care,
                  that in their homes they find no communion of soul; men with physical natures
                  forget their home wants in sensual intoxication; intellectual natures drown their
                  hunger for intellectual home companionship, by study and intoxication of thought,"
                  said Lizzy Erwin, and her blue eye dilated as she went on. "Few women in this
                  southern country are treated as men's equals. That is one of the evils of slavery.
                  It enervates the young in both physical and intellectual energy. A woman at the
                  South never develops her energies; she is treated while young and beautiful as a
                  pet child; when her charms have faded, she still demands that worship, and
                  receives—neglect, desertion, or attention given from duty, not love or
                  esteem."</p>
               <p>"Lizzy, I am astonished!" said Mag. "A southern woman to dare say that of her
                  own!"</p>
               <p>"There is too much truth in it, both North and South,"<pb n="446-447"
                     xml:id="VAC6426-00000226"/> said Charles Moore. "When woman has beauty,
                  cultivation and religion, she has splendid power of conferring happiness, as well
                  as receiving it. And religion means self-denial, self-sacrifice, meekness—means
                  far more than the French Michelet teaches of love—it means all that the Man-God
                  taught of devotion."</p>
               <p>"Southern women have no motive for employment," said Mag. "Life is not life
                  without something to live for, something to be gained. We need a motive for
                  action, and some hope, and some necessity to attract and spur on our energies.
                  Southern women have neither; but they are the most graceful women in the world,
                  most regal in their loveliness notwithstanding."</p>
               <p>"Southern men and women may find motives for action and wonderful spheres of
                  usefulness at home," said Charles Moore. "They have already raised the degraded
                  hordes of Africa to a higher sphere; their work and duty is to continue that
                  education, and raise them in the scale of existence. Hugh Miller says that there
                  are races of men who can never be raised from their degradation. Nott and Gliddon
                  make use of this opinion to strengthen the argument against the unity of races.
                  England pronounces freedom in Hayti a failure, on account of the hopeless
                  sluggishness of the African blood."</p>
               <p>"Where do you get your authorities, Moore?" asked Guy.</p>
               <p>Charlie read from the London "Times."</p>
               <p>"'There is no blinking the truth. Years of bitter experience—years of hope
                  deferred, of self-devotion unrequited, of poverty, of humiliation, of prayers
                  unanswered, of sufferings derided, of insults unresented, of contumely patiently
                  endured—have convinced us of the truth. It must be spoken out loudly and
                  energetically, despite the wild mockings of howling cant. The freed West India
                  negro slave will not till the soil for wages; the free son of the ex-slave is as
                  obstinate as his sire. He will cultivate lands which he has not bought for his own
                  yams, mangoes, and plantains. These satisfy his wants; he does not care for yours.
                  Cotton, and sugar, and coffee, and tobacco—he cares little for them. And what
                  matters it to him that the Englishman has sunk his thousands and tens of thousands
                  on mills, machinery and plants, which now totter on the languishing estate, that
                  for years has only returned beggary and debts. We wish to heaven that some people,
                  not parsons or clergymen, but some just-minded minded, honest-hearted and
                  clear-sighted men, would go out to some of the islands—not for a month or three
                  months, but for a year—would watch the precious protégé of English philanthropy,
                  the freed negro in his daily habits. We wish they would view the blazonry of his
                  idleness, his pride, his ingratitude, contemptuously sneering at the industry of
                  that race which made him free, and then come home and teach the memorable lesson
                  of their experience to the fanatics who have perverted him into what he is.'"</p>
               <p>"There is some truth in the document," said Guy Erwin.</p>
               <p>"But we know that the generations of the negro race have risen in the scale of
                  existence since they first came to these shores from Africa. They have been taught
                  something of civilization and something of Christianity. Our duty is to help them,
                  as well as ourselves, to a still higher life. It may be that slavery in America is
                  to be the means appointed by God for spreading Christianity in Africa."</p>
               <p>"God has permitted it at least, for reasons known only to himself. It is the old
                  problem of evil, over and over again, till the heart is tortured by the unsolved
                  mystery. We only know that for some good reason God has permitted slavery in
                  America, and we must make the best of it whether we like it or not, and do our
                  best for them," said Guy.</p>
               <p>And the party adjourned from breakfast, to try the old hunting life in the woods
                  of Mississippi, with the Hudsons. All thought even frontier life a luxury with
                  such companionship. Anywhere is heaven if the heart is right. Christ said the
                  kingdom of heaven is within you. We know that the kingdom of evil lies in human
                  hearts. Heaven could not be heaven if a solitude, for heaven is love.</p>
               <p>And so life went on with these immortals.</p>
               <p>Never did Mag see a time when she did not need to lean upon God. There came a time
                  when she was an anxious watcher by Charlie's sick-bed. Then her heart was full of
                  prayer and pleading. But then she thanked God, because he had permitted an earthly
                  love so sweet and holy. She remembered then her promise, once made to him, that
                  she would be satisfied with one day of love: he had given her blessed years. She
                  thanked him for those years. She pleaded with God the Father to continue
                  them—asking blessings in the name of God the Son. She bowed her deepest soul
                  before him in the prayer, but said fervently, thy will be done. When Charles Moore
                  went to the unknown land, all her heart would be there. But God granted<pb
                     n="448-449" xml:id="VAC6426-00000227"/> her prayer, and he rose from his
                  sick-bed, and she continued her worship and trust, both in his manly strength, and
                  the Father who endowed him.</p>
               <p>Mag learned to be gentle to the erring. She would not judge the sinful—God might
                  do it; he alone knew how the tempter had assaulted them. Those who had been least
                  tempted she found judged the most unrighteous and unmerciful judgments. Christ
                  said, "Judge not, lest ye be judged." Christ loved the malefactor on the cross.
                  Christ loved her namesake, the Magdalene.</p>
               <p>There came a time to Charles and Magdalene Moore, when they poured out their
                  hearts to God with a great and solemn joy. A new life was born to them—another Zoë
                  commenced the journey of immortality. The child inherited her father's blue eyes,
                  royal features and raven tresses; her beautifully molded limbs were modelled from
                  those of her mother. She grew into wonderful loveliness.</p>
               <p>"Our life is blended in this life of our child," said Charles Moore.</p>
               <p>"And God's life is blended with it, and is to be its inheritance forever,"
                  responded Magdalene Barclay Moore.</p>
               <p>"Would you dare leave your child alone, to find its way through a world like
                  this?"</p>
               <p>"Do you fear for your child?"</p>
               <p>"It is God's child. He loves it better than earthly parents love their
                  children."</p>
               <p>"If there is a hereafter, and I know there is, I should not leave my child. God
                  would permit me to come back from the spirit-land to watch over her."</p>
               <p>"God has taken care of us. There have been unseen angels around us when we have
                  been most bitterly tempted. I believe it. God has taken care of us. God will take
                  care of the new life he has given us. We will keep her pure, to restore her to him
                  when he shall call for her again."</p>
               <p>"Pure? We keep her pure. She is earth-born."</p>
               <p>"She may have some of the wild humor of her mother to lead her astray—God grant
                  she may have her mother's energy also. Napoleon said there never was an
                  extraordinary man, with an ordinary mother. Weak-minded men, the sons of noble
                  fathers, have taken character from their mothers. It is a terrible thing for
                  humanity, that women are not more thoroughly developed."</p>
               <p>"Hush, Charles Atherton Moore! Do you not remember Frank's speech on the Xantippe
                  question? Our little blue-eyed Zoë may have the strong passions of her father to
                  control."</p>
               <p>"God gave her father those strong passions; he gave her mother her wild, playful
                  humor also; gave them with intellect and reason; gave them for some good and noble
                  purpose. He never endowed a human being with faculties, which, rightly controlled,
                  could not be made blessings to human existence, and used for his glory and
                  honor."</p>
               <p>"Passion is Destiny, Passion is Inspiration, Passion is Life," said Mag.</p>
               <p>"Mag's strong passion and wild humor, when guided, have made her brave in life's
                  testing hours. When she felt that she must walk the path of misery to the terrible
                  end—if there was no God, or he had forsaken her, when she deemed herself alone in
                  her helplessness, caring alone for herself—utterly God-forsaken—at least she would
                  go bravely and smilingly to her doom, and laugh at sorrow and thus conquer pain,
                  since tears were worse than unavailing. She has passed the temptation—(fortunate
                  Mag—many go to their graves in hopeless sorrow)—and now the wild humor gushes into
                  her home life, a daily, beautiful thing, shedding sunshine into the hearts of
                  those who love her better than life. It has been subdued by grace, and so Mag's
                  playful spirit has become only a blessing and joy."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Major Moore! I cannot bear all those honors at once. I must divide
                  them, for they are terribly oppressive. But God has crowned us with undeserved
                  blessings."</p>
               <p>"Given us a child born of Love."</p>
               <p>"Whose destiny is to be guided by Love, Hope and Faith."</p>
               <p>"And the new Zoë should be named Faith, for Faith alone can save it."</p>
               <p>The beautiful child, born in the South of its northern mother, was baptized by its
                  father with that sacred name. She was called Faith Moore.</p>
               <p>The great hope of the Union, North and South, is Faith, the child born of
                  Love.</p>
               <p>Faith, Hope, Love—these three—but the greatest of these is Love. On earth, Faith,
                  Hope and Love are guides to heaven, but the life of heaven is Love. God is
                  Love.</p>

            <p>This highly interesting work is the embodiment of much that is valuable in science
               and striking in incident. The facts and narratives here grouped together have been
               gleaned during a practice both varied and lengthy, and from sources the most diverse
               both in means and matter. The canopied couch and the lowly pallet—pampered luxury and
               starved mendicity—have each contributed to illustrate some of those phases, the
               peculiarity of which has led many a reflecting mind to exclaim—" Verily, life is a
               mystery, and death the solution thereof!"</p>
            <p>"Let us hope that, whatever truths useful to humanity may be found within these
               pages, will live for a little while after the hand that sketched them is resolved

                  last and best effort. We can truthfully say it is the most interesting book of the
                  day.</p>

            <head type="sub">BY CAPTAIN MAYNE REID,</head>
            <p>AUTHOR OF "THE SCALP HUNTERS," "RIFLE RANGERS," "WHITE CHIEF," "HUNTER'S FEAST,"
               "QUADROON," "THE WAR TRAIL," etc., etc.</p>
            <p>Containing nearly 500 pages, hansomely embellished with original designs, engraved in

            <p>The Historical Novel has ever maintained a high rank—perhaps the highest—among works
               of fiction, for the reason that while it enchants the senses, it improves the mind,
               conveying under a most pleasing form much information which, perhaps, the reader
               would never have sought for amid the dry records of the purely historic
               narrative.</p>
            <p>This fact being conceded, it needs but little argument to prove that those works are
               most interesting which treat of the facts and incidents pertaining to our own
               history, and of a date which is yet fresh in the memory of the reader.</p>
            <p>To this class of books preëminently belongs the volume which is here submitted to the
               American reader, from the pen of a writer who has proved himself unsurpassed in the
               field which he has, by his various works, made peculiarly his own.</p>
            <p>The brief but heroic struggle of the celebrated Chief, OSCEOLA, forms the groundwork
               of a narrative which is equal, if not superior, to any of Mr. Reid's former
               productions; and while the reader's patriotism cannot fail to be gratified at the
               result, his sympathy is at the same time, awakened for the manly struggles and
               untimely fate of the gallant spirit, who fought so nobly for the freedom of his red
               brethren and the preservation of their cherished hunting-grounds.</p>

            <p>So marked was the success of the "RIFLE RANGERS," both in this country and in Europe,
               that the author was induced to publish at an early day, the volume whose title heads
               this page; a work of more thrilling adventure, bolder incident, and glowing
               description than had ever before appeared in the same field of literature. These two
               books speedily achieved a high reputation for the writer, which he has sedulously
               striven to enhance by the publication of several other works of a somewhat kindred
               character. In all of these volumes has the powerful descriptive faculty of the author
               stood out in bold relief, and marked him as the DE FOE of AMERICA. The Publishers are
               happy to say that having secured the right to publish all of this series, they are
               enabled to offer to the public a collection of volumes, which in point of intense
               interest, are not only unsurpassed, but seldom equalled. A brief Synopsis of Contents

            <p>WE venture to say that there is no book extant which gives such a thrilling and yet
               truthful narrative of the stirring and perilous life of a Trapper, as does the deeply
               interesting and instructive volume before us. The author, whose powers of description
               are well known to the American reader through the medium of his "RIFLE RANGERS,"
               etc., has most admirably blended instruction with amusement, for, while "IKE, THE
               WOLF-KILLER," cheers the Camp-Fire with his never-failing anecdotes, the
               HUNTER-NATURALIST takes every occasion to inform the delighted auditory of the
               habits, haunts and characteristics of the animal under discussion, and this he does
               in a manner which cannot fail to fix the information in the memory of the reader. The
               following Synopsis of Contents may serve to give some idea of the adventures to be
               met with in this extraordinary work.</p>
