WHERE IS UTOPIA?&#xD;
!Heart-sick and weary of this life,&#xD;
With all.its envyings, toils and strife,&#xD;
A Poet cried, "I'll cease to look&#xD;
Upon the pages of this book :&#xD;
These cannot tell me what I ask-&#xD;
They are of mortal brains the task :&#xD;
They, all, from wisdom widely stray,&#xD;
Or point, at best, the longest way."&#xD;
And, saunt'ring forth, he gazed abroad&#xD;
'On all the beauteous works of God,-&#xD;
Where deepest azure dyes the sky,&#xD;
And jewels rare resplendent lie:-&#xD;
Tall mountain peaks and valleys deep&#xD;
In the dim distance seemed to sleep.&#xD;
Still, lost in wonder most profound&#xD;
As he lay stretched upon the ground,&#xD;
He heeded not the night-wind's breath,&#xD;
As, cold and chill, it spoke of death,&#xD;
'Till, damp with midnight dew; his hair&#xD;
Was blown across his brow so fair.&#xD;
With hasty step he gained a chair&#xD;
Secluded from the damp, chill air;&#xD;
And, as the northwind whistled by,&#xD;
Hear him in his anguish cry:&#xD;
" Softly, gentle zephyrs, fan me,&#xD;
Lightly press my fevered brow ;&#xD;
My spirit bends before the tempest,&#xD;
Like some rudely shaken bough.&#xD;
&#xD;

 WHERE IS      UTOPIA?&#xD;
Linger sweetly ever near me,&#xD;
Gently press my aching brain,&#xD;
Let me feel thy soothing presence&#xD;
Sweetly lulling every pain.&#xD;
0, the spirit's weary longing&#xD;
For some isle of peace unseen&#xD;
And the fairy visions thronging&#xD;
Of a land that's evergreen,-&#xD;
Land of mrytle and pimento,&#xD;
Lemon and banana bowers,-&#xD;
Sweetly light-winged zephyrs fan me&#xD;
With the breath of tropic flowers !&#xD;
Come to me with perfume laden,&#xD;
Gathered 'mid the orange groves,&#xD;
Bring the breath of far-off Eden,&#xD;
Where no chill wind ever roves;&#xD;
Tell me of that land elysian-&#xD;
Whisper softly in my ear:&#xD;
I long to find the famed Utopia,-&#xD;
Tell me, can I find it, there ?&#xD;
I wait, impatient for an answer,&#xD;
It comes in sighing soft and low,&#xD;
" I come, responsive to your longing,&#xD;
The glories of my land to show.&#xD;
There the flowers.are ever blooming,&#xD;
And richest perfumes on the breeze&#xD;
Are ever floating, ever roaming,&#xD;
O'er orange groves and verdant leas."&#xD;
He had stood, in days of yore,  .&#xD;
In Rome, rich in historic lore;&#xD;
And ruins gray and missed by time&#xD;
Had charmed our wand'ring son of rhyme,&#xD;
Through temples and imperial halls,&#xD;
Once echoig proudest monarch's calls,&#xD;
&#xD;
If&#xD;
&#xD;
WHERE IS UTOPIA?&#xD;
O'er tombs of men of great renown&#xD;
Had pondered on their glory gone,&#xD;
Had strolled up to the Pincian Hill&#xD;
At sunset hour, so calm, so still&#xD;
The day-god sinking-in the west,&#xD;
Tinging the distant mountain's crest,&#xD;
While all around a golden light&#xD;
Lingered, as loth to quit the sight.&#xD;
Below, the city, ancient Rome;&#xD;
Beyond the Tiber, St. Peter's dome&#xD;
In stately grandeur rose to view&#xD;
Against a sky of cloudless blue.&#xD;
Unbroken stillness reigned around,&#xD;
Save by the fountain's lulling sound,&#xD;
Singing, he thought, a hymn of praise&#xD;
For that most beautiful of days.&#xD;
Much more of beauty met his view&#xD;
In that land so old,. yet new.&#xD;
Italia, in her gala dress !&#xD;
Sure, her sons must all be blest.&#xD;
But no, what means those tattered ones?&#xD;
They cannot be Italia's .sons.&#xD;
That maiden with the outstretched palms,&#xD;
And humid eyes, she begs for alms.&#xD;
Too true, Utopia cannot be&#xD;
Where dwell thy pangs, dread Poverty.&#xD;
He travelled many weary miles,&#xD;
Nor heeded he proud beauty's smiles,&#xD;
From land to land, with weary limb,&#xD;
And-throbbing brow, and eyes oft dim.&#xD;
Beaut'ful Venice met his gaze,&#xD;
A glad smile drove his gloom apace.&#xD;
Bright stars dancing in the water,&#xD;
Fit gems for earth's queenly daughter,&#xD;
The songs of merry gondoliers&#xD;
Fell soothingly upon his ears ;&#xD;
While the soft dipping of the oar,&#xD;

WHERE IS UTOPIA?&#xD;
&#xD;
So calming after ocean's roar,&#xD;
Lulled his tired soul to sweet repose,&#xD;
Nor roused he till King Sol arose.&#xD;
Then with his mind from languor clear,.&#xD;
He entered a gondola near,&#xD;
Which, darting as a fish at play,&#xD;
Traversed many a winding way.&#xD;
Fully employed were ears and eyes&#xD;
With rapture, 'till the Bridge of highs,&#xD;
Loomed up before him, awful grand.&#xD;
The halls of inquisition stand&#xD;
Gloomily before him now,&#xD;
While great drops stand upon his brow.&#xD;
He turned, and sighing, sought no more-&#xD;
Utopia on a foreign shore,     I&#xD;
But turned him to hxs own fair land,&#xD;
Where all men free and equal stand ;&#xD;
Her beauties long he had passed by,&#xD;
Though much she claims to charm the' eye.&#xD;
We'll transport him to his Eden,&#xD;
Where each breath with perfume laden,&#xD;
By Welaka's beauteous stream&#xD;
Lay him gently down to dream.&#xD;
Softly do the zephyrs now&#xD;
Lift the light locks from his brow,&#xD;
Healthful breezes sighing low,&#xD;
The long moss swaying to and fro,&#xD;
Rich magnolia buds so white,&#xD;
Whose perfume fill him with delight;'&#xD;
From the live-oak branches near&#xD;
Hark ! the mock-bird's note so clear;&#xD;
O'er him bends an orange bough,&#xD;
Almost kissing his pale brow.&#xD;
He starts, what means that jarring sound&#xD;
Close to his ears? Up from the ground&#xD;
He leaps ! ' Ah ! look, he's just in time,&#xD;
One moment and he'd done with rhyme.&#xD;
&#xD;
:7&#xD;
&#xD;
The rattlesnake with venomed fang&#xD;
Darts past, and, harmless, strikes the sand.&#xD;
Our Poet stands and stares aghast ;&#xD;
Hear him, he's gained his speech at last.&#xD;
"Gentle zephyr, softly sighing,&#xD;
Deluding mortals with thy breath !&#xD;
O land so fair, with Eden vieing,&#xD;
Why lurks amid thy flowers grim death ?&#xD;
Here I could live and dream forever,&#xD;
I love thee, 0 most beauteous land!&#xD;
But this is not the famed Utopia,-&#xD;
I cannot with vile reptiles stand.&#xD;
India's breath is not more balmy,&#xD;
Italia's sky is not more clear,&#xD;
O this southern land so palmy,-&#xD;
Florida, so 'bright, so dear !&#xD;
Can I find a spot where nature&#xD;
Rules with mild and gentle sway?&#xD;
A place where every living creature&#xD;
Lives in peace and harmony ?&#xD;
Somethingewhispers deep within me,&#xD;
As all things around me show,&#xD;
Nothing here can ease.these longings,&#xD;
No place is free from mortal woe.&#xD;
The Poet mind is ever roving,&#xD;
Seeking bliss on earth in vain ;&#xD;
Utopia-is a fond chimera,&#xD;
Living but in the Poet's brain.&#xD;

SHAD OWS.&#xD;
SHADOWS.&#xD;
&#xD;
o the shadows; how they gather.&#xD;
In my lonely room to-night!&#xD;
All the faces of my loved ones,&#xD;
Bringing with them past delight.&#xD;
o ye shades of loved ones, linger!&#xD;
Cheer me, sad and lone to-night.&#xD;
Happy childhood's friends area near me-&#xD;
Brothers four, a noble band,&#xD;
Gathered round a father's hearthstone,-&#xD;
Young and innocent they stand :&#xD;
Father, mother, sister, brothers!-&#xD;
Alas ! alas! a broken band !&#xD;
One by -one the band is scattered,&#xD;
Out into the world they go ;&#xD;
One by one - 0 how we miss them!,&#xD;
Yet we know it must be so.&#xD;
Could my arms once more enfold them,&#xD;
Never would I let them go.&#xD;
&#xD;
But the shadow sweetest, saddest,&#xD;
Is the mem'ry of my love;&#xD;
Dreams of bliss too soul-entrancing,&#xD;
Rivalling the joys above:&#xD;
In the dust all soiled and trampled&#xD;
Lies the idol of my love.&#xD;
Go, ye shadows, though ye leave me&#xD;
Prostrate on the grave of hope!&#xD;
&#xD;
THE DYING YEAR.&#xD;
Love, your mem'ry has unnerved me&#xD;
Back ! I would not call you up.&#xD;
Leave me, peace-destroying, shadows,&#xD;
Let me pray for strength and hope.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE -DYING       YEAR.&#xD;
The poor old year is weak and weary,&#xD;
Lay him gently down, to rest ;&#xD;
His death is sad, and cold and dreary,&#xD;
Fold his hands upon his breast.&#xD;
Speak of him in tones of kindness,&#xD;
Let his good remembered be:&#xD;
All his faults, his sins, his blindness,&#xD;
Pass into obscurity.&#xD;
&#xD;
All the heartaches he has given,&#xD;
All the groans, the sighs, the tea:&#xD;
The bonds of love and friendship ri&#xD;
Buried with his hopes and fears,&#xD;
Poor old year ! His weight of sorro&#xD;
And regret cannot be known,&#xD;
By the youth who comes to-morrow&#xD;
Till twelve months are past and&#xD;
Ali ! Old Year ! thy reign was fleet&#xD;
Yet 'tis marred by sad regret;-&#xD;
While his bright successor greeting&#xD;
There is much we would forget.&#xD;
The clouds above his bier are weepi&#xD;
Mingled tears of grief and joy-&#xD;
Grief for him who here lies sleeping&#xD;
Joy for to-morrow's bright-eyed b&#xD;

BY-GONE       HOURS.&#xD;
BY-GONE HOURS.&#xD;
A vision bright of by-gone hours&#xD;
Is o'er my mind now stealing ;&#xD;
So plain it seems - the buried-past&#xD;
So true in its revealing,&#xD;
Methinks I'm living o'er again&#xD;
Those happy, transient hours&#xD;
When life was all one blissful dream,&#xD;
Its pathway strewn with flowers.&#xD;
My happy heart more quickly beats&#xD;
At sight of some loved token,&#xD;
Or when perchance by one dear voice&#xD;
Some kindly word is spoken.&#xD;
I feel again warm friendship's clasp,&#xD;
And love's low tone is breathing&#xD;
Into my willing ear, and life's&#xD;
For me bright garlands wreathing.&#xD;
THE CLINGING IVY.&#xD;
We read of ivy clinging&#xD;
Around some giant tree,&#xD;
Poets are ever singing&#xD;
Its faith and constancy.&#xD;
0, 'tis very dutiful,&#xD;
This clinging love and trust!&#xD;
And it sounds so beautiful,&#xD;
Believe it all we must.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE   CLINGING IVY.                   17&#xD;
Our own fair mother, Nature,&#xD;
Has many varying dyes ;&#xD;
Some trees of giant stature,&#xD;
And some of dwarfish size;&#xD;
Some trees bear blossoms only,&#xD;
Some full of golden fruit,&#xD;
Some isolated, lonely,&#xD;
Leaves but their scanty suit,,&#xD;
Standing alone, defying&#xD;
The wintry wind and storm,&#xD;
With their sad, mournful sighing,&#xD;
But proud, unbending form.&#xD;
To these no ivy clinging&#xD;
To beautify and bless,&#xD;
Only the solemn singing&#xD;
Of weary, sad unrest.&#xD;
Where warmth and beauty glowing&#xD;
With colors rich and rare,&#xD;
And naught unsightly growing,&#xD;
The harmony to mar,&#xD;
Some tall, proud oak is swaying&#xD;
Its limbs before the breeze;&#xD;
Though inwardly decaying,&#xD;
'Tis monarch of the trees.&#xD;
'Mid luxury and beauty,&#xD;
And soil rich and warm,&#xD;
Not difficult 'the duty&#xD;
To cling to that proud form.&#xD;
So up the ivy creeping&#xD;
With timid love and trust,&#xD;
'Till the rude tempest sweeping,&#xD;
Low lays it in the dust.&#xD;
Behold it prostrate lying,&#xD;
Crushed by its idol's fall,&#xD;
Clinging still, though dying,&#xD;
To its love like a pall.&#xD;

Poor Ivy ! dying lonely,&#xD;
This sad truth well may show,&#xD;
The fondest heart can only&#xD;
Be by its love brought low.&#xD;
&#xD;
MY BIRTHDAY.&#xD;
&#xD;
My birth-day,! Darkly roll the shadows&#xD;
Which obscure the king of day,'&#xD;
And from gloomy clouds are dripping&#xD;
Rain-drops soft as foot of fay.&#xD;
Softly, lightly as they're falling,&#xD;
Hardly press they on my heart,&#xD;
For the dark and gloomy shadows&#xD;
Of my being form a part.&#xD;
And they must continue onward,&#xD;
Onward through the coming years-&#xD;
Storm and cloud and gloomy darkness,-&#xD;
Never ceasing fount of tears,&#xD;
All in one sjiort life are crowded-&#xD;
Must this year nojoy contain-?&#xD;
Must the shadows still go onward -&#xD;
Lowering clouds and dripping rain?&#xD;
Will the months bring me no gladness?&#xD;
Is there naught on earth for me?&#xD;
Naught for me but pain and sadness ?&#xD;
Saviour, give me rest in Thee ;&#xD;
Give me strength for each to-morrow,&#xD;
Disappointment's sting remove ;&#xD;
I will not ask surcease of sorrow,-&#xD;
Only guide me by Thy love.&#xD;

THE DAISY'S SE1M ON.&#xD;

THE DAISY'S SERMON.&#xD;
Life's cares, so heavy and real,&#xD;
To earth seemed bearing me down;&#xD;
'The years were bringing me ever&#xD;
The cross, and never the crown.&#xD;
Against a tall forest monarch&#xD;
I leaned, in heaviest woe ;&#xD;
My thoughts I tried to turn upward,&#xD;
My eyes would wander below.&#xD;
The earth with dead leaves covered,&#xD;
Which the chill winds whirled around,&#xD;
Was all-no, not all, for yonder&#xD;
Was a green, moss-covered mound.&#xD;
I pressed my hot cheek upon it,&#xD;
'Twas as velvet, soft and green,&#xD;
And, there, as chiding my sorrow,&#xD;
A Daisy bud peeped between.&#xD;
Though chill winds whistled around it;&#xD;
Or sighed through bare boughs above,&#xD;
Its mild eyes were raised to heaven,&#xD;
Bright, smiling with trust and love.&#xD;
It seemed to speak with sweet chiding,&#xD;
" There's work for me and'for you ;&#xD;
Learn, then, through all to be patient,&#xD;
He gives but what we can do."&#xD;

MY DESTINY.&#xD;
MY   DESTINY.&#xD;
I live upon a frozen sea,&#xD;
My little bark icebound ;&#xD;
My vision sweeps nor rock nor lee,-&#xD;
No hope of aid is found,&#xD;
Around, above, on every side-&#xD;
All,-ocean, air and sky-&#xD;
Stirred by no breath of summer tide :&#xD;
0 God ! could I but die.&#xD;
The seasons all alike to me,&#xD;
No mild breeze fans my cheek,&#xD;
No balmy breath from land or sea&#xD;
These frozen regions seek.&#xD;
An iceberg hoary by my side&#xD;
Has stood for years and years,&#xD;
Chilling affection's gentle tide,&#xD;
Freezing the fount of tears.,&#xD;
It tells me that my doom is sealed,&#xD;
I cannot flee away:&#xD;
0 God ! my very blood's congealed,&#xD;
By this my destiny !&#xD;
I pray, my agonizing crits&#xD;
Fall back unheard to me,&#xD;
They cannot pierce the leaden skies&#xD;
All frozen like the sea.&#xD;
I dreamed the sun so genial, bright,&#xD;
Had shed its rays on me,&#xD;
My little bark was dancing light&#xD;
Upon a thawing sea;&#xD;
&#xD;
I love, this calm sweet hour,&#xD;
To sit and gaze abroad&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
A VESPER HYMN.&#xD;
Before me warmth and beauty lay,&#xD;
A sweet hope lured me on,&#xD;
My eyes were on the god of day,-&#xD;
0, joy would come anon!&#xD;
But, no. A cold and cruel fate&#xD;
Has said " this cannot be ;&#xD;
The iceberg cold shall be your matex&#xD;
You never can be free."&#xD;
'Tis better that no sunlight warm&#xD;
Should shine upon my way,&#xD;
'Tis better hope should never charm&#xD;
Sweet feelings into play.&#xD;
For 0, this monster grim and high&#xD;
Which looms beside my path,&#xD;
Is ready, and is ever nigh&#xD;
To bury me beneath&#xD;
The chilling waves. 'Tis toppling o'er,&#xD;
And threatening as is wrath :&#xD;
O Fate ! I yield, I shun no more&#xD;
This living, breathing death !&#xD;
A VESPER HYMN.&#xD;
The sun is low declining&#xD;
From lowland, vale and rill;&#xD;
Its last faint rays are shining&#xD;
On tree-top, spire and hill;&#xD;
And twilight hour is creeping,&#xD;
With its sweet and silent tread;&#xD;
And the star of eve is peeping&#xD;
Out from its azure bed.&#xD;

By thy pure and stainless soul,&#xD;

By thy mind's deep treasures rare,&#xD;
By thy voice of melody,&#xD;

By that air so free from art,&#xD;
By thy tender, loving heart,&#xD;
By those;tears that freely flow&#xD;

My poor lone heart, so sad, so fond,&#xD;
Shall never feel it needs a friend.&#xD;

With strength from that bright world above,&#xD;

&#xD;
Says, " Earth's sorrows but enhancing&#xD;
Joys of Paradise."&#xD;
Lord, I hear these words entrancing,&#xD;
"Love, there, never dies."&#xD;
Blest assurance, care dispelling,&#xD;
Leaves no room for fears;&#xD;
Future joys my bosom swelling,&#xD;
Fill mine eyes with tears&#xD;
Tears from pleasure's fountain welling,&#xD;
-Drowning myriad tears.&#xD;
While I lay thus sweetly dreaming,&#xD;
Shone a ray so bright,&#xD;
Of that Light, the world redeeming&#xD;
From its long, dark night :&#xD;
And the white-robed host proclaiming,&#xD;
"Hail the King of Light !"&#xD;
Then on angel pinions pending,&#xD;
I was borne along,&#xD;
Onward, upward, still ascending&#xD;
'Mid a countless throng ;&#xD;
Harps and voices sweetly blending&#xD;
In a joyous song.&#xD;
Upward, yet still upward flying,&#xD;
Even to the throne,&#xD;
Where the unnumbered host are vieing&#xD;
Each to see the Son;&#xD;
Him, the blest, who for us dying,&#xD;
For us glory won.&#xD;
The vision's passed away, and leaving&#xD;
Me to this dull earth,&#xD;
Regardless of my bosom's heaving&#xD;
For the heavenly birth;&#xD;
Yet my mind sweet thoughts is weaing,&#xD;
Of bright heaven's worth.&#xD;

A LOVING .HEART.,&#xD;
&#xD;
It mustabe sweet to feel&#xD;
That one good, noble heart is true,&#xD;
That one there is to kneel&#xD;
And offer heartfelt prayers for you;&#xD;
That, though the world may scoff and blame,&#xD;
One heart through all is still the same.&#xD;
It must be sweet to know&#xD;
Of all the world one thinks you fair,&#xD;
And loves you well, although&#xD;
Your brow be shadowed o'er with care,&#xD;
Though slander's deeply.venomed breath&#xD;
May haunt you till you pray for death.&#xD;
How much of untold grief&#xD;
One loving voice can chase away !&#xD;
How sweet the kind relief&#xD;
From lips that pleasant words can say !&#xD;
Methinks 'twere even sweet to die&#xD;
With such a being hovering nigh.&#xD;
It is -it must be sweet&#xD;
To reign in one pure heart alone;&#xD;
Whatever fate you meet,&#xD;
To know that heart is still your own&#xD;
Though every other tie be riven,&#xD;
To such ecstatic joy is given.&#xD;

Written for and read before the Teachers' Institute at Buckingham Court House,&#xD;
Virginia, August, 172.&#xD;
EDUCATE THE CHILDREN.&#xD;
Desolation and want brood over our land,&#xD;
Gaunt poverty greets us on every hand,&#xD;
Our energies crippled; enervating care&#xD;
Unfits us life's wearisome burden to bear.&#xD;
Too long we have yielded to impotent grief;&#xD;
The years, from oppression, bring us no relief.&#xD;
Let us up and be doing, shake off each weight,&#xD;
And rise above trouble, defiant of fate.&#xD;
There are many immortals crowding us now,&#xD;
They are mentally starving, while, passive we bow&#xD;
To tyranny's yoke. Let them not cry in vain,&#xD;
We'll throw off our fetters, and be free again.&#xD;
Free to instruct them, our dear, innocent youth;&#xD;

Remembering our own happy youthful school-days,&#xD;
Our books and our pleasures, our lessons and plays.&#xD;
Oh! bright happy youth.! We look back to the past:&#xD;
Then look at the present, how strong the constrast !&#xD;
Here are bright boys and girls, neglected, untaught,&#xD;
Growing up all around us toiling for naught.&#xD;
&#xD;
Shall it ever be thus ? Shall the pure, sweet fount&#xD;
So pleasant to us, flowing out from the mount,&#xD;
Yield no drops to these dear ones, these noble boys,&#xD;
From vice leading them upward to purer joys?&#xD;

Oh, parents and guardians and makers of laws,&#xD;
No longer stand idle. Beware how you pause !&#xD;
Would you have your boys men, true, noble and wise?&#xD;
'Tis you that must thus make them, mnust help them to rise.&#xD;
You cannot, it may be, send them to college,&#xD;
Yet withhold not from them all useful knowledge ;&#xD;
Their young minds are thirsting all pure truths to know,&#xD;
Oh, let them not vicious and distorted grow.&#xD;
Your daughters! Oh, parents, this life is to them&#xD;
So vapid, so weary, without any aim&#xD;
Save only to live as poor toilers and slaves&#xD;
A wretched existence, then sink to their graves,&#xD;
Unknown and uncared for, their names soon forgot&#xD;
By the little home circle, the one loved spot&#xD;
Where they toiled for the few.God placed in their care,&#xD;
For another soon fills the once vacant chair.&#xD;
Let science, fair science but smile on them now,&#xD;
Let wreaths of true knowledge encircle their brow,&#xD;
Nepenthe for sorrow, enhancer of joy!&#xD;
Oh, make them too wise for a vain, useless toy.&#xD;
Let science unroll them her mystical page ;&#xD;
Let them be, if they will, as wise as a sage;&#xD;
Let them measure the planets and trace their track,&#xD;
Let them learn all beautifil things, in fact.&#xD;
Oh, make them men's equal - in learning, I mean -&#xD;
They want not the ballot, they'd reign the heart's queen;&#xD;
But give them true wisdom for all aims in life,&#xD;
'Twill make them more worthy as mother and wife.&#xD;
But how shall we do this ? What wonderful power&#xD;
Will give to the children this beautiful dower?&#xD;
The Public School System, conducted with care,&#xD;
Distributes to each one of knowledge a share. -&#xD;

Now, teachers, the children entrusted to you&#xD;
Have hearts of affection warm, tender and true,&#xD;
Sensitive and shrinking. . Should they appear dull,&#xD;
Speak to them kindly; your reward will.be full.&#xD;
All are not alike brilliant, nor are all bold ;&#xD;
Some are timid, not stubborn; pray do not scold,&#xD;

THE LOVE CHASE OF A CONFEDERATE SOLDIER.&#xD;
A ROMANCE OF THE WAR.&#xD;
CHAPTER I.&#xD;
" All the world's a stage,&#xD;
And all the men and women merely players."-Shakspeare.&#xD;
The wind howled dismally around Drewry's Bluff in January,&#xD;
1864, as Captain Merton, of a Georgia battery, sat reading-now&#xD;
and then calling impatiently to a lad near him:&#xD;
" Tom, hasn't that lazy mail-carrier arrived yet ?-"&#xD;
Very soon the mail for his company was brought in and dis-&#xD;
tributed. Several letters bearing unmistakable signs of feminine&#xD;
chirography, directed .to Captain Edgar Merton, were laid aside&#xD;
for perusal at his leisure.&#xD;
That my readers may understand my hero's impatience, I will&#xD;
state, that to relieve the monotony of a soldier's life in winter&#xD;
quarters, he had conceived and executed the bold plan of adver-&#xD;
tising for a female correspondent, with a view to matrimony. To&#xD;
do him justice, it is but right to say he never once thought of&#xD;
gaining a wife by such means. His only wish was to make the&#xD;
wheels of time drag less wearily until the spring weather should&#xD;
permit him, once more, to see active service.&#xD;
Tall agd commanding in figure, with a bold open countenance,&#xD;
and an eye of piercing black which quailed not before the gaze of&#xD;
the bravest of his enemies, yet as tender and sympathetic as a&#xD;
woman toward the suffering of either friend or foe. He was one&#xD;
to adorn the rebel grey, aird one whom any lady might be proud&#xD;
to call friend or lover.&#xD;
Let us look at him as he peruses those missives in answer to&#xD;

his advertisement. There is a mischievous twinkle in his eye, and&#xD;
a slight twitching of the muscles around his finely formed inouth,&#xD;
as he tries to conceal his merriment from his brother officers, who&#xD;
are happily too busy with their own secrets to take note of his&#xD;
actions. Suddenly his whole expression changes, and the mirth&#xD;
is all gone, while a look of intense adniiration has taken its place.&#xD;
TIe holds in his hand a -letter, whose correct diction, chaste and&#xD;
elegant language, combined with its beautiful penmanship, elicit&#xD;
the admiration of our hero, whose love of all things pure and&#xD;
beat tiful has become proverbial among his friends.&#xD;
He reads and re-reads those charming lines until each expres-&#xD;
sion is indelibly impressed on his mind. Then he gathers up the,&#xD;
others --a dozen or more - and hands them to his brother offi-&#xD;
cers, who have by this time gotten through with their messengers&#xD;
from home, and are ready to make merry over these letters'of&#xD;
varied penmanship and orthography, but all having the same&#xD;
aim-that of securing a soldier correspondent. The favored one&#xD;
is safely stowed away in his breast-pocket, too sacred for any eye&#xD;
but his; while the name, LULA GRAVES, is repeated again and&#xD;
again in secret.&#xD;
There is a power, strong a, any the eye or tongue can wield&#xD;
over the most susceptible heart, hidden in the formation of a let-&#xD;
ter, or the arrangement of a sentence, a delicately turned compli-,&#xD;
ment, or a modest reproof, given by an incognito, and our hero&#xD;
walked as in a dream of fairyland.  He was scarcely able to wait&#xD;
for an opportunity to send a letter, so anxious was. he to hear&#xD;
from his unknown friend again. He wrote immediately, and&#xD;
insisted on a meeting. He would visit her at her residence, or&#xD;
meet her at any place she might appoint.&#xD;
Two weeks--long, weary weeks they were to him---passed ere&#xD;
he received an answer. When it came he was more firmly en-&#xD;
chained"than ever. She did not think a meeting advisable until&#xD;
they had become better acquainted by letter. She would inform&#xD;
him when she would meet him, and he must abide her time. In&#xD;
the meantime she would write regularly, and he must content&#xD;
himself with her letters.&#xD;
The correspondence continued for three months, until he was&#xD;
ready to do or dare any impossible thing .for the sake of his&#xD;

charming correspondent, so completely was he in love with her&#xD;
style of writing. At length, about the middle of April, he wrote&#xD;
to her that he would soon have to move with his battery, and, as&#xD;
he did not know his-'destination, he felt sure she would not deny&#xD;
him the pleasure of gazing, but once, on her lovely features, for&#xD;
she must be beautiful as an angel.&#xD;
He did not have to wait long for an answer, and it would be&#xD;
difficult to imagine his ecstasy when he read that she would meet&#xD;
him on the evening of the 28th on "Lovers' Leap," a romantic&#xD;
cliff on James river. All necessary preparations for his departure&#xD;
were immediately made, and he set out for the appointed /place of&#xD;
meeting with high hopes and such feelings as may be better im-&#xD;
agined than described. We will leave him for a while to look&#xD;
after his correspondent.&#xD;

Let us look into a quiet family party, this bleak December day.&#xD;
Everything bespeaks plenty and comfort. A cheerful wood-fire&#xD;
is burning in the sitting-room, while a knot of lightwood is&#xD;
throwing its bright light all over the room. The latest papers&#xD;
are lying on the candle-stand, where stands a regular Confederate&#xD;
candle, made of ,a long wick dipped in melted beeswax and rosin,&#xD;
and twisted fantastically around .an upright stand of pine-wood.&#xD;
The father, a fine-looking, dignified old Virginia gentleman, turns&#xD;
his candle so as to raise the wick a little higher, and proceeds to&#xD;
read the news out to a group of attentive listeners - his wife and&#xD;
daughter, who are busily engaged knitting socks for the soldiers,&#xD;
and a young son, who listens to each recital of dangerous exploits&#xD;
performed by dashing cavalrymen, and wishes he were old enough&#xD;
to be with his brothers in the thickest of the fight.&#xD;

AD VERTISING FOR A' WIFE.&#xD;
&#xD;
After a while the old man grows weary of reading long-winded&#xD;
editorials and thrilling accounts of cavalry adventures, and looks&#xD;
over the advertisements. Soon he turns with a simile, " See here,&#xD;
Carrie, a soldier is in want of a wife. There is a chance for you."&#xD;
And lie laughinglyread out the notice, not thinking of it five&#xD;
minutes later, nor ever once thinking his beautiful Carrie, petted&#xD;
and spoiled as she had ever -been, would ever need the assistance&#xD;
of a newspaper advertisement to get her a companion. Nor did&#xD;
she give the subject a second thought, until a few days later, a&#xD;
young friend of hers - as merry as, and even more thoughtless&#xD;
than herself-proposed that she should answer it. " Just for fun,&#xD;
you know, Carrie dear. Oh, it would be so charming !" And the&#xD;
two talked it over until it was decided, that Carrie should answer&#xD;
it, and Fannie Archer was to see the correspondence, and enjoy it.&#xD;
Thus it was that Carrie Conway began a correspondence which&#xD;
was to have an effect on her after-life she little expected then.&#xD;
The letter was sent and received with what emotions we have&#xD;
already seen, and another and another of his letters stowed away,&#xD;
--no one being cognisant of the affair except Carrie's mother,&#xD;
who remonstrated at first, but soon yielded her consent, thinking&#xD;
it all fun anyway and no harm could come of it; and Fannie,&#xD;
who read each letter, and hailed their arrival with more delight&#xD;
than Carrie herself; for Carrie often felt some compunctions of&#xD;
conscience and a slight fear of detection, as he became more and&#xD;
mere anxious to see her.&#xD;
Still she wrote on, urged by the fair syren Fannie Archer, who&#xD;
was as much carried away with his letters as he was with Carrie's,&#xD;
and secretly hoped that some chance would throw him in her way.&#xD;
Carrie was more prepossessed in favor of her unknown admirer&#xD;
than she dared confess, even to herself; so she thought in secret&#xD;
of breaking off the correspondence, for the reason that he was too&#xD;
noble to be trifled with. She dare not let him come up there, only.&#xD;
to be deceived. The idea of meeting him was out of the question.&#xD;
Her native modesty revolted at the idea of becoming acquainted&#xD;
with a suitor in that manner.&#xD;
She was more and more perplexed as he continued to urge a&#xD;
meeting, while Fannie urged it as much as he did. She brought&#xD;
forward every argument which she knew would possess weight&#xD;
&#xD;

with an imaginative mind. There could. not possibly be any harm&#xD;
in letting him visit " Lovers' Leap." The beautiful scenery would&#xD;
well repay him for any disappointment he might meet with. He&#xD;
praised his Georgia scenery - her Tallula and Toccoa -her&#xD;
Stone Mountain, &amp;amp;c., but he had never seen our noble James&#xD;
above Richmond, and she thought he would not regret a visit to&#xD;
that romantic spot. And then it would be so romantic to have a&#xD;
knight-errant wandering about in search of an unknown "Ladye,"&#xD;
or sitting forlornly on "Lovers' Leap," awaiting her arrival&#xD;
Then she would contrive some way by which he and Carrie&#xD;
should meet without his knowing she was " Lula Graves." Oh,&#xD;
it would be ch arming! better than a novel. Everything was6o&#xD;
dull now. the boys were all in the army, and this promised to be a&#xD;
genuine romance in real life, better than .anything in the" Wa-&#xD;
verley Novels." Thus were her scruples overcome, and the letter&#xD;
forwarded, inviting him to meet her on "Lovers' Leap."&#xD;
It would be difficult to describe the contending emotions which&#xD;
swayed Carrie.Conway during 'the short space of time which in-&#xD;
tervened between the writing of her letter and the 28th of April,&#xD;
the time appointed for the meeting. She became restless and exci.&#xD;
table to such a degree that her parents noted and commented on her&#xD;
appearance.- At length the day and hour arrived, and Fannie&#xD;
came galloping on horseback to inform Carrie that a strange man&#xD;
was sitting on "Lovers' Leap." It was arranged that he should&#xD;
be invited to Mr. Archer's, and Fannie returned home full of&#xD;
bright anticipations. It would be just as she had wished; she&#xD;
would see him first, and Carrie's power over' him would be&#xD;
nothing compared to her arts and fascinating insinuations.&#xD;
Many had been the true worshippers at the shrie of Carrie&#xD;
Conway's beauty and real worth. Kind-hearted as she was, no&#xD;
pleasure could be derived from causing another pain, and she felt&#xD;
sad whenever she had to refuse a suitor for her hand. Now she&#xD;
felt more so than usual, because she had enticed a stranger so far&#xD;
only to deceive him. Taking her mother into her confidence,&#xD;
they arranged a plan by which the stranger should be entertained&#xD;
by them, without knowing she was his unknown friend. They&#xD;
would relieve by kind attentions, as much as they could, the dis-&#xD;
agreeable feeling under which he must be laboring.&#xD;

troduced. - A beautiful blonde, with soft, dreamy eyes of deepest&#xD;
azure. Gay, and at times what we will call wild, she could be as&#xD;
mild as a May morning when it suited her. To-night she has a&#xD;
purpose to accomplish, and is as modest and retiring as possible,&#xD;
while a look of consciousness she evidently tries to overcome at-&#xD;
tracts the attention of our hero. He does not wish to make the&#xD;
object of his visit public, therefore he is quite wary in his obser-&#xD;
vations. He does not appear to notice Miss Fannie more than&#xD;
her more deserving sister, still his ears are open to every word&#xD;
she utters in her soft, almost musical tone, and'his eyes take in&#xD;
every motion, and his thoughts run in this strain: If she be Lula&#xD;
Graves, as she tries to make me believe, I shall go no further&#xD;
toward an acquaintance; she has no right to expect it of me,&#xD;
after the deception of this afternoon - and he made himself very&#xD;
agreeable to her quiet, lady-like sister. She knew nothing of the&#xD;
object of his visit, and treated him as she did all soldiers, kindly,&#xD;
and made a much better impression than Fannie did.&#xD;
The next morning found him at " Lovers' Leap " again, where&#xD;
he sat for several hours. He was disappointed and vexed, but&#xD;
determined to make the most of his visit by seeing as much of&#xD;
the country as possible.&#xD;
"Incontemplationis his proud recourse.&#xD;
'Tis poor, as proud, by converse unsustained,&#xD;
Rude thought runs wild in contemplation's field&#xD;
Converse, the message, breaks it to the bit&#xD;
Of due restraint."&#xD;
So he felt, as he sat in lonely solitude. Oh for some gentle&#xD;
spirit to commune with his of all this beauty ! - Some one to the&#xD;
manor born, to instruct him in the legends of this wild and pic-&#xD;
&#xD;
38&#xD;
&#xD;
There is on the banks of the James a very romantic bluff,, a&#xD;
large rock overhanging the canal, known as the "Lovers' Leap."&#xD;
There are so many conflicting stories with regard to the origin of&#xD;
the name, that one is lost in conjecture as to the truth of either&#xD;
of them; though I am inclined to think that of the Indian Chief's&#xD;
daughter the most probable, as well as the most romantic of all.&#xD;
It wassaid that long ere the white man began, to settle on the&#xD;
banks of our noble river, an Indian chief's daughter loved and&#xD;
was beloved by a hostile chief. Her father became so enraged&#xD;
that he threatened to kill his daughter and her lover if they ever&#xD;
met again. It is true, I believe, with all nations as with ours,&#xD;
that opposition lends force to love. It was so with the Indian&#xD;
lovers ; they met, and were surprised by the ehaged father and&#xD;
some of his braves. They fled, and were pursued until they&#xD;
reached the bluff, where they halted, unable to proceed further,&#xD;
until their pursuers drew near, when, finding escape impossible,&#xD;
he folded his arms around her, and both leaped together from the.&#xD;
brink of the overhanging rock, preferring death together, to sep-&#xD;
aration or a father's fury.-&#xD;
No doubt many a tale of love has been breathed into willing&#xD;
ears on that same spot since the white man has turned those&#xD;
forests into fertile fields ; and here our hero thought to behold, for&#xD;
the first time, one who, he thought, could be scarcely less than&#xD;
angel.&#xD;
As he reached the brink of the cliff he stood in rapt wonder&#xD;
and admiration, forgetting for a moment the object of his visit in&#xD;
contemplating the beauty and grandeur of nature. But as, the&#xD;
hour passed and nothing was seen of his incognito, he became rest-&#xD;
less and impatient, the thought for the first time intruding itself&#xD;
into his mind that he had come on a fol's errand. He lingered&#xD;
until the darkness of night slhut out all objects from his vision,&#xD;
then turned slowly away as loth to relinquish all hope of meeting&#xD;
Lula there. He' sauntered slowly toward a dwelling not far off,&#xD;
where dwelt an unmarried gentleman, who kindly extended the&#xD;

turesque scene. It must have a history, and oh to learn that&#xD;
history from Lula Graves, whose brilliant powers of imagination&#xD;
could give it a word-painting more beautiful than any work of&#xD;
art ! As lie thinks of all this, he exclaims with Dr. Young--&#xD;
"Nature, in zeal for human amity,&#xD;
Denies, or damps an undivided joy."&#xD;
This spot must be a monument, lasting as time, to an unre-&#xD;
quited affection, or a disappointed love,:from some cause. Why&#xD;
should I be disappointed? I might have known the days of&#xD;
romance were over, and no lady of true maidenly delicacy would&#xD;
meet me as I proposed, and I could not love her if she did. Can&#xD;
Miss Archer be Lula-my Lula ? No, she is fair, but she could&#xD;
never write such letters. I must go away from here  satisfied.&#xD;
In the din of battle I shall soon have an opportunity o forget it&#xD;
all. My country must be my only love-; and he walked slowly&#xD;
toward the postoffice to await the arrival of the down packet to&#xD;
take him back to his command. As he neared the group of men&#xD;
standing in' front of the office, his host, Mr. Williams, spoke:&#xD;
"Here is a letterfor you, Captain." He took it and walked away&#xD;
from the group to read it. His eye kindled with renewed hope&#xD;
as he recognised the handwriting, and he tore it open hastily and&#xD;
read-&#xD;
" Captain Merton: By calling at .Mr. Conway's this afternoon&#xD;
at five o'clock you will meet with and obtain an explanation from&#xD;
your                      ,                      LLA."&#xD;

At Mr. Conway's beautiful residence all was quiet enjoyment;&#xD;
its inmates happy in a consciousness of duty faithfully performed.&#xD;
The absence of loved ones in the army caused a shade of sadness&#xD;
to flit, now and then, athwart their features, and made them   par-&#xD;

ticularly kind to soldiers. Their house was always open to receive&#xD;
the defenders of their home and rights. It was no matter of&#xD;
, comment, then, that Captain Merton should ask for entertainment&#xD;
for the night, upon a plea of -business for his government. He&#xD;
might have remained a month upon that plea without causing a&#xD;
thought of distrust to enter the mind of a member- of the Conway&#xD;
family.&#xD;
There was one, however, who was, seemingly, as indifferent&#xD;
as could be with regard to thedbusinessbof the stranger, whose&#xD;
heart gave a quicker bound, and whose brow and cheek flushed&#xD;
to a crimson hue as his name was announced. It was but for an&#xD;
instant, however, and she became as calm and self-possessed as&#xD;
the most consummate actress could desire. She dare not appear&#xD;
backward in entertaining hind lest he should suspect her. His&#xD;
easy, gentlemanly manners made it no difficult task to converse&#xD;
with him freely upon the topics of the day, whl tohite&#xD;
hours passed away so pleasantly he quite forgot, in the society of&#xD;
so charming a being as Carrie, that he was there to meet another.&#xD;
She longed to know his thoughts upon a certain subject, yet&#xD;
dreaded to hear it mentioned.                            d&#xD;
At tea the subject of the scenery along the river was introduced,&#xD;
. and his thoughts flew with lightning speed to the object of his&#xD;
visit. He kept silent, however, though his eyes were raised in-&#xD;
voluntarily to Miss Conway, who slightly colored as she met his&#xD;
Ze. Tea overMr. Con ay led the way to the parlor, and re-&#xD;
ested Carrie to fa "-fhem with some music, which request she&#xD;
proceeded to comply with, glad of any excuse to avoid a tete-a-&#xD;
tete. She was a musician by nature, and highly polished by art,&#xD;
and her father was proud of her proficiency. She was a little ex-&#xD;
cited and nervous at first, but her love of music, that sweet re-&#xD;
finer of human nature, soon gained the mastery over every other,&#xD;
emotion, and her fingers moved over the polished. keys of her&#xD;
piano with such grace as Captain Merton thought he had never&#xD;
seen before. He asked for a song, and soon her voice rose in such&#xD;
strains of birdlike melody, he sat entranced, the ecstatic thought&#xD;
gaining upon his mind, "This is my Lula; it must be she; but&#xD;
Oh how far surpassing anything my fancy painted her ! brighter&#xD;
in comparison with Miss Archer than the sun is compared with&#xD;

He stood beside her and turned her music. At length, as she&#xD;
closed a very brilliant song, he wrote on a slip of paper, and.&#xD;
placed before her, "Do you know Lula Graves ?"&#xD;
She raised her eyes to his, those large hazel eyes, shaded by&#xD;
long, dark lashes--so inquiringly, and with such a surprised look,&#xD;
as she answered, "No, sir, there is no one bearing that name upon&#xD;
my list of acquaintances," that he colored, thinkig, " She is not&#xD;
Lula."&#xD;
Then, in a tone in which disappointment was strongly discern-&#xD;
ible,.he begaii and narrated the whole story. Her eyes never&#xD;
moved from his as he proceeded, until he spoke of his disappoint-&#xD;
ment, of her note requesting him to meet her. there. Then her&#xD;
eyes fell for an instant, as she murmured, " How cruel ! how very&#xD;
wicked, to treat you so. Why should she request you to meet&#xD;
her here ? It is very strange. Graves=- Graves - I never knew&#xD;
any one by that name. Whoever she is, she is certainly lacking&#xD;
in politeness as well as honesty. But pardon my indignation, sir,&#xD;
I did not nean to wound your feelings by speaking 'lightly of&#xD;
your friend."&#xD;
He smiled such a bright, untroubled smile, she thought he&#xD;
could not be much disappointed, and she felt a slight pang of&#xD;
jealousy: for while her heart was untouched, as far as she knew,&#xD;
by the interesting stranger, her vanity was not a little piqued at&#xD;
his seeming indifference.  Strange contradiction !' She was&#xD;
piqued at his seeming forgetfulness of her interesting letters,&#xD;
while that forgetfulness was caused by the superior attractions of&#xD;
the author of those letters. When he retired that night, Carrie&#xD;
Conway, Lula Graves, and "Lovers' Leap" were strangely mingled&#xD;
in his mind; while the very noble-looking, romantic stranger&#xD;
formed the basis of hei' dreams.&#xD;
He lingered the next morning, as loth to quit the enchanted'&#xD;
ground until he was forced to go to meet the boat which bore&#xD;
him back to!Richmond to meet his command; for his time was,&#xD;
precious then,. He dared not remain longer from his command,&#xD;
The hills were already reverberating with the sound of the&#xD;
deep-mouthed cannon. While a mystery still hung around his&#xD;
&#xD;
charming correspondent, be was very well satisfied with the&#xD;
result of his visit. If Carrie did not write those letters he be-&#xD;
lieved she could write equally as well, though he would be glad&#xD;
to know they were one and the same.&#xD;
A week later and Carrie received a very polite letter frm&#xD;
Captain Merton, requesting the pleasure of.a correspondence with&#xD;
her. It was with considerable regret that she declined what&#xD;
would have been a pleasure to her; but she had some honest&#xD;
scruples about the matter. What she had done was only done&#xD;
through girlish romance and love of fun. She had quieted her&#xD;
conscience by saying to herself, " Any one who advertises for a&#xD;
correspondent must expect to get answers from girls who would&#xD;
never think of being anything more than an incognito." Now&#xD;
she had seen him.and learned something of his feelings and dis-&#xD;
position. She thought it wrong to carry on a flirtation, or a cor-&#xD;
respondence which might lead to one. Therefore she wrote very.&#xD;
politely and candidly that she did not correspond with strange&#xD;
gentlemen, and must decline the pleasure of a correspondence&#xD;
with him. She hoped her refusal would not be a matter of regret,&#xD;
considering their very short, though pleasant acquaintance.&#xD;
A few weeks later he wrote again, saying he had tried, amid&#xD;
the din of battle, to forget her, but found it impossible. He was&#xD;
hasty, he knew=- that was the fault of his impulsive Southern&#xD;
blood ; still lie loved her as truly and fondly as if he had known&#xD;
her for years. She was the perfect reality of his dreams, his ideal&#xD;
of womanhood. His home was very lonely: no mother's or&#xD;
sister's gentle voice to welcome him home from the army, and he&#xD;
begged her to become the mistress of his hand and fortune, and&#xD;
the idol of his. worship, a fit divinity to be enshrined in the heart&#xD;
of the most. favored mortal.&#xD;
She replied that she was astonished at his haste in making a&#xD;
proposal of so momentous a character. She could not become&#xD;
sufficiently acquainted with a person's feelings and general suit-&#xD;
ableness of disposition as a life-long companion upon so short an&#xD;
acquaintance. The very fact of his making such a proposal to&#xD;
her under the circumstances was evidence conclusive to her mind&#xD;
that his affection could not be lasting. He acted too much from&#xD;
impulse. She believed in a union formed upon a congeniality of&#xD;

tastes and sentiments. They knew nothing of each other save a&#xD;

CHAPTER      V.&#xD;
"Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more&#xD;
Or close the wall up with our English dead!&#xD;
In peace, there's nothing. so becomes a man&#xD;
As modest stillness and humility ;&#xD;
But when the blast of war blows in our ears,&#xD;
Then imitate the action of the tiger:&#xD;
Stiffen the sitews, summon up the blood,&#xD;
Disguise fair nature with hard favored rage;&#xD;
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect."-Shakspeare.&#xD;
The spring and summer, yea the whole of 1864, was a time of&#xD;
terrible slaughter toy our armies. No time was left our hero for&#xD;
reflections of a private character. He had entered upon the du-&#xD;
ties of a soldier with seriousness and a* pre-determination to do&#xD;
his best for what he considered his rights, the right to do what-&#xD;
he chose with his own. He did not fight for slavery, though he&#xD;
had been reared with them, had been nursed by them, and many&#xD;
of his inherited slaves were almost as dear to him as his kindred.&#xD;
His boyhood companions and his playmates in childhood, he,&#xD;
never once thought of parting with them for money, and felt that&#xD;
he committed no sin in owning them. Still he would have yielded&#xD;
them up cheerfully on the altar of his country had they been the&#xD;
only cause, of dissension. He thought of all the hideousness of&#xD;
such a war, father against son and brother against brother ; and&#xD;
his thoughts turned to the war of the Roses, to the time of King&#xD;
Henry the Sixth, and he fancied he could see the son bringing in&#xD;
the body of his father, as he exclaims:&#xD;
" Ill blows the wind that profits nobody.&#xD;
This man, whom hand to hand I slew in fight.&#xD;
May be possessed with some store of crowns;&#xD;
And I[that take them from him now, -&#xD;
&#xD;
May yet, ere night, yield both my life and them&#xD;
To some one else, as doth this man to me.&#xD;
Who's-this? 0God! it is my father's face,&#xD;
Whom in this conflict I, unawares, have killed.&#xD;
Oh, heavy times, begetting such events !&#xD;
From London, by the king was I pressed forth -&#xD;
My father, being the Earl of Warwick's man,&#xD;
Came.on the part of York, pressed by his master.'&#xD;
King H.-" Oh, piteous spectacle! Oh, bloody times!&#xD;
Whilst lions war and battle for their dens,&#xD;
Poor, harmless lambs abide their enmity,&#xD;
Weep, wretched man, I'll aid thee, tear for tear,&#xD;
And let our hearts and eyes, like civil war&#xD;
Be blind with tears, and break, o'ercharged with grief."&#xD;
" Enter a father who has killed his son, with his body in his&#xD;
arms."&#xD;
Father.-" Thou, that so stoutly hast resisted me,&#xD;
Give me thy gold, if thou hast any gold,&#xD;
For'I have bought it with an hundred blows.&#xD;
But let me see; is this our foeman's face?&#xD;
Ah! no, no, it is mine only son."&#xD;
gingH --" woe above woe! grief more than common grief&#xD;
Oh, that my death would stay these ruthful deeds&#xD;
Oh, pity, pity, gentle heaven, pity!&#xD;
The red rose and the white are on his face.&#xD;
The fatal colors of our striving houses,&#xD;
The one his purple blood right well resembles,&#xD;
The other, his pale cheeks, methinks, present;&#xD;
Wither one rose, and let the other flourish,&#xD;
If you contend a thousand lives must wither."&#xD;
Many tens of thousands of lives had withered during the un-&#xD;
hallowed struggle between North and South ere the spring cain-&#xD;
paign of 1864 began. Now the terrible carnage began, and the&#xD;
Wilderness and Spottsylvania Courthouse will live upon the&#xD;
bloodiest page of the history of the war. Terrible, indeed, was&#xD;
the slaughter as Grant's broken ranks were rapidly filled up. Re-&#xD;
inforcements after reinforcements were hurried into action, while&#xD;
the shell and shot from   Lee's entrenchments mowed them down&#xD;
like wheat ready for the harvest. Many deeds of daring has his-&#xD;
tory to record of that bloody time, and many a brave man's bones&#xD;
lie bleaching on those horrid fields; while mothers, wives and&#xD;
children were left to mourn their hopes blasted and dead. Carrie&#xD;

daring performed by Captain Merton, who was promoted to Majoij&#xD;
for gallantry.&#xD;
Inch by inch was the ground between the Rapidan and James-&#xD;
1ivers hotly contested. Backward, receding as a hoarse wave,&#xD;
rolled the tide of war. Slowly, yet surely, on came Grant's over-&#xD;
powering numbers, .until the small space around Richmond and&#xD;
Petersburg was all that General Lee could claim. Grant, as a lion&#xD;
couchant, lay watching his prey, but too well satisfied of the fact&#xD;
that Starvation was an abler general than even the otherwise un-&#xD;
equalled Lee himself; therefore with patience he bided his time,&#xD;
knowing that sooner or later would come the downfall of that&#xD;
once powerful army, than which a more valiant was never known&#xD;
in history. My readers must permit me to glory a little in the&#xD;
valor of my countrymen, even though that valor was shown in a&#xD;
lost cause. Of one thing I am fully satisfied : had they been suc-&#xD;
cessful, all lands would have rung with their praise. As it is,. we&#xD;
can but admire the courage which can so bravely undertake to&#xD;
overcome an impossibility.&#xD;

then by a shell from the enemy's line of fortifications, which were&#xD;
close enough to admit an exchange of courtesies. "Get down,&#xD;

&#xD;
Johnny; we are going to fire now," was the frequent salutation&#xD;
of a friendly enemy, as he walked out for a breath of morning air.&#xD;
The mails brought him nothing of interest, only an occasional&#xD;
letter from his steward at home. He had eschewed all female&#xD;
correspondents'since his unfortunate visit to Lovers' Leap. No&#xD;
beauty could attract his eye; nothing animated him but the call&#xD;
"To arms." Now he became sad and dispirited; his beautiful&#xD;
home had been "Shermanized." Nothing left of all his wealth&#xD;
except his land ; the old family mansion in ashes ; his horses and&#xD;
cattle stolen; the few old family servants whose love for " old&#xD;
master's son" made them cling to him, remained-more of a&#xD;
burden than a help. Now, it was whispered that Richmond, and&#xD;
probably Virginia, would be evacuated soon. He knew too well&#xD;
that, if this were so, nothing couldanimate the soldiers to further&#xD;
endurance. He very rightly interpreted such a move as inability&#xD;
on the part of our Commander-in-Chief to hold the State-the&#xD;
newspaper falsehoods and pretences that. it would be .a great&#xD;
strategic move, if so, to the contrary notwithstanding.&#xD;
He thought he could see the hand of Providence in it all. Bad&#xD;
crops, and consequently starvation at home, while the soldiers'&#xD;
rations barely kept them alive, all conspired to unnerve the&#xD;
soldier's arm. He was not surprised then, though heart-sick and&#xD;
weary of everything, when the order came to move from Peters-&#xD;
burg without delay. Theaccount given by soldiers of that retreat&#xD;
go to prove that it was the beginning of the end. Had the sur-&#xD;
render been made at Richmond, much suffering and loss of prop-&#xD;
erty would have been avoided; but the people would have been&#xD;
dissatisfied, and it seemed to have been General Lee's aim to&#xD;
please the people. But these things are for abler pens than mine.&#xD;
Let us follow our hero on the disastrous march. Sadly yet&#xD;
boldly he pushed forward his battery. Out of rations, his men&#xD;
took a portion of the little corn issued to their horses, and, in&#xD;
many cases, ate it raw, their feet bleeding and. their whAle&#xD;
frame quivering with fatigue. ' When his battery was captured,&#xD;
and his men scattered and straggling, he e-caped the enemy to&#xD;
follow the hopeless fortunes of his division. General Lee pushed&#xD;
on, now and then turning to meet his pursuers, who harassed&#xD;
him at every step until lie reached Appomattox Courthouse.&#xD;

AD VER TISING FOR A WIFE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Here his army lay, massed a short distance west of the Court,-&#xD;
house-every avenue of escape cut, off. The idea of extricating&#xD;
his army from such a position by-fighting was an impossibility&#xD;
too plain to admit of a second thought. The only hope now was&#xD;
in a surrender upon good terms.&#xD;
On the 7th of April began a correspondence betWeen Generals&#xD;
Grant and Lee, relative to a surrender. The whole correspon-&#xD;
dence was characterised by that spirit of true bravery which a&#xD;
successful warrior feels at the downfall of an enemy who has done&#xD;
his best. General Grant knew that Robert E. Lee was an enemy&#xD;
worthy of his steel, and admired his noble spirit too much to&#xD;
subject him to any unnecessary humiliation. Even the savages&#xD;
of the wilds of America admired a brave man and treated 'him&#xD;
with kindness. . I believe it is generally the case that those who&#xD;
are never exposed to the dangers of battle and are too cowardly to&#xD;
fight, are the most, bitter against their enemies, and would mur-&#xD;
der them, even though they be disarmed and conquered.&#xD;
On the '9th of April the surrender was completed, and the&#xD;
South had no longer an army in Virginia. Many made'their&#xD;
escape to join General Johnston in North Carolina.  They&#xD;
reached him just in time to be surrendered. Among the number&#xD;
was Major Merton. With no near connection to care for his wel-&#xD;
fare, and but too true to an unrequited affection, which had out-&#xD;
lived twelve months of hardships such as none but a Confederate&#xD;
knows anything about; his fortune wasted by his enemies; he&#xD;
cared for nothing in Georgia. Still he thought that was his&#xD;
home;' he would see what could be made of the ruins. . He found&#xD;
no house to shelter him, and nothing that could be converted into&#xD;
money with which to build ; his broad, acres of fertile cotton lands&#xD;
would make some enterprising Yankee's fortune;, he would be&#xD;
forced to sell a portion, then why not sell all ? He felt that he&#xD;
coul not live on a portion of his inheritance, while the remainder&#xD;
w   owned by strangers. Then the old house with its familiar&#xD;
fu iture the dear old family portraits, were all gone. So he ad-&#xD;
vertised his land, and very soon found a purchaser. Now, nothing&#xD;
kept him there; so, with his pockets full of greenbacks, he re-&#xD;
turned to Virginia. Once more we find him, in August, at&#xD;
" Lovers' Leap." This time be came to see about a farm, which&#xD;
&#xD;
he heard could be purchased. As he sits on that rock, which is&#xD;
so fraught with disappointments to him, his thoughts are not of&#xD;
Lula, but of Carrie; and he sighs to himself: "I wonder if she&#xD;
is still unmarried. She said she could not wed an entire stranger ;&#xD;
I will settle near her. vI will not remain a stranger. Love such&#xD;
as mine must have its reward."&#xD;
A farm  was purchased a few miles distant.. It was well&#xD;
stocked, laborers hired, and our hero went to farming in earnest.&#xD;
He soon gained the reputation of an intelligent and enterprising&#xD;
farmer, and such a man could not fail to attract the attention of&#xD;
Mr. Conway, who had the reputation of being the best read man&#xD;
in the neighborhood. He entertained the idea that to be a good&#xD;
farmer one must be a learned man, a scientific man, and when he&#xD;
heard how his new neighbor was getting along, he exclaimed,&#xD;
" That is the sort of man for me. I shall go over to see him this&#xD;
very day." No one recognised the name except Carrie, and she&#xD;
did not dare to tell any one she knew him, lest the report that he&#xD;
came for her sake would be circulated. Even Fannie Archer was&#xD;
too much engrossed with the attention of a moustached merchant&#xD;
to think of the stranger whom she once tried to entrap.&#xD;
Mr. Conway was both pleased and surprised to find in his new&#xD;
neighbor, the rebel captain who had charmed him with descrip-&#xD;
tions of battles a year previous. A close student of human&#xD;
nature, Mr. Conway was rarely, if ever, mistaken in his estimate&#xD;
of character, and showed his partiality very plainly.  Major&#xD;
Merton was pressed to return the visit very soon, with the assu-&#xD;
rance that Mrs. and Miss Conway would be pleased to see him.&#xD;
He was not slow in following the dictates of his own heart,&#xD;
and Mr. Conway's parlor was soon lighted up for his special&#xD;
benefit.&#xD;

ADVERTISING FOR A WIFE.&#xD;
CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
O, my Lord,&#xD;
When you went onward on this ended action,&#xD;
I looked upon her with a soldier's eye,&#xD;
That liked, but had a rougher task in hand&#xD;
Than to drive liking to the name of love;&#xD;
But now I am returned, and that war thoughts&#xD;
Have left their places vacant, in their room&#xD;
Come thronging soft and delicate desires,&#xD;
All prompting me how fair young Hero is."--Shakepeare.&#xD;
&#xD;
It was middle October. The air was unusually soft and balmy,&#xD;
when Major Merton sat on the porch of Mr. Conway's dwelling,&#xD;
talking in a low, earnest tone to a very attentive listener. Carrie&#xD;
never looked more lovely in all her life, as with downcast eyes&#xD;
and crimson cheeks, her taper fingers toying nervously with the&#xD;
cord and tassel of her silk apron, she listened to those impassioned&#xD;
words whose very earnestness made them eloquent. The full&#xD;
moon made long lines of lightacross the porch, and glimmers of&#xD;
brightness sparkled in 'her golden hair as she bent low to whisper&#xD;
a response to his importunate pleading. Mirth and quiet happi-&#xD;
ness were struggling for the ascendancy in her moistened eyes,&#xD;
and the dimples around her beautiful mouth as she spoke almost&#xD;
audibly: "It is useless for me to try to conceal the fact that I like&#xD;
you very much, yet there is one thing about which I am not ex-&#xD;
actly. satisfied. When you came -to this vicinity on your first&#xD;
visit, you followed an ignisfatuus, as you afterwards thought. I&#xD;
have recently found your correspondent, and can assure you that&#xD;
Lula Graves is no myth, but is a living reality, and every whit&#xD;
as worthy of your love as I am. Had she met you, as proposed,&#xD;
you might have yielded to her what you had well-nigh yielded to&#xD;
her letters - your unchanging affection.  I have but recently&#xD;
heard you speak of her letters as-being nearer perfection than&#xD;
anything epistolary you ever read. Now could you meet with&#xD;
their author, and find her as fair and pure as her letters indicate,&#xD;
you would learn to love her far better than you, can love me. I&#xD;
will put you to the test. To-morrow morning at nine o'clock she&#xD;
will meet you alone at 'Lovers' Leap.' There will be no deception&#xD;
this time. If you find that you love heir, I will exonerate you&#xD;
&#xD;
ADVERTISING FOR A WIFE.&#xD;
&#xD;
51&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
from all blame; if you still think you can love me best, I will be&#xD;
yours. Until that test. Is tried, we will say no more upon the&#xD;
subject. I only hope you may find your unknown friend all your&#xD;
fancy painted her."&#xD;
He arose and walked the floor for several minutes; at length&#xD;
he stopped before her, and taking her hand in his, gazed long and&#xD;
steadily in her face, until her eyes dropped, and a' crimson flush&#xD;
suffused her face, then releasing her hand, he said with a- smile:&#xD;
"Be it as you say. I do not fear the test, but remember your&#xD;
promise, and you will be mine."  *  *    *    *   *    *&#xD;
Nine o'clock found him at "Lovers' Leap." If the October&#xD;
moon was so beautiful, its sunlight was still more so. The early&#xD;
frosts had tinged the margin of the beautiful James, and Autumn's&#xD;
gorgeous dyes variegated every clump of trees or shrubbery. A&#xD;
light fog was being slowly lifted above the adjacent hill-tops, and&#xD;
the frost on the grass and many-colored leaves glittered like rarest&#xD;
gems in the morning sun. There are brighter skies and -a clime&#xD;
where the leaves never fade, where the biting frosts of autumn&#xD;
never mar the beauty of a landscape ; but there is no, beauty more&#xD;
enchanting to us of the " Old Dominion," than the sparkle of the&#xD;
waters of our own noble James, as they seem to rise up to meet&#xD;
the kiss of the morning sunbeams.&#xD;
Methinks our hero must have been very much enchanted,-since&#xD;
he failed to observe the approach of a female closely veiled and&#xD;
shawled, until a slight rustling at his side caused him to turn very&#xD;
suddenly, and his face to flush painfully. He had almost hoped&#xD;
she would not come, and now she was there, what sh ,Eld he say&#xD;
to her ? At length the ludicrousness of his position burst upon&#xD;
him in full force and he laughed outright. He soon checked him-&#xD;
self, however, as she turned with a grieved air to leave him&#xD;
"Stay," he cried, "this is Miss Graves, I believe."  She nodded&#xD;
assent. What should he say next? He did not care for an ex-&#xD;
planation, but he really would like to see the author of those let-&#xD;
ters.. Then there was something enticingly romantic to a young&#xD;
man in such a position, so he mustered up sufficient courage to&#xD;
approach her and offer his hand with a smile, as he said : " Our&#xD;
meeting has been postponed quite tantalisingly, Miss Graves.. I&#xD;
hope we meet as friends now. At least the message I received&#xD;

AD VEILTISING FOR .A WIFE.&#xD;
&#xD;
on yesterday evening led me to such a conclusion. I have been&#xD;
cruelly deceived. Eighteen months ago I would have dared any&#xD;
impossibility for such a meeting. Now, when I had long ago given&#xD;
up all hope of ever seeing my fair incognito, you favor me with an&#xD;
interview. Can you explain the very strange deceptions you have&#xD;
practised upon me?" She spoke in a low tone: "You must&#xD;
never let any one except Carrie know of this meeting. Your&#xD;
advertisement in the papers attracted my attention, and prompted&#xD;
by a spirit of fun, as well as by the importunities of a thoughtless&#xD;
friend, 'I answered it. You know how I was led along by your&#xD;
flattering letters. When I began I had not the most remote idea&#xD;
that I would ever see you, and I would not be so unmaidenly&#xD;
now as to seek this interview, but for the purpose of dispelling&#xD;
my friend's doubts respecting' your love for her. I hope your&#xD;
meeting with her and the kind people of this neighborhood will&#xD;
plead for my pardon. I have regretted the deception very much,&#xD;
and have never corresponded with a stranger since, and never&#xD;
will again. Am I forgiven? " There was a something strangely&#xD;
familiar in the air and figure of Lula Graves, and her low, child-&#xD;
like voice had so much of music in it that he longed to see that&#xD;
tantalising veil removed, and he said in answer td her question,&#xD;
" You are forgiven upon one condition: that you let me see my&#xD;
fair tormentor. You let me write your sweet name, Lula. Now,&#xD;
Lula, my friend Lula, you will not deny me the privilege of&#xD;
knowing you.when we meet again, as I hope we will. As Carrie's&#xD;
friend, I hope to see you often. You will' not deny me a sight&#xD;
of your fair face when I tell you she has made that test a condition&#xD;
upon which I may claim her hand. I loved you as an incognito.&#xD;
I do not deny it. Your letters had a strange fascination about&#xD;
them, but it was not my fault that you failed to meet me, and I&#xD;
saw and loved Carrie Conway as a blessed reality. Let me&#xD;
remove that veil."&#xD;
She stood irresolute for a second, then with a low, merry&#xD;
augh, she said, "Be it so then," and the veil was thrown back,&#xD;
disclosing to her astonished listener the bright, laughing eyes and&#xD;
golden curls of Carrie Conway. Picture, if you can, my readers,&#xD;
the amazement of our hero as, he stood transfixed with wonder,&#xD;
until Carrie, with a'sweet smile and blush, said, as she extended&#xD;
her hand, " Which shall it be, Lula or Carrie?"&#xD;
&#xD;
." Both," he exclaimed, "for both are perfect ! Now am.I sat-&#xD;
isfied, since Carrie and Lula are one and mine, now and forever,"&#xD;
and with his native impulsiveness he folded her in his arms and&#xD;
imprinted the first -kiss of love on her blushing cheek.&#xD;
We will leave them now, reader, with the assurance that they&#xD;
are too busy with their own affairs to desire our -company.&#xD;
Madame Rumor.says there will be a wedding at Mr. Conway's&#xD;
soon ; indeed, that the invitations are already out, and adds that&#xD;
a certain bachelor's establishment is being fitted up for the recep-&#xD;
tion of a lady resident. As for us, we hope they will never regret&#xD;
that newspaper advertisement ; we will not if, they will invite us&#xD;
to the wedding.&#xD;

CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.&#xD;

E V I D E N C E.&#xD;
&#xD;
A.fifi'anda.      I have no ambition&#xD;
Fedirand. To see a goodlier man.&#xD;
Perdinand.        But you, O! you,&#xD;
So perfect and so peerless, are created&#xD;
Of every creature's best.-Shak8peare.&#xD;
On a cliff overhanging a beautiful Southern stream stood a&#xD;
neat white cottage, embowered in a grove of live oak, magnolia&#xD;
and orange trees.   Around the columns of the portico the&#xD;
yellow jasmine and the fragrant . honeysuckle mingled their&#xD;
colors and their odors. The space between the front door and the&#xD;
evergreen hedge which enclosed the yard was filled with choice&#xD;
shrubbery and beds of flowers, giving evidence of a refined taste&#xD;
m their selection and arrangement.&#xD;
Let us look within the dwelling, and we will see still further&#xD;
evidences of cultivation and refinement. There is no display or&#xD;
lavish expenditure of money; for the inmates, an invalid widow&#xD;
and her only child, a young lady of eighteen, are content to live&#xD;
within their income, and have something left over for charity.&#xD;
In the sitting-room you may see a handsome piano, and near it a&#xD;
stand, upon which lie several bound Volumes of music. Near&#xD;
this window, overlooking the river, is an etegere, whereon you&#xD;
may And rare volumes of history, romance and poetry. Before&#xD;
the window is an easy-chair. Close by is a sofa, where Mirs. Lee&#xD;
reclines to listen to music, or her daughter's voice in reading, or&#xD;
for conversation.  Those delightful evenings were frequently&#xD;
broken in upon; such rare' attractions could not be hidden.&#xD;
Mrs. Lee's long-continued illness .had prevented her daughter&#xD;
from mingling to-any great extent in the society of her neighbor-&#xD;
hood, though there were a few valued friends who found the way&#xD;
to that pleasant parlor since. Mrs. Lee's convalescence had per.&#xD;
&#xD;
mitted her to join them. Several gentlemen had called, and some&#xD;
were frequent visitors.&#xD;
Dr. Marshall, who had been called in to see Mrs. Lee upon the&#xD;
occasion of one of her attacks, found a magnet which drew him&#xD;
to the cottage much more frequently than the case demanded.&#xD;
For several months he had called, ostensibly to inquire after his&#xD;
patient, but really to see and have an hour's chat' with Miss&#xD;
Ethel; now and then merely stopping to leave a book or period-&#xD;
ical for her perusal, or to beg the loan of some particular volume.&#xD;
He was young, graceful in form and action, delicate in appear-&#xD;
ance, and with a high, intellectual brow. He was modest, yet&#xD;
easy in his manners, rather reserved in general society, yet very&#xD;
pleasant and sociable when he became better acquainted. With&#xD;
no fortune save a lucrative profession, an unstained name and&#xD;
high moral character, he felt that the world might consider him&#xD;
unworthy of Miss Lee; still heknew he was her equal in all save&#xD;
fortune. A man may be modest, and yet feel his right to the re-&#xD;
spect of his fellow-men. He may be very poor, may have to toil&#xD;
incessantly for his daily bread, yet know, without arrogance, that&#xD;
he is the peer of many who consider themselves his superiors.&#xD;
Mind will assert its independence of adverse circumstances. Dr.&#xD;
franklin owned to a little vanity, and thought it commendable to&#xD;
have enough to stimulate a person to exertion in any laudable&#xD;
enterprise. Dr. Marshall knew his power in his neighborhood,&#xD;
for he had attained to wonderful eminence in his profession for&#xD;
one so young, only twenty-six. Still he was modest and unaf-&#xD;
fected in his intercourse with his fellow-man. Mrs. Lee and her&#xD;
daughter found him a pleasant and congenial friend-" too inno-&#xD;
cent for coquetry." Ethel'-s heightened color and the joyous&#xD;
sparkle of her dark blue eyes at his coming were, after much&#xD;
doubting, rightly interpreted by the Doctor, who made no delay&#xD;
in telling her the story of his love.. Mrs. Lee gave a cheerful&#xD;
assent to an early marriage. It was just what she desired. He&#xD;
was to live with her, and be hef son indeed. Two- months from&#xD;
that-day was named as the wedding-day.&#xD;
Here I would gladly leave these lovers, happy in the con-&#xD;
sciousness of mutual love; but the true historian must record&#xD;
painful as well as pleasant facts. I must, of necessity, introduce&#xD;

his friend, feeling very sad, for he saw that his mind was tottering&#xD;
on the verge of insanity. Arthur Marshall had loved Isabel&#xD;
King as a sister, and she and her brother were expected to act as&#xD;
attendants at the bridal. It was the evening preceding the bridal&#xD;
eve, and he stopped a few minutes to see Ethel once more before&#xD;
he could claim her as his own. He sat long after tea in pleasant&#xD;
converse. He would not pain her by a recital of her friend's affec-&#xD;

when she followed him to the gate to bid him a lingering adieu.&#xD;
Not a cloud obscured the brightness of the moon ; and the lovers&#xD;
smiled as they thought the course of true lov6 had run very&#xD;
smoothly with them, and accepted this cloudless night as a&#xD;
presage of a bright and happy future. Sweet was Ethel's sleep of&#xD;
innocence that night. Did no dark shadows warn her of to-&#xD;
morrow's wretchedness ?&#xD;

another actor upon the stage. There lived on one of the finest&#xD;
estates in the South, just across the river from Mrs. Lee's, a young&#xD;
gentleman, of fine, manly figure, tall and athletic; a handsome&#xD;
face, with pleasant black eyes and beautiful glossy beard.. Add:&#xD;
to these a cultivated mind and a handsome estate inherited from&#xD;
a noble line of ancestors, and you have a tout-ensemble perfectly ir-&#xD;
resistible with the majority of young ladies. He was'considered&#xD;
the best " catch " in all that country, and the young ladies had&#xD;
curled and painted at him to no purpose. The modest violet had&#xD;
more charms for himn than the most queenly rose or stately lily.&#xD;
Henry King was (among the number who acknowledged the&#xD;
superior attractions of Mrs. Lee's pleasant cottage; and a few&#xD;
days previous to her engagement with Dr. Marshall he had pro-&#xD;
posed to Ethel, and been kindly but firmly rejected.  He and'&#xD;
Arthur Marshall had been friends from childhood. Their affection&#xD;
for each other had been compared to that of David and Jonathan.&#xD;
Now, many-things which had been unobserved before, attracted&#xD;
his attention,;and he knew, before his friend told him of his en-&#xD;
gagement and approaching marriage, that Arthur Marshall was&#xD;
his rival. He was an ardent, impassioned lover-had never been&#xD;
opposed or crossed in anything in all his life; therefore a rejec-&#xD;
tion of his suit had never been counted on. He tried to reason&#xD;
upon the subject, and for a time succeeded so well that not even&#xD;
his only sister knew how deep the wound was he had received.&#xD;
He went so far ias to congratulate his friend upon his success,&#xD;
speaking in glowing terms of the worth of his affianced, and all&#xD;
without betraying any undue excitement. But as the day for the'&#xD;
marriage approached he became gloomy and abstracted, at times'&#xD;
boisterously gay,- was several times seen to wander, as if in.&#xD;
search of something, around the cliff near Mrs. Lee's. His sister&#xD;
noted the change in his manner, and sent for Dr. Marshall to try&#xD;
to find out the nature of his malady. As he had ceased to go into&#xD;
-society, none of his neighbors knew of hi situation. When the&#xD;
Doctor approached him in his chamber he was rudely ordered&#xD;
to leave the house, and upbraided with having supplanted him&#xD;
in the affections of the only woman he could ever love. This was&#xD;
altogether new to the Doctor. ' Ethel's modesty had prevented her&#xD;
from mentioning her conquests, even to her betrothed. He left&#xD;
&#xD;
Bass.               And I beseech you,&#xD;
Wrest once the law to your authority.&#xD;

in Venice&#xD;
Can alter a decree established.&#xD;
'Twill be recorded for a precedent.-Shaksreare&#xD;
On the following morning Ethel was rudely awakened by. a&#xD;
servant calling to her: " Git up, Miss Ethie! Dr. Marshall done&#xD;
kill Mars Henry King down to the bluff; and de folks done carry&#xD;
him to jail; and Mistis she is dead. For de Lord's sake, git up&#xD;
Miss Ethie." Ethel opened her eyes, but half way comprehending&#xD;
what the girl was saying to her, when a sob on the opposite side&#xD;
of the room arrested her attention. She, started up on beholding&#xD;
her old nurse bending 'over her mother and chafing her hands.&#xD;
In a moment she was-beside her, and-their united efforts soon re-&#xD;
stored her to consciousness. When Mrs. Lee had been placed on&#xD;
the bed from which she had arisen in her excitement, in answer&#xD;
to Ethel's question, "What is it all, mother? '" she replied "Hagar&#xD;

will tell you," and closed her eyes in weariness. Ethel followed&#xD;
the old woman to the dining-room, when she learned that after&#xD;
Dr. Marshall had left her the evening before he went to the bluff,&#xD;
where he met Mr. King. No one seemed to know why they were&#xD;
there at that late hour; but Mr. Roberts chanced to pass just in&#xD;
time to see Dr. Marshall stab Henry King to the heart, that he&#xD;
(Mr. R.) then went)to apprise Miss King and the servants of his&#xD;
death, while the Doctor rode to town and surrendered himself,.&#xD;
and was then in jail.&#xD;
Ethel did not faint or give ent to any violent expressions of&#xD;
grief. For a while the news stuhvd her. She was deadly pale,&#xD;
while her fingers clutched each other convulsively. She could not&#xD;
believe it was all true, for why should he kill his dearest friend ?&#xD;
Still the old negro's story was told in so straightforward a&#xD;
manner she knew there must be some truth-in it.&#xD;
A boy was sent with a note to Dr. Marshall, and soon returned&#xD;
with a reply. "Come to me, Ethie. Do not shrink from me, I&#xD;
am no murderer, though the whole town seems to think me one.&#xD;
Come and let me tell you the whole story.-Your wretched&#xD;
Arthur." Timid and shrinking from anything like publicity as&#xD;
Ethel was, she felt that was no time for such scruples. She or-&#xD;
dered the carriage, and with old Hagar as her attendant, she&#xD;
hurried, closely veiled, to the prison where her lover, who was to&#xD;
have been her husband that day, sat, the picture of gloom. and&#xD;
misery. "Will Ethel believe me innocent?" was the thought&#xD;
which wholly possessed him as the jailor told him a lady wished&#xD;
to see him. He had not time to reply before Ethel entered and&#xD;
fell upon her knees before him, weeping bitterly. He tried to&#xD;
soothe her, but the fountain of tears had been restrained so long,&#xD;
she could not control them until she wept for several minutes.&#xD;
At length he raised her head and looked into her face sorrowfully.&#xD;
"You believe me guilty, Ethic? Do I look like a murderer ?"&#xD;
She started up an4eried, "A murderer, Arthur ! Oh, no, not that.&#xD;
I meant to comfort you, but it makes me so miserable to see you&#xD;
here. Tell me you will soon be released."  " Listen, Ethic, and I&#xD;
will tell you all about this horrid affair ; at least all that I know.&#xD;
When I left your house yesterday evening, and neared the bluff&#xD;
just above the bridge, I heard what appeared to me to be a person&#xD;

talking to himself, as there was only one voice. I stopped and&#xD;
listened, when suddenly a sharp cry as' of pain, and then a deep&#xD;
groan fell upon my ear. The ioon was shining brightly, and I&#xD;
galloped forward, as near as I could get with my horse. I then&#xD;
dismounted, and walked to the edge of the cliff, where I found my&#xD;
best friend, Henry King, just gasping for breath, with his face up-&#xD;
tur-ned to the moon and a dagger in his breast. Oh! Ethie, you&#xD;
can't imagine the horror of that moment. I drew out the knife&#xD;
and tried to stop the blood, but he was dead, without a word or&#xD;
sign of recognition. I arose from the bleeding body with the knife&#xD;
dripping with his heart's blood in my hand. Just then Mr.&#xD;
Roberts came up to me, and started back in horror as he saw me,&#xD;
and exclaimed, ' Great God, Doctor, is this you ? How did this&#xD;
happen ?' I told him all that I have told you, when he said he&#xD;
would go and get help to take the body home, if I would watch&#xD;
beside it until his return. I did so. When the servants from the&#xD;
mansion came with Mr. Roberts, I went with them to the house,&#xD;
saw Isabel, and told her all about it that I knew. She told me&#xD;
she knew he was insane, and he must have killed himself. She&#xD;
went with me to see the body, and fainted. I was trying to&#xD;
restore her when an officer entered and told me I was under arrest&#xD;
for the murder of Mr. King. He showed me .his authority. I&#xD;
found that, when Mr. Roberts left me alone with the dead, he had&#xD;
written anote and sent a servant with it to have me arrested. I&#xD;
am to appear before the examining court at twelve o'clock to-day,&#xD;
when I hope to be released. Isabel King's testimony will satisfy&#xD;
the court that her br there was insane. Our bridal will, neces-&#xD;
sarily, be postponed a cjay. or two, but I shall soon be free to claim&#xD;
my bride." Ethel returned home, happy in the knowledge of her&#xD;
lover's ihnocence, and in the belief that he would soon be re-&#xD;
leased.&#xD;
The examining-court met and found what they termed a true&#xD;
bill against him, and he was remanded to jail to await the spring&#xD;
term of the Circuit court, to be tried for murder, and the murder&#xD;
of the dearest friend he had., Public opinion is a strange, uncer-&#xD;
tain thing. Twenty-four hours ago, every person who knew Dr.&#xD;
Marshall believed him a model young man, and lie had the confi-&#xD;
dence and good wishes of all; now, there was not a dozen who be&#xD;

lieved him innocent. Miss Lee, whose name was the synonym for&#xD;
every virtue, was' stigmatised as being the .cause of the whole&#xD;
affair. It was repoi'ted and believed that Dr. Marshall was jealous&#xD;
of Mr. King, and had murdered him lest he should prove a rival&#xD;
in his wife's 'affections. Some were ill-natured enough to assert&#xD;
-that Miss Lee had tried every means in her power to secure Mr&#xD;
King's hand and fortune; that she did not love Dr. Marshall, was&#xD;
only going to marry him because she could not .get the one she&#xD;
wanted. Isabel King was    ill with brain-fever to make any&#xD;
statement. Old Dr. Hall  a by her side, trying in vain to re-&#xD;
store her reason.' Ike believed his young friend innocent, and did&#xD;
all he could for the defence.&#xD;
O the weary months of anxiety and waiting!. Friends tried to&#xD;
bail him out.. He was needed among his patients, but' the case&#xD;
was considered too desperate to admit of bail. Mr. Roberts was&#xD;
the only witness for the prosecution; but he was a man of high&#xD;
standing in the county, and no one doubted the truth of what he&#xD;
stated. Then circumstances were strongly against him.  The&#xD;
time of night, the fact. that they were together on that'par-&#xD;
ticular night and at that place, did not appear to the wise men&#xD;
to be wholly accidental. Five months Of prison life, with a pros-&#xD;
peet of something worse at the expiration of that time, presented&#xD;
no pleasant picture to his imagination.&#xD;
Poor Ethel! what a sad' termination to-a day which she had&#xD;
thought would end so happily. The night was as unclouded as&#xD;
the preceding one, still she saw no beauty in anything. Her&#xD;
lover in prison for murder, and her mother suffering severely&#xD;
from an unusually violent attack brought on by that day's ex-&#xD;
citement. Oh how wearily the long hours of the night passed&#xD;
away!&#xD;
Time, that great healer of wounds, i rched on with steady&#xD;
strides, and left some hope in Dr. Marshall's heart. True, public&#xD;
opinion was against him, and he heard that Mr. Roberts was very&#xD;
active-in prosecuting him. -Why he should be, he could not im-&#xD;
agine. He had always professed firm friendship for him. He had&#xD;
noticed too, that in giving in his testimony he told his story in&#xD;
such a way as to influence the court as much as possible against-&#xD;
him. Still there were some friends who did all-in their power for'&#xD;

him. Able counsel was employed. Ethel visited him as fre-&#xD;
quently as her mother's fast-failing' health would permit her to&#xD;
do ; supplied him with every comfort her kind heart could devise ;&#xD;
and always left him more hopeful than she found him. Spring&#xD;
came, robed in all her loveliness, and filling all nature with glad-&#xD;
ness; yet there was no gladness in Dr. Marshall's heart as his&#xD;
trial approached.&#xD;
Court met and the case was called,'but the witness for the&#xD;
prosecution was absent - unavoidably detained with a sick child&#xD;
in a distant State, so his excuse ran, therefore it must be post-&#xD;
poned for six months longer. Thought full of horror to those&#xD;
most concerned ! 0 the tardiness of the law ! How we fume&#xD;
and fret sometimes, when, if we could see all things at a glance,&#xD;
we would bless rather than curse such, delays.&#xD;
The offer of bail was renewed, with the earnest prayer that he&#xD;
might have the freedom of the town, but was refused. Such a&#xD;
thing as releasing a murderer on bail was unprecedented. That&#xD;
privilege was reserved for more modern times, when money can&#xD;
purchase anything, even a cowardly assassin's release from all&#xD;
punishment.&#xD;
Mrs. Lee, worn out by such constant care and excitement, sank&#xD;
to rest before the sunmer ended, and was laid beside her husband,&#xD;
leaving Ethel all alone in the world. Who canfathom the depth&#xD;
of the prisoner's sorrow as he thought of the suffering of her&#xD;
whom he loved so tenderly? Her plump figure had been worn&#xD;
very thin, and the color had been driven from her cheeks by cbn-&#xD;
stant watching beside her sick mother, arid her heart was'ready&#xD;
to break with its heavy load of cares. No one -had been en-&#xD;
couraged to cross her threshold for months except Dr. Hall, and&#xD;
Mr. Mason, hei pastor, and his family. Mr. Mason wished her to&#xD;
close her house and go to reside with'his family, but she posi-&#xD;
tively refused to leave the (ear old home. He left one of. his&#xD;
daughters with her, until he succeeded in getting an old lady of&#xD;
respectability to stay with her. To 'the outer world things&#xD;
seemed to go on as usual at the cottage. There was the same&#xD;
regularity in household affairs. The sanie poor families were&#xD;
visited and supplied with the necessaries of life. Yet the elas-&#xD;
ticity of her step was gone. Her cheeks grew daily paler and;&#xD;

thinner, and her bright smile was never more seen. Her visits&#xD;
to the prisoner continued, and there she' tried to seem hopeful,&#xD;
and cheerful, to encourage the pale languid prisoner to hope, to&#xD;
live for her sake. He still ne ded her strong faith to lean on,'and&#xD;
she tried to keep up for his sake. He was her all now, and her&#xD;
love was all that bound him to a world which had used him so&#xD;
badly.-&#xD;
September came, and with it the long, wished-for yet dreaded&#xD;
court. By some mismanagement, some informality, the mur-&#xD;
derer's case was again postponed. Six months longer! Eleven&#xD;
months in prison, and six months more of hopeless confinement&#xD;
yet before him! The sickly season was upon the town, and their&#xD;
favorite physician in prison. Friends and the sufferers generally&#xD;
begged for his release. Suffering, the presence of death in our&#xD;
midst, wonderfully softens the human heart, and men who had&#xD;
been ready to aid in every way in the prosecution of a man who&#xD;
had never harmed them, now came forward and offered their&#xD;
purses freely for his release  But the law was inexorable. Ethel's&#xD;
pale face was seen beside the couches of the sick, and the con-&#xD;
stant wish for Dr. Marshall pleased her more than anything else&#xD;
could do.&#xD;
Spring came again, and expectation was on tiptoe with regard&#xD;
to the great murder case. People wondered.why Isabel King did&#xD;
not return from her foreign tour to prosecute her brother's mur-&#xD;
derer. Mr. Roberts said he had the power to act for her in all,&#xD;
things. He'was busy and seemed anxious for the termination of&#xD;
the affair. His means seemed to be freely offered to secure a ver-&#xD;
dict against the prisoner.&#xD;
The case was the first on docket, and was prosecuted vigorously.&#xD;
The counsel for the defence made a most able effort, and one&#xD;
which had a happy effect upon the jury, and thecrowd generally.&#xD;
He brought up instances of circumstantial evidence, in which&#xD;
the circumstances were even plainer (because the parties were&#xD;
known to be at enmity,) than this one, which proved false in&#xD;
time. Some men had been executed upon such evidence, and the&#xD;
real murderer been found out years afterwards. He had just set-&#xD;
tled a case for a friend which, though it did not involve the life&#xD;
of any person, yet the happiness of two persons was well-nigh'&#xD;
wrecked upon circumstantial evidence.&#xD;

"A young friend of mine was betrothed to a lady every way&#xD;
worthy of him, and preparations were going forward for a wed-&#xD;
ding, five years ago. The lady resided in the country some dis-&#xD;
tance from the city of R--, where he lived. She went with&#xD;
"ome friends to the city to make some purchases for her bridal,&#xD;
and he met her at the river-packet on which she had travelled.&#xD;
Just as he handed her into the hack and was about to get in him-&#xD;
self, he was accosted, and, turning to see who spoke, recognised a&#xD;
friend from the South who was passing him hurriedly with his&#xD;
left glove off. His eye caught sight of a ring on his finger which&#xD;
caused him to tell the driver to wait a minute, and he soon over-&#xD;
took and shook hands with his friend. The gentleman was in a&#xD;
great hurry, but stopped a minute to exchange greetings. 'That&#xD;
is a beautiful, but very uncommon ring you have on,' said my&#xD;
friend. 'Yes,' he replied, 'a lady gave it to me last night, on&#xD;
the packet.' Just then he was called off and was not seen again.&#xD;
My friend returned to the hack and rode in silence to the hotel.&#xD;
When he reached thehotel he asked her if she knew the gen-&#xD;
tleman who accosted him. She replied that she did not. He&#xD;
drew her glove from her hand and said: 'It is very strange that&#xD;
you should give your ring to a perfect stranger.' 'I did not&#xD;
give my ring to any one. Indeed I did not. I lost it last night.&#xD;
I intended to tell you of it. It has made me miserable all the&#xD;
morning. I dreamed, last night, that you were angry with me&#xD;
and demanded the ring - that I returned it to you. When I&#xD;
awoke this morning I was thankful 'twas only a dream; but&#xD;
when I looked, behold, the ring was gone! The cabin was&#xD;
thoroughly searched, and I offered to reward the maid hand-&#xD;
somely if she found it for me. You, surely, cannot believe I&#xD;
would give your ring away ? It is the last thing I would part&#xD;
with,' and she burst into tears. He believed she did not speak&#xD;
the truth, and felt no pity for her. 'Trifles light as air are, to&#xD;
the jealous, confirmation strong as proofs of holy writ.' He was&#xD;
naturally suspicious, and could not be persuaded that she told the&#xD;
truth. They parted to meet no more for years; each feeling too&#xD;
deeply wronged to seek a reconciliation, and both as miserable as&#xD;
they could well be. Nine months ago I met with a party at a&#xD;
hotel in our city, en route for the springs. They were from a&#xD;

Southern State. The lady sat at my right band at the table, and&#xD;
I observed her hand, which was a very beautiful one, but its,&#xD;
chief attraction in my eyes'was a singularly shaped ring on her first&#xD;
finger. It was just the pattern of the one my friend's betrothed&#xD;
had so strangely lost. I had never seen another like it. When&#xD;
we arose from the table I asked the gentknan if I might speak&#xD;
with him a moment. He, very politely, bowed and accompanied&#xD;
me to my room. 1 apologised for addressing a stranger, and at&#xD;
once told him my friend's sad story, and ended by telling him the&#xD;
ring his wife wore on her first finger was the exact counterpart&#xD;
of the missing one. He laughed and said:  'It is a strange&#xD;
story I have to tell you, sir - one which I have hitherto refrained&#xD;
from telling lest it should be discredited. The ring may belong&#xD;
to your friend. Is Mr. George Hancock that friend?' I bowed,&#xD;
and he continued, 'I judged so from the fact that he observed it&#xD;
on my finger, and made some remarks about its being an un-&#xD;
common one on the morning after I became tile possessor of it.&#xD;
I would have told him all about it, but was i a hurry. I was&#xD;
married that morning, and left the State three hours after I met&#xD;
him. Had I foreseen the consequences of my silence I should&#xD;
have told him at any sacrifice. You know how the' packet boats&#xD;
on the      river are constructed,'I suppose, and how the pas-&#xD;
sengers sleep. Nothing but a'curtain divides the ladies' apart-'&#xD;
ment from that of the gentlemen. On the night of September&#xD;
18th, nearly five years ago, I slept on the boat with, my head&#xD;
almost touching that of a lady. I did not. know or care who or&#xD;
what she was. 'During the night she was very restless, seemed to&#xD;
be suffering from troubled dreams - tossed her arms about, and&#xD;
moaned several times. At length she began to talk rapidly, then&#xD;
her hand thrust through an opening in the curtain and rested on&#xD;
one of mine which was thrown over my head. She drew a ring&#xD;
from her finger -and slipped it on mine, all the while muttering&#xD;
something about~the ring. When she had done this she lay quietly&#xD;
and I heard no more from her. I did not know what ,to do with&#xD;
it. If I had told of the circumstances to any one it would have&#xD;
made her feel badly. I did not know who.gave it to me, and&#xD;
thought it best not to say anything about it, but kept it in a con-&#xD;
spicuous. position during the hurry of leaving the boat. You&#xD;

know we get off very early. I heard nothing said about a missing&#xD;
ring. I gave it to my wife. She will be glad to restore -it to its&#xD;
owner, with our best wishes for the future happiness of your&#xD;
friends. Â°I hope the future may be so bright as to make amends&#xD;
for the five years of trouble caused by the missing ring.&#xD;
" I took the ring to my friend and told the story as 'twas told&#xD;
to me. He was the happiest man I ever saw. 'It was not the&#xD;
ring,' he said, 'but my Lelia's happiness which my cruel jeal-&#xD;
ousy has wrecked.'                                     I&#xD;
S5}I saw them married six months ago, and a happier couple I&#xD;
s =y     never knew. Had I not met that party by mere accident, they&#xD;
would have been miserable for life. Upon what a slender thread&#xD;
hangs human happiness - ay, the very life of man ! "&#xD;
The prisoner's noble bearing, his unblemished reputation, his&#xD;
kindness of heart, his unselfish affection for his friend whom he&#xD;
was accused of murdering, were feelingly dwelt upon. When the&#xD;
case was given to the jury with the injunction, "if there is a&#xD;
doubt, let the prisoner have the benefit of it," he leaned forward&#xD;
eagerly, with blanched cheeks and clenched hands. In a few&#xD;
minutes the jury returned, saying they could not agree on a ver-&#xD;
dict; one was for hanging, some for imprisonment for the longest&#xD;
term, and a few for release. Nothing could make them agree,&#xD;
and as another jury could not be found then, the case was post-&#xD;
poned until the fall term of court. The prisoner fainted as he was&#xD;
ordered back, to jail; and Ethel was borne, weeping bitterly, to&#xD;
her desolate home.&#xD;
"They mean to wear my life out in this horrid place. They&#xD;
know I am innocent, and wish to torture me to death," were the&#xD;
impatient words of the prisoner. Mr. Mason tried to persuade&#xD;
him that Providence was working for some good, but he could see&#xD;
nothing but the enmity of man in it all. He had written to Isabel&#xD;
King twice, and begged her, by the memory of the.past, to return&#xD;
and do him' justice, for- she knew that he was innocent - she&#xD;
knew her brother vas insane. He did not receive any reply, and&#xD;
naturally supposed that she, too, was embittered against him -&#xD;
her mind had been poisoned.&#xD;

CIRCU3ISTANTIAL EVIDENCE.&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
"All's well that ends well, yet;&#xD;
Though time seem so adverse, and means unfit."--Shakspeare.&#xD;
&#xD;
Our hero worried through another six months, and another&#xD;
time for trial had colme. The case was called. Everything was&#xD;
in readiness. Mr. Roberts gave in his testimony with distinct-&#xD;
ness, and in such a way as to imply more than he said--though he&#xD;
said enough to leave no doubt upon the minds of the jury as to.&#xD;
the guilt of the prisoner.  The counsel for the defence declined&#xD;
to address the court, but' simply wished to introduce a very'im-&#xD;
portant witness. Then motioning to Dr. Hall, he took his seat.&#xD;
The old doctor retired for a moment and returned with a lady,&#xD;
closely veiled, upon his arm. When'she reached the witness.&#xD;
stand she threw back her veil, and turned her eyes full upon Mr.&#xD;
Roberts, who cowered before her gaze ; then turning to the&#xD;
prisoner, she fell upon her knees before him and cried : "Poor&#xD;
Arthur ! how you have suffered !" and she bowed her proud head,&#xD;
while her whole frame shook with convulsive sobs. He started&#xD;
violently, then dropping his head on her shoulder, said, " I did&#xD;
not kill your brother, dear Bell. God knows I did not, I loved&#xD;
him even as you did." She arose and said, " I know it, Arthur;&#xD;
and I know too that you have been deeply wronged. I come to-&#xD;
right the wrong." She turned her splendid eyes upon the Judge&#xD;
and lawyers, as she said, "I come, my friends, to do an act of&#xD;
justice. I am ignorant of the forms of law. Let ine tell my&#xD;
story in my own way. I have been an unobserved listener to&#xD;
Mr. Roberts' testimony; also to Dr. Marshall's statement.i He-&#xD;
has told you the whole truth. I did send for him the day he&#xD;
mentioned to try to find out the nature of my poor brother's&#xD;
malady. His reception by my brother was just what he stated.&#xD;
I knew that Henry loved Ethel Lee, and had addressed her and&#xD;
been rejected, previous to her engagement with Dr. Marshall. I.&#xD;
am surprised to hear the rumors afloat respecting her. She is&#xD;
above reproach, as pure as an angel, and I would have preferred&#xD;
her above all others as my brother's wife. I do not blame her for&#xD;
rejecting him, as she loved another.. It only goes to prove her&#xD;
true nobility of soul that she was not guided by mercenary&#xD;

motives. I saw that my brother felt her rejection keenly, as he&#xD;
loved her truly ; still he tried to be cheerful. He kept up an ap-&#xD;
pearance of resignation until a week before the time appointed&#xD;
for the marriage., Then he became irritable and moody, at times&#xD;
boisterously gay. We were to act as attendants, and I mentioned&#xD;
the fact to him. He started wildly, then said, with a strange&#xD;
light in his .eye: 'No, no. I can't do that. I would prefer her&#xD;
choosing Arthur to any one else, but I can't see her married. Oh,&#xD;
Bell! I wish I was dead.' I tried to reason with him, and thought&#xD;
I had succeeded in quieting his feelings. He retired, and the next&#xD;
day was confined to his room with a nervous headache. During&#xD;
the afternoon his symptoms became rather alarming, and I sent&#xD;
for Dr. Marshall. Perhaps I did wrong in sending for him, but he&#xD;
had always seemed glad to see. him-had shown no unkind&#xD;
feelings toward him. My father was Arthur's guardian, and we&#xD;
were raised together like one family. Arthur's appearance in his&#xD;
room set him to raving. He left, and I sent for Mr. Roberts, our&#xD;
nearest neighbor, to stay with my brother and watch him during&#xD;
the night. I felt an unusual fear of being alone with the servants.&#xD;
Henry continued to rave until about nine o'clock, when he became&#xD;
quiet, and we thought him asleep. I saw very plainly that he&#xD;
was insane, but hoped it would wear 'off, without exposure to the&#xD;
neighborhood. I walked out on the porch, Mr. Roberts followed&#xD;
me. Ie had made me an offer of his hand once and been re&#xD;
jected, .My brother did not like him, though he did not particu-&#xD;
larly dislike him. When he followed me that night, I was stand-&#xD;
ing in the moonlight very sad. He renewed his offer, and told&#xD;
me I needed a protector. He had never thought of addressing&#xD;
any other lady since his wife died;- and thought my brother's&#xD;
situation, his insanity, would prevent my doing better, as people&#xD;
might think us enough alike to believe I would become insane&#xD;
also. His audacity and coarseness angered me, and I told him I&#xD;
sent for .him to attend my sick brother, not to jnsult me. He&#xD;
begged pardon, and returned to my brother's room. I went to&#xD;
the door and found my brother asleep. Mr. Roberts told me I&#xD;
had better retire; if anything was needed he would have me&#xD;
awakened. I retired to my room, but could not sleep. I did not&#xD;
undress. I felt too restless. About ten o'clock I went to my&#xD;

brother's door, and heard him talking about Ethel Lee. I heard&#xD;
Mr. llberts say ,t him, 'I would not let that pale doctor cut me&#xD;
out so. No doubt he did all he could to keep her from liking&#xD;
you.' I tapped at the door, and Mr. Roberts opened it. I said&#xD;
to him,'For pity's sake try to soothe Henry to sleep; don't ex-&#xD;
cite him." I then went to him and asked him if his head was&#xD;
easier. He put his arm around my neck and said: 'Do you love&#xD;
me, Bell; would it grieve you much if I were to die?' I kissed&#xD;
him, and replied, 'Don't talk about dying, brother; you will soon&#xD;
be well-then we will take that long talked of trip to visit our rela-&#xD;
tions in Europe. You know I love you better than any one in&#xD;
the world; go to sleep now, and you will be better to-morrow.'&#xD;
' To-morrow!I' he cried, 'yes, to-morrow ! It is her wedding.&#xD;
day.' He sank back on his pillow with a moan; then he said:&#xD;
'Kiss me once more, dear sister; kiss me, and good-night. I gm&#xD;
going to sleep.' I kissed him again. He held me tightly to his&#xD;
breast a minute, then released me, and said: 'Go to bed now.'&#xD;
I went out on the porch, and stood there a while. I returned to&#xD;
his door and found all quiet; then I retired, and was soon in a&#xD;
troubled sleep, from which I was awakened about twelve o'clock.&#xD;
by Mr. Roberts running in to the house and calling to me that my&#xD;
brother had killed himself down at the river. I went out in the&#xD;
hall and asked where he was. He replied: 'At the river ; Arthur&#xD;
is with him. I want help to bring the body'home. I saw him&#xD;
stab himself. Arthur was going home 'from Mrs. Lee's and rode&#xD;
up near the bluff, when he heard Henry groan and got down from&#xD;
his horse and went to him. He got to him just before I did. He&#xD;
was dead when Arthur drew the knife out of his body.' Arthur&#xD;
has told you the balance of that fearful night; how I fainted at&#xD;
the sight of the body. Mr. Roberts has told it that I knew&#xD;
Arthur was guilty, and went away leaving my business..in his&#xD;
hands, with the request that no money should be spared in the&#xD;
prosecution. I was very ill for several weeks-delirious nearly&#xD;
all the time. I was surprised to find that Dr. Hall wasnot per-&#xD;
mitted to see me, but one from a distant county was in attend-.&#xD;
ance. No one was admitted to my room but servants and this&#xD;
strange doctor, when it was given out that I had left for Europe.&#xD;
I did go to Europe, but not until Mr. Robert told me that&#xD;

Arthur had been examined and released, that he had called to see&#xD;
me several times, and would be married soon, that the marriage&#xD;
was postponed for a few weeks on account of the death of my&#xD;
brother. He seemed so very kind and considerate I almost for-&#xD;
gave him for his rudeness. Then I was as helpless as an infant, so&#xD;
I let him make all necessary arrangements, and I was put into a&#xD;
carriage on a bed, before I could sit up, and taken to the steamer.&#xD;
I was too ill to mix with the passengers, and kept my state-room&#xD;
all the way to New York. He hired a white woman in Charles-&#xD;
ton to accompany me to New York and attend me while there.&#xD;
I gained my strength rapidly, and in a week was, on board a&#xD;
vessel bound for Liverpool. I reached there safely, and met my&#xD;
relations, with whom I have been staying since that time. I&#xD;
wrote several times to Arthur, asking him to attend to my affairs,&#xD;
but received no answer. I wrote to Ethel, also enclosing a letter&#xD;
for Arthur. I wrote to Arthur.from New York, and sent him a&#xD;
check for five thousand dollars as a bridal present. I have heard&#xD;
that he received nothing, and has written to me several times. I&#xD;
received no letter from America except 'from Mr. Roberts. He&#xD;
always mentioned Ethel and Arthur. I never -dreamed that he&#xD;
was in prison at all, or I should never have left America. By&#xD;
mere accident I picked up an American paper in London, and&#xD;
saw the whole proceedings of the great murder trial, with Mr.&#xD;
Roberts' testimonyin full. I started home immediately, and met&#xD;
-Mr. Armstrong, Arthur's counsel, in Charleston. I can't imagine&#xD;
why Mr. Roberts should have acted as he has done, unless it be&#xD;
for gain. I told him I intended to transfer my brother's interest&#xD;
in my father's estate to Arthur, as I was just of age. I knewmy&#xD;
father intended to give him something in his will, but died sud-&#xD;
denly. My brother and I had ofte      oken of. it, and were&#xD;
waiting for my majority, when I could make a right to, a portion&#xD;
of my part. If he thought he could win my affections by such&#xD;
duplicity, he is mistaken. It is very evident that he has sought to&#xD;
ruin Dr. Marshall, even to take his life. Arthur is as much my&#xD;
brother, except the blood, as Henry was, and I love him as such.&#xD;
You do. not blame your sister Bell now, do you, Arthur ?"&#xD;
Arthur arose and clasped her in his arms, while such a shout as&#xD;
had never been heard went up from that court-room. Order was&#xD;

after a while restored, when it was found that Mr. goberts, taking&#xD;
advantage of the confusion, had slipped out, unperceived, and&#xD;
could not be found. The jury returned a verdict of " not guilty '&#xD;
without quitting their seats. The last that was heard of Mr.&#xD;
Roberts he was seen by some one on. board a vessel bound to the&#xD;
East Indies. His estate was sold and hit children taken by some&#xD;
relative in a distant State.&#xD;
I need nottell of Ethel's happiness, it was too pure and deep&#xD;
for description, when Isabel folded her in her arms and said :" I&#xD;
did not know until to-day how deeply you have suffered. God&#xD;
bless you, dear Ethie, you are a t ue, noble woman, and will make&#xD;
Arthur a good wife. You cannot know how happy I am n1in&#xD;
giving him to you."&#xD;
A week later there was a quiet wedding in the little cottage&#xD;
parlor, when Mr. Armstrong and Isabel King were the only at-&#xD;
tendants, except Mr. Mason and family and Dr. Hall. Isabel had&#xD;
the papers all prepared, in which she deeded half of her estate to&#xD;
Arthur Marshall. He refused to accept it. "I have your confi-&#xD;
dence and affection, sweet sister, which is worth more than money."&#xD;
He could not prevent her from placing twenty thousand dollars&#xD;
in bank subject to his order. Isabel made Arthur's home hers for&#xD;
a few months, when Mr. Armstrong, the talented young lawyer,&#xD;
took her to his city home, where she reigns as queen over his&#xD;
splendid establishment. Her beauty and goodness make her many&#xD;
friends, but none more loving than the little family at the Cottage.&#xD;
Did Dr. Marshall feel as kindly disposed toward his fellow-men&#xD;
as before his incarceration ? The reader cannot blame him if the&#xD;
bitterness of spirit lasted months, and the demon of distrust was&#xD;
only exorcised by the two angels of his household. Some who&#xD;
had professed great friendship were the first to believe him guilty;&#xD;
then when the great reaction took place, could he feel perfect con-&#xD;
fidence in their professions of sympathy ?&#xD;

" The events of our war were too horrible to admit of such a&#xD;
tender sentiment as love. There was too much of dreadful reality&#xD;
to- make room for romance."--New York Paper.&#xD;
No romance in such a war as ours, did you say? With due&#xD;
deference for the opinions of one so much wiser than I, I beg&#xD;
leave to differ with you. Pity, though not love, is very nearly al-&#xD;
lied with that holiest of all'passions: and when pity for the suf-&#xD;
ferings, and admiration for the deeds of valor of our soldiers are&#xD;
combined, the feeling amounts to a worship almost. A sentiment&#xD;
perfectly irresistible: hence you see such frequent illustrations of&#xD;
the truth of the adage, that " none but the brave deserve the fair."&#xD;
While some of our maidens were content to make happy the poor&#xD;
exempts, a larger proportion have given their hands and hearts to&#xD;
bold soldier boys. Let all skeptics read my plain, unvarnished&#xD;
story. They will agree with me that the four years of horrible&#xD;
war contained, or developed, more plots for romance than could&#xD;
have been known in forty years of peace. 0 yes, I can prove to&#xD;
you that Southern chivalry is not dead yet. If any Southerners&#xD;
from other States should chance to read my simple story, I hope&#xD;
they will not take umbrage at my caption. Believe me, it is not&#xD;
from lack of obligation to you or admiration of your deeds that I&#xD;
select South Carolina from among the number, but from the fact&#xD;
that this is not all fiction, for my hero is no myth, but a veritable&#xD;
soldier from the Palmetto State.&#xD;
we honor, yes honor, old South Carolina&#xD;
Though small she nry be, she's as brave as the best.&#xD;

And we honor Hampton's cavalry, who did such noble service&#xD;
in our Old Dominion. From that intrepid band we select a&#xD;
youthful Lieutenant as our hero.&#xD;
To make my story intelligible, I must go back to the spring of&#xD;
1863. The facts I here narrate are well known to every citizen.&#xD;
between Chancellorsville and the South Side Railroad. Soon&#xD;
after, or rather immediately succeeding that memorable battle in&#xD;
which our country lost her noble Jackson, while public excitement&#xD;
was at its highest, the citizens of the counties between the points&#xD;
mentioned above were surprised and incensed at, the appearance&#xD;
of a large body of cavalry. Stoneman and his inhuman Dutch.-&#xD;
men, " the brute made ruler and the man made brute," attempted&#xD;
to make their way across the country in order to cut off commu-&#xD;
nication with Richmond. Their plan was, I believe, to tear up&#xD;
the aqueducts at Columbia across the Rivanna, and at Byrd Creek,&#xD;
on the James River Canal, but they failed to accomplish anything&#xD;
more than a destruction of private property, which they had very&#xD;
little inclination to respect. So after robbing hen-roosts, fright-&#xD;
ening women and children, and stealing negro clothing, &amp;amp;c., feel-&#xD;
ing a mortal fear of Stuart's cavalry, they decamped, leaving be-&#xD;
hind them, in the hearts of the wives and daughters, sisters and&#xD;
sweethearts of Confederate soldiers, a hatred lasting as life and&#xD;
strong as death.&#xD;
Our government, fearful that they might be sufficiently cour-&#xD;
ageous to cross the river and attempt the destruction of the High&#xD;
Bridge on the South Side road, sent troops up the south side of&#xD;
the river to intercept them.&#xD;

pleasure as well as of relief to the ladies of that place and its vi-&#xD;

came to protect them against the Yankees, whose expected advent&#xD;

returned and took their brides to the bright sunny South, ere the&#xD;
close of the war. Some waited till the war was over, while some&#xD;
in whose cases was verified the saying, " Out of sight, out of&#xD;

Tut these were rare cases. There were firm friendships formed&#xD;
which time and the chances of war have only served to strengthen,&#xD;
and delightful interchange of thoughts and sentiments with some&#xD;
whose names go to make up the long list of martyrs for freedom's&#xD;
cause. Their names live in our hearts, and will live on the&#xD;
bloodiest page of history. With Ossian, we say to our pppressors&#xD;
"Thou lookest from thy towers to-day ; yet a few years, and the&#xD;
blast of the desert comes ; it howls in thy empty court, and&#xD;
whistles round thy half-worn shield. And let the blast of the&#xD;

A lady, the wonder of her kind,&#xD;
whose form was upborne by a lovely mind&#xD;
Which, dilating, had moulded her mien and motion&#xD;
Like a sea-flower unfolded beneath the ocean.&#xD;
"I doubt not the flowers of that garden sweet&#xD;
Rejoiced in the sound of her gentle feet;&#xD;
I doubt not they felt thespirit that came-&#xD;
From her glowing fingers through all their frame."&#xD;
This maiden was Ella Morrison-a modest, retiring girl of&#xD;
se\renteen; the pet of her father, who cherished her as the last&#xD;
link which bound him to life; a fair, fragile creature, delicate, yet&#xD;
lithe and graceful in her. figure. That frail form enshrined a&#xD;
spirit superior to that of many more hardy-looking damsels, and&#xD;
that small but finely shaped head was. a  casket containing a&#xD;
jewel of rare value. Her mind was richly stored with wisdom.&#xD;
Mr. Morrison was a finely educated man, and instructed his&#xD;
daughter as he would have done his son, the shock of whose early&#xD;
death he had never entirely recovered from. In his daughter's&#xD;
tuitio n he hid not forgotten those lighter accomplishments which&#xD;
so much adorn a lady -,music, drawing, &amp;amp;c., in which she had&#xD;
efficient teachers. A dear lover of poetry and the ideal, his daugh-&#xD;
ter, while inheriting from him this passion, had his example to&#xD;
guide her in he r choice of reading matter. They lived in a little&#xD;
world of their own.    To them    their library was " dukedom&#xD;
large enough."   Mr. Miorrison had once been wealthy, but bad&#xD;
health, together with family afflictions, crippled his energies,&#xD;

never held with a niggard hand. He found that he could not&#xD;
keep up appearances as a man of wealth, so he sold out every-&#xD;
thing except a small farm, on which he had a neat cottage built,&#xD;
and spent his time in the pursuits of agriculture. His wife had&#xD;
died when Ella was only fourteen,.leaving her tender floweret to&#xD;
his care, well knowing that he was as well qualified for the task&#xD;
as any man could be.&#xD;
He determined to try to build up her constitution as well as&#xD;
form her mind. Therefore, lhe encouraged her to ride on horse-&#xD;
back until she became the best equestrian in the neighborhood;-&#xD;
and he was amply satisfied with the roses planted in her cheeks&#xD;
after "brushing the dew from the upland lawn."    He took her&#xD;

into the garden and required her assistance in setting plants or&#xD;
dropping seeds, .by which means she soon became able to super-&#xD;
intend the planting as well as the cooking of vegetables; and,&#xD;
while aiding in the preservation of her health, she was becoming&#xD;
a notable housewife. Her father's constant companion, it had&#xD;
never entered into his head that she needed other society than his&#xD;
and that of her cousin, Nora Stanhope, a gay young lady of nine-&#xD;
teen, who had shared the advantages of Ella's education, with the&#xD;
addition of two years at a fashionable boarding school, from which&#xD;
she had returned not spoiled, but a little giddy and very wilful,&#xD;
perhaps not a little vain, from the score of compliments she was&#xD;
constantly receiving from as many young men.&#xD;
Living as Ella did, among her books and flowers, caring{ little&#xD;
for other sources of amusement, receiving but few visitors', it is&#xD;
not strange that she saw none of the soldiers camped near her.&#xD;
While many delicacies, as well as necessaries, found their way&#xD;
from her house to the camp, none of the soldiers found the way&#xD;
to her retired domicil; and they came and went in total ignorance&#xD;
of the gentle floweret blooming in the adjacent forest. I know&#xD;
my readers will think I am getting this young lady into a situa-&#xD;
tion where she will never be known, and I think I hear some&#xD;
novel-reading Miss exclaim: "What do you want with her? I&#xD;
thought you were going to make her meet, by mere accident, one&#xD;
of those Southern soldiers, and have a nice story of love at first&#xD;
sight, an intuitive knowledge of congeniality which would lead to&#xD;
confessions of love."' To all such I say wait awhile and you will&#xD;
see that "the race is not always to the swift."&#xD;
.I must here necessarily make a long leap in my narrative&#xD;
from May' 1863 to January 1864 -at which time a letter was.&#xD;
sent to Ella Morrison from the postmaster at .., with a mes-&#xD;
sage to the effect that it had lain -in the office.at that place for&#xD;
nearly eight months, and failing to find an owner, and knowing&#xD;
of no one who was connected with the Purcell family except her-&#xD;
self, had taken the liberty to send it to her. She very readily sur-&#xD;
mised from the post-mark that it was from a soldier who had evi-&#xD;
dently been mistaken in some one's name, or been wilfully led&#xD;
astray. Inquiries were made in the neighborhood for some time,&#xD;
and no one coming forward and proving property, she .consulted&#xD;

her father, who told her there could be no impropriety in opening&#xD;
the letter, as by so doingshe might -possibly find out for whom it&#xD;
was intended. She opened it, and read as follows:&#xD;
Miss Jane PurceU:-Although the cloud of war darkens our&#xD;
once fair Southern sky, and, gentle peace and innocence have given&#xD;
place to cruel strife and unjust oppression, we are.often reminded&#xD;
of those dear tender ties which bind us to life, and without which&#xD;
civilisation and refinement would be wanting in the land. Hav-&#xD;
ing once seen you, it is utterly impossible for jne to forget you;&#xD;
and I venture to write you with the hope that if you think our&#xD;
very short acquaintance will not warrant a correspondence, you&#xD;
will, at least, pardon my presumption, and&#xD;
"Though victorious in the field,&#xD;
Thy captives do not spurn.&#xD;
"The brave, poor soldier ne'er despise,&#xD;
Nor count him as a stranger ;&#xD;
Remember, he's your country's stay&#xD;
In day and hour of danger."&#xD;
Hoping -if even hope be madness - that this experiment&#xD;
may meet with a response, I am,&#xD;
Your devoted servant,&#xD;
JAMES MORTON,&#xD;
Co, -, 1st S. C. Cavalry, Hampton's Brigade.&#xD;
Ella thought over the letter for a few days, and caine to the&#xD;
conclusion that as no one could be found by that name, it would&#xD;
be a pity for the poor fellow to losehis labor, and saw no reason&#xD;
why she might not take the name for a short time. She had&#xD;
never seen him, and in all probability never would, and she&#xD;
thought such a correspondence would serve to amuse her, and&#xD;
might instruct her in army movements; .besides by encouraging&#xD;
him to write again, she might find out who Jane Purcell really&#xD;
was; therefore, she ventured on the following response:&#xD;
Mr. Aforton :-Your very unexpected letter of the 3d June&#xD;
came to hand on the 5th instant. Words are powerless to express&#xD;
my chagrin at its unaccountable delay, and I find myself at a loss&#xD;
to form a suitable response after such a lapse of time. I do not&#xD;

so much as know that you are living at this time, or, if living,&#xD;
where you may be. I write at a venture. There has been hard&#xD;
fighting since you were in this county, and you may have retired&#xD;
to your far Southern home, leaving an amputated limb in the Old&#xD;
Dominion. Having heard so many names, I hope you will pardon&#xD;
me if I fail to remember your personal appearance. If you&#xD;
should consider it worth your while to write again, I would be&#xD;
pleased to have a description of yourself, so as to quicken my&#xD;
memory. As I am not sure you will get this, I will not write at&#xD;
length this time, but promise something better for the future.&#xD;

Thus' was begun a correspondence which increased in interest&#xD;
for several months. Any scruples which Ella might have had&#xD;
gradually disappeared, until she found herself looking for the&#xD;
coming of the mails with intense interest, .and responding to the&#xD;
letters with as much pleasure as if she knew her unknown corres-&#xD;
pondent personally, perhaps more so; and as though she. were&#xD;
really what she assumed to be. No one was permitted to enter&#xD;
into this cherished secret. Thus was she going on, blindly, until&#xD;
a letter came to her bearing the name, but entirely different in&#xD;
style, orthography, penmanship ; everything as different as could&#xD;
be, in which Mr. Morton made her an offer of his hand and for-&#xD;
tune, and saying he "had no objections to an exchange 6f&#xD;
ambrotypes.&#xD;
Forgetting that she had, by thus writing to an entire stranger,&#xD;
taking the place of another, laid herself liable to receive anything&#xD;
he chose to write to her, and following the dictates of her own&#xD;
outraged feelings, she wrote a few hurried lines, stating that when&#xD;
she began the-correspondence, she. did so under the conviction&#xD;
that he was a gentleman and a scholar whose letters would afford&#xD;
her amusement as well as instruction. Since she had found out&#xD;
that he was neither the one nor the other, she hoped he would not&#xD;
trouble her with any more communications from his pen ; and en-&#xD;
closed his letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
Very respectfully,&#xD;

CHAPTER III.&#xD;
A fate attends on all I write."--Pope.&#xD;
In vain did Ella essay to forget her vexation at the reception&#xD;
of Mr. Morton's last letter. The thought; that she had but paved&#xD;
the way was galling to her modesty, and she resolved to write to&#xD;
no one again without her father's knowledge and sanction. She&#xD;
had but one source of consolation, which was the fact that her&#xD;
name was not known in, the affair, no one in the neighborhood&#xD;
knowing anything about-it except the postmaster, who was an old&#xD;
and trusty friend. ' We will see how her resolution was kept.&#xD;
Ten days after her letter was written she received the following&#xD;
letter, written in the style of former letters-at least the same&#xD;
handwriting:&#xD;
CAMP OF 1ST S. C. CAVALRY,&#xD;
Near Columbia, S. C.&#xD;
iss Purcell:-'I scarcely know how to commence this feeble&#xD;
epistle. If I did not, deem my past ungallant conduct demanded'&#xD;
an explanation, I would certainly give up in despair. I think I&#xD;
cannot do better than by using the following egotistic style.&#xD;
Mr. Morton came to me in the spring of 1863, and asked me to&#xD;
write a letter for him, and you may know I readily acquiesced&#xD;
when he promised to let me see the answer, if any ever came.&#xD;
When your reply was received, it threw me into raptures of de-.&#xD;
light. I corresponded with some ladies in Virginia, but yours,&#xD;
in Morton's name, gave me more pleasure than all the rest, and I&#xD;
often wished I could sign my own name instead of his. I was&#xD;
absent on duty when he wrote his unfortunate letter. He is very&#xD;
miserable, and insists on my writing you in. his name, but I have&#xD;
declined positively, and have registered a vow never to be guilty,&#xD;
of such ungallant conduct again. He is a perfect child of nature.&#xD;
I would have hailed such a rupture in the correspondence with&#xD;
delight, had I remained in Virginia ; but as I have left that noble&#xD;
old State, I feel myself beyond all hope of redemption. I have&#xD;
hitherto been able to compare my heart to a rock in the (ocean,&#xD;
against which the breakers continually dash without making any&#xD;
im pression. ,I must admit that this last surge of the fickle god-&#xD;

&#xD;
dess' ill-favored wave has made it to totter in its firm foundation,&#xD;
though it is no more than was deserved by a young outlaw from&#xD;
the Military Institute of this State, from whose time-honored&#xD;
walls I was expelled in 1861 to join the army, against the Wishes&#xD;
of my kind old father. For thus disgracing myself, and being a&#xD;
good, easy somebody, after the Pennsylvania campaign of last&#xD;
year, my comrades were whimsical enough to confer on me the&#xD;
rack of senior second lieutenant, and you know the weight of&#xD;
such heavy honors! was more than sufficient to turn the head of a&#xD;
young jackanapes like.myself, not then out of my teens. There-&#xD;
fore, I pray you, throw the veil of charity over my unknightly&#xD;
conduct. I am a pauvre oyster-fed cavalryman, and not worthy&#xD;
of your anger or contempt. May God bless you and make you&#xD;
happy, is the-earnest wish of      ROBERT G. WILLIAMsÂ°.&#xD;
When this letter was received Ella was both astonished and&#xD;
pleased. Here was romance. The only difficulty was, how could&#xD;
it be continued ? She thought over it for two days, and all her&#xD;
resolutions never to write to another stranger vanished before her&#xD;
love of adventure. Still she could not think of signing her own&#xD;
name. Therefore she went with all her difficulties to her cousin&#xD;
Nora Stanhope, to whom she told the whole story, and how much&#xD;
she wished to continue the correspondence, yet shrunk from&#xD;
giving her true name, while she felt it would not be right to con-&#xD;
tinue the name of Janie Purcell. Nora was in raptures. She&#xD;
read all of the letters, and declared them splendid. She had sev-&#xD;
eral soldier correspondents, but nothing in her experience could&#xD;
equal this. She had been reading Macaria, which had just come&#xD;
out, and made her head ache over Irene's scientific words. They&#xD;
were regular brain-splitting jaw-crackers, and she was delighted&#xD;
to find something to divert her thoughts from such self-sacrificug&#xD;
heroines, and gave her full and fire consent for her name to be&#xD;
used, always provided she was to -know how it was carried on,&#xD;
and be first bridesmaid in ase anything serious ever came of it.&#xD;
"Ali! Mabelle cousin," she said, " I have imagined you a heroine&#xD;
after the Irene and Beulah order, but am really pleased to find&#xD;
you flesh and blood, after 'all. '.A fellow-feeling makes us won-&#xD;
drous kind,' and I am glad to find that' your heart is not stone,&#xD;

&#xD;
and you have a little of woman's peculiar prerogative, curiosity. I&#xD;
detest these model women, or rather monstrosities, such as Miss&#xD;
Evans makes of her heroines. God never made a woman such as&#xD;
Irene. You know I dislike a sniveller an croaker, still I would&#xD;
prefer a Niobe' all tears to a woma v1o never enjoyed that&#xD;
luxury. Why I actually shed tears -over the description of the&#xD;
death-bed scene of' only a private in the ranks,' while Irene held&#xD;
the head of her dying lover while all around were in tears, without&#xD;
so much as a moistening of her eyelids. I know what you would&#xD;
tell me, that the sorrow that cannot find v'nt in tears is deepest.&#xD;
I grant all that, still the fountains of the great deep must be&#xD;
broken up sooner or later ; human nature cannot. long bear such&#xD;
an unnatural strain pr violation of her laws."&#xD;
Ella replied that she had " no inclination to imitate Miss&#xD;
Evans' heroines. Had circumstances thrown me into society as&#xD;
much as they have you, I should id all probability have been as&#xD;
much of a flirt as you are, always provided I had': been as much&#xD;
complimented.- I hope, however, my heart would have retained&#xD;
as much of goodness as yours, and my poor giddy brain no more&#xD;
warped. You are really - a dear, good cousin, and I   dily&#xD;
prfiise you all you ask."&#xD;
Writing materials were prqduced, and the following lett r was&#xD;
written and given to Noi to have mailed:&#xD;
Lieutenant W lliams: --Truly these rebel days a "e full of&#xD;
wonders. I have heard many strange and romantic incidents of.&#xD;
the war, but I venture to affirm that few can exceed; this of our.&#xD;
correspondence. I cannot .nd it in my heart to be angry with&#xD;

During the month of January,1864, a letter was sent me by&#xD;
the postmaster at -----, directed to Miss Jane Purcell. - As he&#xD;
- said it had been there eight months, and as I had some relatives&#xD;
by the name of Purcell, he thought I might know for whom it&#xD;
was intended. I have some family connections by that name, but&#xD;
not a Jane among the number, and none of them belong to this&#xD;
county. I have tried, by inquiries among my neighbors, and no&#xD;
one seems to remember Mr. Morton. As I had been unsuccessful in&#xD;
finding out Mr. M.'s inamorata, and having no correspondent in&#xD;
the army, and being possessed of a sort of monomania known as&#xD;
cacoethes scribendit- and besides thinking, as. I still do, that some&#xD;
one had used that name to deceive Mr. Morton, I concluded to&#xD;
adopt the name, and write in answer to his letter. I knew he had&#xD;
never seen me, as I saw none of the soldiers Who came to our&#xD;
county; therefore, I hope his wounds are not mortal. I feel now&#xD;
that I did wrong in. treating him as I have done, though I only&#xD;
felt at the beginning as if it was a girlish frolic. You know how&#xD;
the affair has been carried on. I must confess that some of my&#xD;
most pleasant hours were spent in reading those letters intended&#xD;
for some one else. I hope you are not a Papist, but if you are&#xD;
and have any more sins to confess, you are at liberty to confess&#xD;
them to&#xD;
Your romantic correspondent,&#xD;

gave me much greater pleasure than if it had been expected. I&#xD;
am no Papist, but, on the contrary, a descendant of the Huguenots,&#xD;
who were driven from their " belle France " by the persecutions&#xD;
of the former. This is true, so far as history is concerned ; but I&#xD;
would count myself happy if, by turning Papist, I could have&#xD;
such a fair priestess as thou art. Willingly, gladly, would I go&#xD;
to my confession. You will probably think I am very presump-&#xD;
tive to express in such awkward terms my admiration of your&#xD;
personal charms, when I am unknown to you; bt pray excpse&#xD;
my simplicity in believing that none but a beautiful lady can be&#xD;
so generous and kind to one unknown. Providence permitting, I&#xD;
shall visit Virginia when this cruel war is over, and hope to have&#xD;
the pleasure of meeting Miss Stanhope. Now I am only a poor&#xD;
sea-coast soldier, and dare not hope for a continuance of this very&#xD;
interesting correspondence, much as I may desire it.&#xD;
We are now .to the right and front of Charleston, and receive&#xD;
occasionally a bombshell, which makes a great noise, but seldom&#xD;
does any damage. We were visited by the Yankees an person&#xD;
last Sunday, but, after a slight.skirmish, they retired. The cas-&#xD;
ualties on our side amounted to five or six. Our cavalry, as in-&#xD;
fantry, was engaged. We are acting solely as infantry--turn out&#xD;
on picket nightly. The siege is progressing, regularly, and even&#xD;
now the calm Sabbath is being interrupted by the deep-mouthed&#xD;
roar of friendly and hostile guns.&#xD;
t- I am called off, and have only time to add that I have read&#xD;
your letter over and over again, and instead of its appearing as a&#xD;
twice-told tale, I admire it more and more. Would it be asking&#xD;
too much to beg you will write again to&#xD;
Yours, with respect and admiration,&#xD;
ROBERT G WILLIAMS.&#xD;
The summer and fall of, 1864 were passed disastrously to the&#xD;
Confederate cause. Defeat after defeat followed each other in.&#xD;
quick succession. Charleston held out bravely against her be-&#xD;
siegers.' The first S. C. cavalry still acted as infantry, and all the&#xD;
fall and winter Lieutenant Williams still found time to carry on&#xD;
the correspondence with, as he supposed, Nora Stanhope. . During&#xD;
the fall he sent her his photograph. His letters had become very&#xD;

friendly and complimentary, but he was waiting for a sigh of her&#xD;
face to declare a warmer sentiment. She had promised to' return&#xD;
the compliment by forwarding her picture as soon as she had an&#xD;
opportunity to have it taken. On the 18th of February Charleston&#xD;
was evacuated by the Confederates, and occupied by Federal forces.&#xD;
All communication by mail was cut off, so that all hope of hearing&#xD;
from Lieutenant Williams was gone, and Ella gave herself up to&#xD;
her books and flowers, and her housekeeping, as before. Nora&#xD;
alone knew her secret, and she alone could sympathise with her,&#xD;
though Ella tried very hard to make even that one friend believe&#xD;
she cared nothing for him; that she only wrote to him for the&#xD;
pleasure it afforded to receive a letter from the army. Still, she&#xD;
missed those messengers of kindly feeling, and very frequently&#xD;
found herself wondering if he were alive, and if so, would he ever&#xD;
come to Virginia ?&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
" And did they return no more?" said Utha's bursting sigh. "Fell the mighty&#xD;
in battle, and did Crimora live? Her steps were lonely, hei soul was sad for&#xD;
Connal."-088 au.&#xD;
The fall of Charleston was but the prelude to that grand march&#xD;
which was anything but music to us; the general breaking up of&#xD;
our armies ; the advent among us of provost guards, Freedmen's&#xD;
Bureau, and all the host of Yankee cruelties and devices-that&#xD;
wicked time when&#xD;
"Each wanton judge new penal statutes drew."&#xD;
Those were the days that tried men's souls, and women's too;&#xD;
for, if the men had to take all sorts of nauseous doses in the shape&#xD;
of amnesty oaths, etc., the ladies had to put up with insolence&#xD;
from former servants, and in many instances had to do all their&#xD;
household work, while paying their slaves regular wages. It was&#xD;
a matter of wonder how those daughters of luxury, so tenderly&#xD;
and delicately reared, could yield so gracefully to the force of .cir-&#xD;
cumstances, thereby giving so little cause to their tyrannical con-&#xD;
querors to rejoice over our downfall, proving that whatever the&#xD;
fate of our country might be, her women were not conquered.&#xD;

While Ella and her father saw no "rebel " soldiers, they were&#xD;
not so fortunate with regard to the Yankees, and Mr. Morrison&#xD;
being an uncompromising States Rights man, he suffered 11o little-&#xD;
from their impertinence in thrusting themselves, unbidden, upon&#xD;
his privacy, at all times. Ella was very much annoyed and in-&#xD;
convenienced, and but rarely left her father's room. But all things&#xD;
must have an end, and the Yankees were withdrawn ; the negroes&#xD;
or a portion of them, went to work; the farmers did what they&#xD;
could and ,made tolerably good crops.&#xD;
The autumn passed, and winter came once more, and with it&#xD;
came a spirit of frolicking such as had not been known in that&#xD;
quiet neighborhood for many years. Ella, now nearly nineteen,&#xD;
was persuaded to go intosociety. Nora got her uncle on her side,&#xD;
and Ella niade her debut under that young lady's chaperonage,&#xD;
and soon became quite gay and very much admired. In all these&#xD;
months there was a name hidden away in her heart, though she&#xD;
had begun to think of him as dead. Now, real.suitors pressed&#xD;
forward to claim her hand, still she could not thrust out that&#xD;
pleasant memory. Was he among the slain? or did he only carry&#xD;
on that correspondence, as she had begun it, merely as a pleasant&#xD;
pastime, to be dropped when he grew weary ? and had he become&#xD;
weary and gla of an excuse to discontinue it-? were questions&#xD;
she asked herseX every day. That handsome photograph was&#xD;
often admired an sighed over, when no one saw her. But she&#xD;
was learning some worldly wisdom, and could conceal her real&#xD;
feelings so well that all who knew her thought her very light.&#xD;
hearted, and as free in thought as the birds,, while those who&#xD;
sought to win her affections came to the conclusion that she had&#xD;
no heart. Thus passed the winter. Nora Stanhope was affianced&#xD;
to a very worthy man, though the marriage would not be con-&#xD;
summated before the fall.. It was a very pleasant March afternoon.&#xD;
Nora had gone to spend the night with Ella. Soon -after her ar-&#xD;
rival, a young man, who was once rejected by Ella, made his ap-&#xD;
pearance. He had been persuaded by Nora to try again, as she&#xD;
thought her cousin might be induced to change her mind. She had&#xD;
used every art of persuasion of which.she was mistress to prevail&#xD;
on Ella to accept him, and her reply was, "I will try to like him&#xD;
for your sake.'' And she had been trying in vain for the last&#xD;

month to love him. He had come this evening for his final an-&#xD;
swer. Ella was hardly herself; she was restless and unusually&#xD;
serious, and, there. was an unnatural moisture about her long eye-&#xD;
lashes, which did not escape Nora's penetrating gaze, and she took&#xD;
an opportunity to whisper to her not to do anything she would&#xD;
regret afterwards. Nora proposed that they should walk to meet&#xD;
her brother, who had gone to the postoffice, and when they started&#xD;
she purposely fell behind with a book.&#xD;
Mr. Adams and Ella walked in silence for some time; at length&#xD;
he asked her if she had changed her mind, and was prepared to&#xD;
give him a favorable answer. She replied in a low, but firm&#xD;
tone:&#xD;
" I wish you had not asked me this. I value your friendship&#xD;
very highly, but I believe I have no heart to bestow. I have tried&#xD;
to -love you, because I esteem you very much more than any one&#xD;
else I have seen, and my friends like you, still I cannot love you&#xD;
as you deserve to be loved. Let me be your friend; but, I pray&#xD;
you, do not again ask me to be more."&#xD;
Just then Nora's brother came meeting them, and, to the query&#xD;
"Any letters? " replied :" Yes, some for sister." They retraced&#xD;
their steps, and met Nora, who was behind them. As she took&#xD;
her letters, her glance felli'on one post-marked Savannah, which&#xD;
she broke open, and finding it from Lieutenant Williams, she said,&#xD;
quietly:&#xD;
"Here, Nell, you may read this while I look at the others."&#xD;
Surprised at Nora's liberality, she took the letter, when the&#xD;
handwriting attracting her eye, she hastily glanced at the name,&#xD;
when she turned deadly pale, and caught Nora's arm for support.&#xD;
One look was sufficient to prove to Nora the state of Ella's hea t,-&#xD;
but she wisely held her tongue, and, taking her place by Mr.&#xD;
Adams' side, left Ella to read her letter. We will look over her&#xD;
shoulder, although it is a very impolite trick, and see what he has&#xD;
to say for himself. It is not long enough, to weary our patience :&#xD;
g'fiss Nora tanhope :-It has been such -a long, dull time since&#xD;
I heard from you, that I can scarce muster up courage to attempt&#xD;
to re-open a correspondence with you - a correspondence which&#xD;
was so profitable and interesting to me in the "oldreb days." I&#xD;

would have written to you long ago, but had very little hope of,&#xD;
being able to contrive a letter to your portion of Virginia. We&#xD;
have no means of communication except through .the military in&#xD;
the country, and I presume that such is the state of affairs in your&#xD;
State. however, I will venture the epistle, with the hope of again&#xD;
hearing from Miss Stanhope, and if the worst must come, even&#xD;
from Mrs.-.&#xD;
I remained true to the Confederacy until the Hillsboro, or&#xD;
Bennet House surrender, and came out of the war without having&#xD;
received any dangerous wound. When I reached home, I found&#xD;
that the Yankees had been before me, having burnt out and de-&#xD;
stroyed to the best of their ability. By this time, however, we&#xD;
have partially re-built, and enjoy comparative comfort. I have&#xD;
written the above with very little spirit, as I have but small hope&#xD;
that it will ever reach you. If it should be so fortunate, write&#xD;
soon and cheer me up. I am keeping bachelor's hall, and need&#xD;
your inspiring messenger.&#xD;
With much respect,     ROBERT G. WILLIAMS.&#xD;
The first transport of joy over, Ella began to consider the&#xD;
probability that Nora might refuse to let her name be used again,&#xD;
as she was engaged., Nora's mind was busy on the same subject,&#xD;
and she concluded, that if she could not persuade Ella to tell him&#xD;
the truth at once, she would permit her name to be used a while&#xD;
longer. She could not bear to spoil such a splendid romance, and&#xD;
she would like to see what would come of it. Her consent was&#xD;
given and Ella soon sent an answer, and the correspondence thus&#xD;
renewed, continued for several months without interruption. To&#xD;
show how our hero and heroine were progressing I will merely&#xD;
say, the formality of their first letters was discarded, and such be-&#xD;
sinnings as " Ma Chere Amie," and " My Much Esteemed Friend,"&#xD;
&amp;amp;c., substituted in their stead. I will here make a extract from&#xD;
a letter of his, the last: " Early in June, '63, merely to oblige,&#xD;
another, I wrote a letter to a lady whom I had never seen or heard&#xD;
of. It is useless to dwell on the result, how names were changed,&#xD;
and how the present time finds me pleasantly employed in writing&#xD;
to this now accomplished lady and friend. Three years have gone&#xD;
into the void of time, and our delightful.correspondence is'still&#xD;

unmarred. Is that all ? Will this romance ever 'point a moral&#xD;
or adorn a tale ?' Is there aught behind the curtain ? Let it be&#xD;
as it may, as soon as I can get one day's march ahead of poverty,&#xD;
I shall see Miss Stanhope."&#xD;
Nora's marriage was now but a month off, and she tried to&#xD;
persuade Ella to make one more confession, as she could not con-&#xD;
sent for her name to be used in such a way when she was mar-&#xD;
ried. But poor little coward, she could not tell him all lest he&#xD;
would think she was still trying to deceive him. If she could see&#xD;
him she could make him understand her motives for such de-&#xD;
ception, but she dare not hope for anything but contempt at this&#xD;
late day. She preferred breaking off the correspondence, painful&#xD;
as, it would be. Therefore, she waited until a -few days before&#xD;
Nora's marriage, then she sent him a wedding card without a&#xD;
word of explanation or regret ; thereby leaving him to think her,&#xD;
what she most detested, a heartless coquette. The wedding&#xD;
passed off gayly with one exception. Poor Ella ! she was reaping&#xD;
the reward of her cowardice.&#xD;
Acting as first bridesmaid, she naturally claimed a large share&#xD;
sof attention, and she was so purely beautiful; her pure white&#xD;
complexion rivalling the fleecy white'of he- dress. She was very&#xD;
pale, and a pensive sadness, painful to her friends, rested on her&#xD;
lovely brow.&#xD;
A schoolmate, and very dear friend of Nora's, officiated as&#xD;
second bridesmaid. To know Lizzie Irby was to love her. A.&#xD;
petite and graceful figure, a broad, white brow, mild 'blue-gray&#xD;
eyes, betokening soul as well as intellect, a small, beautifully&#xD;
shaped, mouth, whose firmly compressed lips expressed as plainly&#xD;
as lips could do decision of character, while they could wreathe&#xD;
with smiles, showing two charming dimples at the corners, to&#xD;
which add a heart full of kind feeling to every living thing, and a&#xD;
childlike innocence and joyousness, and you have her picture in&#xD;
full.&#xD;
She and Ella were irresistibly drawn toward each other, and&#xD;
during two weeks spent together they became firm friends. Lizzie&#xD;
was quite demonstrative in her - affections, and dearly loved a&#xD;
pet name. Ella was "Nellie dear " with her, as she thought&#xD;
Nellie a much softer and sweeter name than Ella. She wondered.&#xD;

what could make her dear friend so pensive, and she questioned&#xD;
Nora on the subject, who feeling bound to keep the secret, said&#xD;
she was afraid Ella was going into a decline. She felt very un-&#xD;
easy about her. Her mother had died of consumption.&#xD;
Lizzie left for home, and her affectionate letters were a source&#xD;
of real pleasure to Ella, whose cheeks were growing paler, form&#xD;
more ethereal and step slower. Her father was seriously alarmed&#xD;
at her appearance, and proposed a visit to Lizzie, as he thought a&#xD;
change might be beneficial to her health. About that time a let-&#xD;
ter came from her friend, which, as it contains a heart history, de-&#xD;
serves a separate chapter.&#xD;

",That happy mingleient of hearts&#xD;
Where, changed as chemic compounds are,&#xD;

"You doubtless remember my showing you a picture of a sol-&#xD;
dier. I very well recollect your exclamation, '0O, how noble !'-&#xD;
Will you not tire, dear Nellie, with reading the story of that pic-&#xD;
ture? Trusting to your good nature, and knowing your love for&#xD;
the romantic, I will tell you a true love story."&#xD;
During the summer of 1862 1 was in Richmond with some&#xD;
friends, who proposed visiting the hospitals. I shall never forget&#xD;
that morning, for it was then I met my " fate." I went with the.&#xD;
matron into a room in which I saw a soldier lying on his bed, so&#xD;
very pale I started back, for I thought bp was dead. The noise&#xD;
of our entrance caused him to turn his head, and} such a pair of&#xD;
eyes as met my look of compassion I have never seen elsewhere.&#xD;
There must have been something like magnetic attraction ,in our&#xD;
eyes, for neither seemed disposed to turn away. I went up to his&#xD;
bedside, and entered into conversation with him. Soon the&#xD;
matron said she must leave, as she had to visit other rooms. My'&#xD;
friends who accompanied me were making the rounds, and I&#xD;
turned to leave with the matron, when he said, in a low, weak,&#xD;
tone:&#xD;

" Please take a chair, and talk to me.. I get so lonely here."&#xD;
What could I do but comply? My sympathies were enlisted,&#xD;
and I sat by him for a half hour. In that time he told me he was&#xD;
a South Carolinian ; had lost a leg in the battles around Richmond;&#xD;
was fond of reading, but was too weak to read, and the visitors&#xD;
who came in remained but, a few minutes; had lost his Bible,&#xD;
which he missed very much. I went into the matron's room, bor-&#xD;
rowed her Bible, and read a chapter for him. He thanked me,&#xD;
and, my friends calling for me, I bade him a hearty farewell and&#xD;
left him, thinking I should never see him again. I came up to&#xD;
my home. Two weeks later a friend of mine went to Richmond,&#xD;
and I sent by him to the wounded soldier my Bible-my dead&#xD;
mother's Bible-with my name written on the fly-leaf. I had no&#xD;
other small one, and I thought it might. comfort him in his afflic-&#xD;
tion. tae sent me many thanks, and a message to the effect that&#xD;
he expected to start home soon, but would not forget his kind&#xD;
Virginia friend.&#xD;
More than a month after the Bible was sent, I visited Richmond&#xD;
again, in company with some friends., We took, the rounds of the&#xD;
hospitals, and what was my surprise to find Mr. Duval still in his&#xD;
old room, in bed. He rose on his elbow when he saw, me, and&#xD;
smiled as I approached him. He told me he had been very ill--&#xD;
near to death's door. Now, he was once more slowly recovering,&#xD;
but very feeble. I read for him, and. spent nearly an hour at his&#xD;
bedside, so very pleasantly it seemed not more than five minutes.&#xD;
When I bade him farewell, he held out his hand for a more cordial&#xD;
leave-taking. When I placed my hand in his, he carried it to his&#xD;
lips, and said I had been a ministering angel to him, and he hoped&#xD;
we should meet again. I returned home, and in a( few days left&#xD;
on a visit to some relatives up the country. My health was not&#xD;
good, and my father agreed for me to prolong my stay, and to&#xD;
visit the mountains before my return. I was absent more than a&#xD;
year. When I reached home, I found a letter from Greenville,&#xD;
South Carolina, from Samuel Duval, in which be stated to me that&#xD;
he had written to me several. times, and, having failed to hear&#xD;
from me, was afraid my name had been changed. If such was the&#xD;
case, he would, like to know it, and to know that I was well and&#xD;
happy, as he had never ceased to think of me as a dear, kind&#xD;

friend to him ia strange land. - I was pleased to hear from him,&#xD;
as the thought that he had forgotten me was not very gladdening&#xD;
to my vanity. I will not weary- you with details-enough that I-&#xD;
wrote to him, and the correspondence then begun, has continued&#xD;
ever since, with only a short interruption, occasioned by the dis-&#xD;
tracted state of our country after the surrender. For a long while&#xD;
our letters were such as any friends, might write; and, until the&#xD;
close of the war, the subject \of love was not discussed between us.&#xD;
Since that time he has made a formal declaration of his love, and&#xD;
an offer of his hand. You, with your strict ideas of propriety,&#xD;
think we ought to know eaci other better before.going so far.&#xD;
It is true he is a stranger in one sense of the word, but we have&#xD;
been so long exchanging sentiments and feelings that I feel that I&#xD;
have known him for years. He has never attempted to deceive&#xD;
ne; I think I know his pecuniary circumstances; I believe him&#xD;
to. be the very soul of honor. I received such a kind, fatherly&#xD;
letter from his father a few days ago. You know that for nearly&#xD;
two years I have been very lonely, my only parent having been&#xD;
taken from me. I have never known a mother's love, and he tells&#xD;
me his mother is very affectionate, and will welcome me with&#xD;
open arms...&#xD;
Now, dearest Nellie, I am to be his very soon, about the middle&#xD;
of January-and I have a proposition to make to you. I have no&#xD;
sister, and no relative I love as I do you, and I wish you to offi-&#xD;
ciate as first bridesmaid, and accompany me to my bright Southern&#xD;
home. Sammie wrote me to secure you asia travelling companion.&#xD;
I think a winter in the South will bring a few roses into your pale&#xD;
cheeks. Do not refuse me, dearest friend, as I have set my heart&#xD;
on having you with me. I have written to Nora to gain your&#xD;
father's consent. She will be at my marriage, which will take place&#xD;
at an early hour in the evening, su as to be at the boat in time for&#xD;
Richmond. Do not fail me.&#xD;
Yours fondly,        LIZZIE IRBY.&#xD;
There was not much persuasion required, to gain Ella's con-&#xD;
sent, and Nora's exquisite taste was displayed in the purchase of&#xD;
articles necessary for such a journey. Mr. Morrison gave a free&#xD;
consent, since he hoped his pet would be restored to him in the&#xD;

spring in the bloom of health. There is something strangely ex-&#xD;
hilarating and exciting in preparing for a journey, particularly&#xD;
when we have in contemplation a visit, to a land so balmy and&#xD;
beautiful as our own bright, sunny South, and Ella's step became&#xD;
more elastic, and a smile was at times seen to hover around her&#xD;
mouth. She had less leisure for study or meditation, as she had a&#xD;
great deal to do before she could leave home for so long a time,&#xD;
and her father augured well from these signs. If the anticipation&#xD;
could do so much, what would not the reality accomplish ?&#xD;
The weeks flew rapidly by, and after taking a tearful farewell&#xD;
of her father, Ella, accompanied by Nora and her husband, sought&#xD;
the home of her friend, whom she saw married a few days after;&#xD;
and bidding farewell to her cousin, who promised to see her&#xD;
father very often and attend to any little wants of his during her&#xD;
absence, was borne away to the boat en route for Richmond. She&#xD;
soon learned to like Mr.. Duval, who was a noble specimen of&#xD;
Southern chivalry -a genuine courtly Carolinian, and she found&#xD;
herself tracing out a path of perfect happiness for her friend.&#xD;
After a short sojourn in Richmond, they left by the Southern&#xD;
route for Greenville, South Carolina. Everything was new to our&#xD;
heroine, and as she entered the Palmetto State everything was so&#xD;
different from what she left behind her. Here she left snow and&#xD;
ice, leafless trees, and an absence of birds; there she found the'&#xD;
live oak and magnolia, the orange and palmetto, and the long&#xD;
gray moss hanging in festoons and swaying gracefully from the&#xD;
arms of the giant oaks, while the mocking-birds were singing&#xD;
gayly all the day. 0, who would not give themselves up to the&#xD;
enjoyment of such beauty? and Ella thought, "What must have&#xD;
been the glory of this, Eden ere the serpent entered it in the shape&#xD;
of the devastating Yankee?" They might destroy her cherished&#xD;
institutions, lay waste her fertile cotton and rice fields, cause the&#xD;
scourge of fire to pass over hpr beautiful savannas, but her de-&#xD;
lightful climate they could not change; and ever-provident&#xD;
Nature, if left alone, would soon recuperate and resume her&#xD;
wonted glories.&#xD;

Arrived at G reenville, our travellers found a hea rty welcome -l&#xD;
from those whoseC hospitadlity is pr1is 4oerbial. Eilla was chameU('d,R&#xD;
and for awhile forgol her Ownt roubles in contemlajhlt tig the hap-&#xD;

fair Virginia t ower, transplanted to their genial clime, and sev-&#xD;
eral parties were givel in honor' Of the mrrage ot one so highly&#xD;
esteemed as Mr, Duvat  Our heroine soon became quite a belle,&#xD;
and received many cali  H ad her heart been free it might have&#xD;
been taken captive by some one of the many fine young men of&#xD;
that vicinity.&#xD;
A month passed by (delight fully to all parties, and Mr. DIval&#xD;
baving some business to transact in Augusta, GIeorgia, asked&#xD;
Lizzie and Ella to accompany liim, They joyfully accepted the in-&#xD;
vitation, and spent two pleasant days in Walking about that fine&#xD;
old city. On the third day, as they were on their way to the de-&#xD;
not, some horses became frightened and made for the sidewalk,&#xD;
along which our trio were wending their way. Ella was nearest&#xD;
the street and would have been trampled under their feet, but for&#xD;
the timely interposition of a strong arm which drew her forcibly&#xD;
into a store near at hand. She fainted,,and it was several min-&#xD;
utes before she recovered.' Mr. Duval knew the young gentleman,&#xD;
and introduced him to Mrs. Duval and Miss Morrison of Virginia,&#xD;
as Lieutenant Williams. Ella cast one hurried, frightened glance&#xD;
at the stranger, and would have fallen but for Mr. Duval, who&#xD;
eaurht her in his arms. as he exclaimed: "Poor Nelhe, she must&#xD;
he nurt." Lizzie was weeping, and the kind stranger proposed&#xD;
that he should call a hack and take her to the hotel. She opened&#xD;
her eves and said.&#xD;
You have saved my life, and I am very grateful," and she&#xD;
held out :er finely shaped hand, which he pressed, as lie .blushed&#xD;
deeply as any schoolbuy would have done; then turning and&#xD;

Mri. iuval thanked Lieutenant Wiliams ffor the very grt&#xD;
service he bid rendered them, and asked him to conme p to reen-&#xD;
Ville to see themn. He replied that he was on his way to the de-&#xD;
pot wh en he was so fortunate as to be of service to them, and ex-&#xD;
pected to be in Greenville that evening  was glad to find they&#xD;
were going the same way, as he -hoped to become better ac-&#xD;
qu painted with his lady and her friend.&#xD;
Mr. )uval called a hack, and all four were -hurried to the de-&#xD;
pot, which they reached just in time for the train. Lizzie was&#xD;
very much please with the stranger, and conversed with/ him&#xD;
freely, feelirig very grateful to him, and winning upon his good&#xD;
opinion by her anxiety for her silent friend, who had drawn her&#xD;
veil over her face, and sat watching every expression of a face,&#xD;
the exact counterpart of the picture she had in her trunk. At&#xD;
last she closed her eyes, to shut out the black cloud of misery she&#xD;
,had created for herself. Nothing but the. anxiety of her friends&#xD;
lest she had received some serious hurt, restored her, in a measure,&#xD;
to herself. After a while she entered into the conversation atn&#xD;
exerted herself to please, since she saw her kind friends wished it,&#xD;
and succeeded beyond her expectations,&#xD;
That evening Lieutenant Williams took tea with them, and,&#xD;
as he had business in the country near town, remained two weeks,&#xD;
spending every evening with them, until Ella looked for his com-&#xD;
ing with a heightened color and nervousness which her friends&#xD;
noted and commented on. He and Ella had walked out together&#xD;
nearly-every evening or ridden on horseback in the eariy morn.&#xD;
had visited every spot of natural beauty in ten miles of Green-&#xD;
vile, and were becoming desperately in love with each other. It&#xD;
was on the last evening of his stay that' Mr. Duval invited ithe&#xD;
young people of the town to meet at his house, in honor of his&#xD;
two young friends, Robert and Ella. Lizzie insisted that Ela&#xD;
should wear white, and when she came down stairs for her friend's&#xD;
inspection, before the guests assembled, she did not see Robert,&#xD;
who had come in early, hoping to have her company awhile all to&#xD;
himself, Lizzie exclaimed :&#xD;
"Nellie, you are really beautiful to-night : more so, if possible.&#xD;
than you were at Nora Stanhope's wedding. and I thought you&#xD;
perfect then."&#xD;

Is her husband as proud and happy as she is ?&#xD;
Yes, fully as much so, and he has a right to he so, for she is&#xD;
noted for her beauty, intelligence and goodness. What more&#xD;
could he wish  r besides, she never loved any but him"&#xD;
" She was not too good to deceive another, and to carry on&#xD;
that deception to within a few days of her marriage."&#xD;
Nora Stanhope a deceiver ! 'Impossible. Pray, what do you&#xD;
know of her ?''&#xD;
Too much,. Mrs. Duval. She had nearly shaken my faith in&#xD;

and walked out on the colonnade, where he saw a white-robed fig.;&#xD;
ure. leaning against a pillar. weeping bitterly, His thoughts&#xD;
were very bitter as he left the palor.&#xD;
True. he had never told Nora in so many words that he&#xD;
ovec her. still his language must have been understood by her as&#xD;
something more than mere friendship ; and she had written as{&#xD;
unreservedly, giving free expression to sentiments which his too&#xD;
partial eve had construed into something more tender than friend-&#xD;
ship Now, the past came vividly before his mind's eye, and he&#xD;
tried in vain to recall some expression of hers that resembled love,&#xD;
and he said to himself:&#xD;
It was nothing more than a pleasant pastime with her, and&#xD;
I should not have yielded myself up to such a sweet fancy." His&#xD;
anger vanished, aid he thought only of this, sweet maiden who&#xD;
had almost obliterated from his memory the bitter past., and going&#xD;
up to her. he said :S&#xD;
'orgive me if I have caused this grief. Is. she your friend&#xD;

She raised her tearful face, which was very pale, and he thought'&#xD;

less attention to his description of the letters she had written, and&#xD;
felt pleased at his praises ; how he had learned to love one whom&#xD;
he had never seen, and would have been willing to make her his&#xD;
bride, so well satisfied was he as to her purity and truthfulness&#xD;
but had hesitated to declare his love until he was able to visit her&#xD;
how he had been (hocked and disappointed when in answer to&#xD;
his last letter, he received an  invitation to her marriage.&#xD;
'Ella hesitated, but it was for a short time only. It was her&#xD;
duty to clear her cousin fromall suspicions. She had been the&#xD;
culprit, and Nora must not he blamed. At length she turned her&#xD;
eye full upon his face, and she asked, almost inaudibly:&#xD;
" If I were to tell you that another had used my cousin's&#xD;
name, and that she had never written a line to you, would you&#xD;
believe me?"&#xD;
"Yes, if you were to tell me you knew the fact, I could not&#xD;
doubt your word."&#xD;
"Could you," she continued " love her who had deceived you,&#xD;
if you were told that a feeling of delicacy prompted her to use&#xD;
another's name, by that other's consent, and had learned to look&#xD;
for those friendly messengers with too much anxiety for her peace&#xD;
of mind, until that friend of hers was about to change her name&#xD;
at the altar, then, fearing that you would not believe her if she&#xD;
wrote you the truth, and would feel a sovereign contempt for heu.&#xD;

her too much agitated for self-support, I suppose, as he placed a&#xD;
strong arm around her and asked':&#xD;
"Ella, my sweet friend, am I correct in hoping that lady was&#xD;
yourself?&#xD;
She dropped herlead to hide her confusion as she murmured:&#xD;
You do not hate her then ? "&#xD;
Hate her ? No ; but would love her with all my heart if she&#xD;
would permit me. Will you, Nellie ? "&#xD;
She smiled through her tears as she asked :&#xD;
"You really forgive me ?"&#xD;
" Yes, upon one condition, which is, since you dislike. your&#xD;
name so much, youv-will consent to change it once more, and that,&#xD;
very soon."&#xD;
I suppose her consent was gained, as they appeared very&#xD;
happy when they entered the house.&#xD;
Lizzie, who was indignant at the aspersions cast upon her&#xD;
friend's character, had to have the whole story told her, and was&#xD;
delighted at the thought of having Ella near her. In beautiful,&#xD;
balmy April, when the magnolias were in bloom, Lieutenant&#xD;
Williams escorted Ella to her home, her health fully restored,&#xD;
and a happy light in her eye, which did her father's heart good.&#xD;
When the autumn came there was a quiet wedding, and followed&#xD;
by many tears and blessings, Ella left her childhood's home for&#xD;
the home of her husband on the banks of the beautiful Savannah.&#xD;
This time her father could not stay behind. He sold his property&#xD;
in Virginia, and went to make his home with his only child.&#xD;
Now we will bid the reader farewell, with the hope that our&#xD;
little story may serve to amuse him or her for a short while in&#xD;
these times of general gloom. Adieu!&#xD;

Alice Chester had been married five years. The world looked&#xD;
on and wondered when Charles Chester, the proud, man of the&#xD;
world, who had withstood the fascinations of so many city belles,&#xD;
until at the age of thirty-five he married the simple country maiden&#xD;
of twenty, and took her to preside over his city home. But the&#xD;
Mrs. Grundys were disappointed if they expected to find what&#xD;
they termed "rustic simplicity.". Her natural love of the beau-&#xD;
tiful had been cultivated and trained in a proper direction. Her&#xD;
father's plain farm-house had been visited by none but the refined&#xD;
and the excellent of her vicinity.&#xD;
Charles Chester had met her at the residence of a country&#xD;
friend, and been won by her modesty and good sense; and after&#xD;
six months of devotion, such as she had read of in novels, he in-&#xD;
duced her to leave her wildwood bower for one of more artistic&#xD;
excellence in the city. She was passionately fond of books, music&#xD;
and flowers; and many rare volumes of poetry, which she had&#xD;
longed for without having the means of obtaining them, were fur-&#xD;
nished by her lover, and bright pictures were drawn of the beau-&#xD;
tiful home he had for her. With her poet's love of the beautiful,&#xD;
and the elegances of refined society, which was to be gratified by&#xD;
a union with the really fine-looking and seemingly appreciative&#xD;
man before her, how could she reject him? He was the hero of&#xD;
her romantic fancy, and, she loved him with all the ardor and&#xD;
purity of her nature.&#xD;
She was happy in her new home - happier far than she had&#xD;
thought it possible for her to be. True, she was disappointed in&#xD;
the society around her. All who visited her were men and women&#xD;
of fashion -gay, giddy, and altogether uncongenial; their only&#xD;
topics of conversation were the amusements and trifling on dits of&#xD;

the season. Still she had her books and music, and her husband's&#xD;
society every evening. She was a stranger in the city, and made&#xD;
few calls, for the reason that he never went with her, and she did&#xD;
not like to depend on strangers for those acts of politeness which&#xD;
she had a right to expect from her husband ; consequently she&#xD;
was called unsocial. She wondered why he who ws apparently&#xD;
fond of her music and conversation, should not prefer to have in-&#xD;
tellectual friends'to visit him. He never offered to take her to a&#xD;
lecture or any literary or musical treat in town, and when she&#xD;
ventured to say she would like .to hear a popular lecturer who&#xD;
was stopping in their city, he spoke rather shortly, she thought,&#xD;
and said that was the way with women, they were never satisfied&#xD;
with what they had. She did not insist, but the first tears of dis-&#xD;
appointment were shed during the still hours of that night. 11cr&#xD;
housekeeping was never neglected. She had good servants, but&#xD;
her mother had taught her that a lady should rule her own-house&#xD;
and see that things were kept in order, and her husband could&#xD;
find no fault with her in that particular. A very few months&#xD;
served to show her that she was mistaken in her estimate of her&#xD;
husband's character. Naturally tyrannical, he soon began to show'&#xD;
symptoms of a desire to be master of her actions and desires. He&#xD;
wearied of feigng a devotion he did not feel, and thought she&#xD;
bad no right to complain when her wants were supplied. Her de-&#xD;
votion did not abate. She took an interest in his business, to'&#xD;
please him, and did everything in her power to make home&#xD;
pleasant and cheerful. He told her women knew nothing of busi-&#xD;
ness, and he did not like to be questioned. If she read the po-&#xD;
litical papers and tried to interest him thus, he did not like to see&#xD;
women meddling with politics; thus rudely severing every' link&#xD;
which bound them together.'&#xD;
Before her marriage she had been engaged in writing for a&#xD;
literary journal; now in her isolation she resorted to that prolific&#xD;
field for enjoyment. Her contributions became more frequent,&#xD;
and of such a character as to attract the attention of the press.&#xD;
She received a letter from her publisher, requesting her to write'&#xD;
exclusively and constantly for his journal for'a stipulated amount.&#xD;
She showed the letter to her husband, who angrily forbade her&#xD;
making any such engagement. "I have submitted to this thing&#xD;

because I thought you wanted some amusement, but the moment&#xD;
you begin to receive remuneration for your writing you must&#xD;
support yourself independent of me." Her eyes were often&#xD;
heavy with the weight of unshed tears, but she forced them back&#xD;
and tried to be cheerful and to seem contented with her lot. In&#xD;
her few visits to her parents she let no word escape her to lead&#xD;
them to believe she was unhappy. I believe that tyranny grows&#xD;
upon what it feeds on, and that tyrants are ever cowardly.&#xD;
Twelve months after her marriage, and the very morning after&#xD;
Alice's reception of that' letter from her publisher, several gentle-&#xD;
men were sitting in Mr. Chester's counting-room, when Arthur&#xD;
Morton, a young friend of Mr. Chester's, took from his pocket a&#xD;
magazine and said: "I would give much to know the author of&#xD;
this article by 'Alice.' I have read her sketches and essays for the&#xD;
past two years, and never saw anything better from the pen of a&#xD;
woman. Have you read any of them, Charlie? This last one is&#xD;
excellent." Mr. Chester spoke very shortly, "I never read any-&#xD;
thing written by a woman." A man present, who had been a fre-&#xD;
quent visitor at Mr. Chester's, spoke up: "Why, Morton, they&#xD;
tell me Mrs. Chester is the author of those sketches. Her name&#xD;
is Alice. No one would ever suppose that she was a writer, she&#xD;
is so quiet and retiring in her manners. I. have always thought&#xD;
literary women were either fast or blue, but Charlie's little lady-&#xD;
bird has changed my opinion." Mr. Morton was deservedly noted&#xD;
for his literary talents, and was no mean critic. Mr. Chester&#xD;
knew that well enough, but he had that mean, selfish disposition&#xD;
which does not like for any one to admire what -is underrated by&#xD;
itself,'and he was almost ready to crush his former friend, when&#xD;
he laid his hand on his arm and said: " Why, Charlie, you cer-&#xD;
tainly have not kept the fact that your wife was 'a lady of such&#xD;
talents from your friend who is always ready to fall down and&#xD;
worship genius ? You ought to be proud of her, man. Strange&#xD;
that you have never asked me to call on you since your marriage.&#xD;
I have never seen your wife. Really, Charlie, if she were mine,&#xD;
I should consider myself rich in the possession of such a treasure.&#xD;
Shall I ask myself to call on you this evening?"  It was with&#xD;
difficulty that Mr. Chester could preserve his usual politeness,&#xD;
but he did so, and replied, "Certainly, Arthur, come by the store&#xD;

and I will go with you to my residence." When he went to&#xD;
dinner that day he ordered his wife to discontinue her contribu-&#xD;
tions to the press. " My dear husband," she pleaded, "I do not&#xD;
neglect any duty for my writing. It is such a comfort to me dur-&#xD;
ing your absence at the -store, and I have so much time unem-&#xD;
ployed otherwise." "I will not have my wife known as a literary&#xD;
woman. Had you heard the conversation in my store to-day&#xD;
relative to that very article you were-working on last week, you&#xD;
would not feel so much like writing such nonsense. Arthur&#xD;
Morton criticised- it severely, and George. Carter said in my&#xD;
presence that all literary women were fast, and he knew all the&#xD;
time that you wrote it, for I heard him telling Morton so," Her&#xD;
face flushed as she-arose from the table and laid her hand on his&#xD;
slh ulder.  Her voice was hoarse with emotion as she said,&#xD;
" Charlie, you used to praise my talents. You have told me that&#xD;
you were first attracted to me by my modesty, then held bound&#xD;
by that and my good, sense. Those were your words, my hus-&#xD;
band. Then why did you not contradict that libel on my class?&#xD;
I am not fast, and I am a literary woman. Discontinuing my&#xD;
contributions to the press will not change my nature, neither will&#xD;
it prevent my name being known as a writer if it  s already,&#xD;
talked about. It was very rude in George Carter toy say that&#xD;
even if it had been true, when he knew your wife was a literary&#xD;
woman. He must not come here any more. .I do not wish to&#xD;
associate with men so wanting in common politeness. I had&#xD;
thought better of Mr. Carter than that. As regards Mr. Morton's&#xD;
criticisms, I expect to be criticised, and I do not think my style&#xD;
free from faults."  He arose from the table, pushed her from him&#xD;
and said : "It is useless to argue the question farther. I will not&#xD;
have my wife known as a literary character. As regards George&#xD;
Carter's visits to my house, he will take tea with us to-night in,&#xD;
company with Arthur Morton, and you, must ,not only receive&#xD;
them, but treat Carter as you have always done." " I can't do it,,&#xD;
Mr. Chester. I have some pride. You are too proud to have&#xD;
your wife .kno wn as a literary woman. I am proud'enough to,&#xD;
resent an insult when my husband fails in his duty." There was&#xD;
a stern determination in her eyes and compressed lips that he had&#xD;
never seen there before. He was awed for a moment, but the brute&#xD;

soon overpowered the man, and he said coarsely: "You can be&#xD;
as tragic as you please, madam, but if George Carter is treated&#xD;
with any rudeness to-night, you will be turned out into the street&#xD;
before morning. I shall be master of my own house." He called&#xD;
the cook and gave orders that supper should be ready by eight&#xD;
o'clock and everything should be 'nice. Alice hurried off to her&#xD;
chamber, too angry to weep or to think what she should do. It&#xD;
was the first time she had dared to speak for herself. The more&#xD;
she had yielded the more tyrannical he had become. George&#xD;
Carter had been the most pleasant, because the most -sensible of&#xD;
the gentlemen visitors at her house, and she had liked his com-&#xD;
pany very well. Now, what should she do? Must she submit'to&#xD;
insult from others as well as tyranny from her husband ? She&#xD;
turned her head. There lay her portfolio with the fruits of many.&#xD;
pleasant hours that she must resign, and for what ? Just to please&#xD;
him. Had not her pleasures been curtailed until she had scarcely&#xD;
anything left ? Should she yield ? Was it her duty ?, There was&#xD;
her Bible, her mother's gift. She opened it instinctively and read:&#xD;
"Wives, obey your husbands, as, Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling&#xD;
him lord." She laid it down and fell on her knees. After an&#xD;
hour of self-communion and prayer for guidance she went about&#xD;
her duties. Her writing materials were stowed away and locked&#xD;
up. After going to the parlor and dining-room and seeing that&#xD;
everything was in order, she returned to dress for tea. The old&#xD;
rebellion tried to master her. " I will not see him. Let him turn&#xD;
me out. I can make my own living. My parents' arms are open&#xD;
to receive me. They never wounded me thus." Then her duty.&#xD;
Was it not plainly written in her Bible? She brushed out her&#xD;
beautiful auburn hair, and put it back in shining, waving bands,&#xD;
with a single Cape jasmine on one side of her finely formed&#xD;
head. She took out her dresses and selected one which her hus-&#xD;
band had particularly admired, a delicate blue organda muslin,&#xD;
and having arrayed herself with exquisite taste, she surveyed her-&#xD;
self in a large mirror and found nothing to complain of in her&#xD;
tout ensemnle. There was a mist in her large hazel eyes and a flush&#xD;
on her cheek which but enhanced her beauty as her visitors were&#xD;
ushered into her presence. There was a lifting of the frown from&#xD;
her husband's brow and a faint smile which did not escape her&#xD;

notice, as she responded to Mr. Carter's cordial salutation with a&#xD;
rather stately, though polite, " Good evening, Mr. Carter."  Mr.&#xD;
Morton was perfectly fascinated by the vision of beauty and&#xD;
modest intelligence, and soon became a fixture by Alice's side.&#xD;
Mr. Carter's advances were met with a polite reserve which was&#xD;
puzzling to him, since he had become a familiar guest. The half&#xD;
hour preceding supper was spent in general conversation ; Alice&#xD;
surpassed herself. 'At supper she presided with grace and dignity.&#xD;
At the conclusion of the meal Mr. Morton offered his arm to con.-&#xD;
dpct her to the parlor as he said, " I dare say Mr. Chester told&#xD;
y)u of our conversation at his store this morning?" " Yes, sir,&#xD;
he did." She flushed at the remembrance of the dinner hour, and&#xD;
her hand trembled visibly on his arm. ie was silent a moment, then&#xD;
as he seated himself on the-sofa beside her, he continued: " I did&#xD;
not know that you ever wrote for the press until this morning.&#xD;
I have seen your articles for the past two years and admired them&#xD;
more than I can tell you, but did inot know the author was the&#xD;
wife of my old friend Charlie Chester, until George Carter .told&#xD;
me so this morning. Do you know, Mrs. Chester, that you&#xD;
have disabused George's mind of a very erroneous opinion he once&#xD;
entertained of the literati? "  She turned her large eyes full upon&#xD;
his face and said eagerly : "I disabused his mind ? Did he not&#xD;
say this very morning that all literary women were fast? Oh,&#xD;
Mr. Morton, you can never know what an effort it has cost me to&#xD;
meet him politely. I did not care for your poor opinion of my&#xD;
writings as I did for any one's bad opinion of my reputation as a&#xD;
lady. You 'had a right to criticise my writings, they are public&#xD;
property, but he had no right to say it, and Mr. Chester should not&#xD;
have --" she stopped short. " Pardon me, my indignation has,&#xD;
led me too. far." "Mrs. Chester, my dear madam, you were cer.&#xD;
tainly misinformed, through what motive I cannot divine. I will&#xD;
tell you what was said by both. of us," and he related the conver-&#xD;
sation of the morning. She listened eagerly, then clasping her,&#xD;
hands, she said, " Thank God, I am undeceived. I do not like to&#xD;
think harshly of any one. I must not let Mr. Carter think I am&#xD;
angry with him without a cause."  She did not tell him anything&#xD;
to cause him to think less of her husband. Mr. Chester and his&#xD;
friend came in from the porch where they had been enjoying ,&#xD;

their cigars, and when Mr. Carter came forward and asked for&#xD;
music, she arose quickly and smilingly seated herself at the piano.&#xD;
She sang song after song, until her listeners felt as though they&#xD;
were floating off "on the waves of her sweet singing." Even&#xD;
her husband was smilingly kind and affectionate in his manner&#xD;
toward her. She was conscious of looking remarkably well, and&#xD;
now her spirits rose above the troubles of the afternoon, and she&#xD;
knew that she was doing well, appearing to the best advantage.&#xD;
The night passed off happily; the morrow brought a black cloud.&#xD;
Jealousy, the green-eyed monster, was lurking beneath that pleas-&#xD;
ait exterior of the night before. When Alice bade her lord a&#xD;
pleasant " good morning," he frowned on her and said: "So your&#xD;
opposition to my asking Mr. Carter to my house was all feigned,&#xD;
was it ? You looked a little stately at first, it is true, but your&#xD;
very great amiability toward the close of the evening was plain&#xD;
enough to my mind that the first was only acting to deceive me."&#xD;
She drew back from the hand he had laid on her shoulder. "Mr.&#xD;
Chester, you know that you do me injustice. Why did you ask&#xD;
Mr. Carter to your house and command me to receive him cor-&#xD;
dially or be thrust into the street ? Those were your words. I&#xD;
did not fear being thrust into the street, for I know I can support&#xD;
myself by my literary labors; but my Bible tells me to obey my&#xD;
husband, and I have tried to do so, at what a sacrifice of feeling&#xD;
you can never know. I have never knowingly disobeyed you in&#xD;
anything. The story you told me of Mr. Carter's opinion of me&#xD;
was manufactured for the occasion. Believe me, sir, I should&#xD;
.have remained coldly polite to him had not Mr. Morton repeated&#xD;
the conversation in your store more truthfully, I believe, than&#xD;
you did, thereby exonerating Mr. Carter. Thrust me into the&#xD;
street if you will, I have borne enough. I will not bear jealousy&#xD;
added to my other wrong," and she left the 'room. She did not&#xD;
see him again that day. When he came home the next evening&#xD;
his eyes were red and every lineament of his face showed dissipa-&#xD;
tion. She had been suspecting him 'of drinking and gambling,&#xD;
but until then he had never been so very drunk in her presence.&#xD;
He seemed to have forgotten the abuse of the day before, and she&#xD;
ministered to him as best she could, shedding scalding drops of&#xD;
tears in secret. When he got sober she remonstrated with him,&#xD;

begging him for the sake of this good name to desist. He seemed&#xD;
penitent and promised reformation ; told her he had been drink-&#xD;
ing a long time, that'was what made him so- cross, but she was&#xD;
the angel to reform him.&#xD;
Six months passed away, six months of bitter trial to the&#xD;
young wife.  Dissipation had taken fast hold upon Charles&#xD;
Chester. He lost large sums at cards, until his store was closed,&#xD;
his house and furniture sold, and he left penniless. Then she&#xD;
proved an angel indeed. She went with him to a distant State,&#xD;
where he tried spasmodically to reform and to get into business.&#xD;
Two years of such privations and'hardships as she never thought&#xD;
she could perform she had to endure, and every cent she made by&#xD;
her needle, if not spent as soon- as earned in provisions, went for&#xD;
intoxicating drinks, until Charles Chester became as low as a man'&#xD;
can well become. His patient wife had long ago lost all respect&#xD;
for him; nothing but a sense of duty kept her with him -the hope&#xD;
that she might win him from his wickedness. She who might&#xD;
have been the pride of a literary circle wasthe debased wife of a&#xD;
low drunkard, forced to the most menial toil for subsistence, and&#xD;
subject to the worst kind of abuse from him who should have&#xD;
been her protector. He forbade her writing to her friends, so&#xD;
that all hope of help from them was cut off. At length he was illy&#xD;
very ill, and the fear of death caused him to permit her to write&#xD;
to her father.. She did so, -and hesent her means to take them to&#xD;
his house. She had begged him to permit her to send some ar-&#xD;
ticle to a newspaper which was paying for literary contributions,&#xD;
but he persistently refused. When they were ready. to start&#xD;
home she made up a roll of literary articles and went out osten-&#xD;
sibly to purchase a pair of shoes, telling him she had a little&#xD;
money she had made by sewing while he was sick, but she wended&#xD;
her way to a newspaper office, and showed her articles together&#xD;
with some letters she had received from the editor of the ---&#xD;
Magazine. The editor was a polite, kind man, and told her to call;&#xD;
again in two hours. She did so, and received ten dollars for the&#xD;
articles, with which she purchased a few articles of clothing and&#xD;
a travelling bonnet. He was in too much of a hurry to fly from&#xD;
death, as he thought, to be angry when she told him the truth.&#xD;
In a week they were at her father's house. How different in&#xD;

appearance and in feelings ! Her parents received them kindly--&#xD;
their daughter oh how gladly, and her husband kindly for her&#xD;
sake. Three years and a half of married life and not .one year of&#xD;
true happiness ! Now that she was at home, shielded by a moth-&#xD;
er's love, the long strain upon her nervous system brought on a&#xD;
low wasting fever, and for months she was but a shadow of her&#xD;
former self. Her husband, whose energies were dead, insisted&#xD;
now on her writing for money to support themselves, but she was&#xD;
unequal to the task, and for twelve months she felt that she could&#xD;
never write again. Her brain seemed paralysed. When she re-&#xD;
covered so as to be able to go out, and feel sufficient strength of&#xD;
mind and body, she undertook to teach a few pupils at her&#xD;
father's residence, and succeeded in 'making a small sum, which&#xD;
her husband took and went off with upon the plea that he was&#xD;
looking for business. She had given him clothing sufficient to&#xD;
last him two years. He remained four months, and returned&#xD;
without a cent of money, and no clothing but what he had on.&#xD;
Her friends urged a separation, as he came home drinking, with&#xD;
every sign of having been on a spree all the time of his absence.&#xD;
" Until death us do part," she repeated. Sometimes her strength&#xD;
almost failed her, and she shuddered as lie came into her presence.&#xD;
When he taunted her with not loving him, she felt that he spoke&#xD;
the truth, but she dare not say so, She only replied, " Love be-&#xD;
gets love." He was cross and disagreeable in her father's family.&#xD;
.She saw that they bore it only for her sake, and the fact made her&#xD;
miserable. She would have left with him, much as she loved her&#xD;
parents and feared her husband, so firm was her belief that she&#xD;
was doing her duty. Six months passed in her little school. To&#xD;
relieve the pressure of disagreeable thoughts upon her brain, she&#xD;
resorted to her pen once more. This time the ideas came without&#xD;
much effort,-and she found that practice made them flow faster.&#xD;
0, the pleasure of thislong-forbidden occupation ! She .wrote to'&#xD;
offer her contributions to the Magazine again, but received an&#xD;
answer that they could not engage any more writers at present,&#xD;
their list was full. They had neve/- forgiven her for withdrawing&#xD;
from them four years previousl . There was.a new literary paper&#xD;
started in her native State; to that she wrote, and sent a specimen&#xD;
article. It was accepted; she wrote regularly for a few months,&#xD;

when she received a letter during her husband's absence froi&#xD;
Arthur Morton, whot was literary editor of the paper, telling her&#xD;
that he would pass through the country in a week or so and&#xD;
would call on her. le was an -old friend of her husband, some&#xD;
five years younger perhaps, still his friend, and as such she felt&#xD;
no hesitancy in .inviting him to call, She did not know until lie&#xD;
nVotc that he was connected with the paper. She had poured&#xD;
out her whole soul in her poems and stories, and her peculiar sor-&#xD;
rows were depicted in those of her heroines; She was thinner,&#xD;
and there were a few lines of care plainly visible in her face, still&#xD;
she had the same sweetsmile and low gentle voice, the same&#xD;
childlike simplicity and earnestness of manner.  When Mr.&#xD;
Morton came he held her hand as he looked into her. face and&#xD;
said, " The same, a little older, a little more .careworn, still the,&#xD;
same true woman. " Her husband was present at the meeting,&#xD;
and a glance at himn showed his brow to darken and his lips to&#xD;
compress. She withdrew her hand as she said, " I ani always the&#xD;
same to my husband's $friends and mine, Mr. lorton."  She had&#xD;
not seen him since that memorable evening on which he was pre-&#xD;
.sented to her. . As her husband's friend she had received him&#xD;
kindly, and had been very favorably impressed by his noble bear-&#xD;
ing and true gentlemanly deportment, as by the beauty and deli-&#xD;
cacy of his sentiments. It was a treat, ",a feast of reason and a&#xD;
flow of soul" which she had never forgotten; and that one friend&#xD;
of an evening was often thought of, and those few short hours&#xD;
looked back upon as the one oasis in her desert life. Her pleasure&#xD;
at his coming now, after four years of silence, was great, though&#xD;
mixed with dread of her husband's strange jealous temper. He&#xD;
judged every person's motives by his own, and did not believe it&#xD;
possible for two persons of the opposite sexes to enjoy each&#xD;
pther's society, or exchange sentiments upon intellectual subjects&#xD;
.lone. His wife was watched and guygled as though he expected&#xD;
every man who saw her to wish to rob him of her. It is said that&#xD;
jealousy cannot exist without love. That may be true, but save&#xD;
me, 0 fate, from such love! Charles Chester could not begin to&#xD;
understand or to value the pure spirit of his wife. How she could*&#xD;
have loved him and how she longed to do so, to commune with&#xD;
him as her equal, as a twin-born soul, he could not know. His.&#xD;
&#xD;
spirit was too coarse, too sensual for communion with hers. O,&#xD;
is it a sin to break such bands? 'fo sever those whom God has&#xD;
never joined together ? But I roust not stop to moralise. -fTwo&#xD;
days Mr. Chester seemed to share his wife's pleasure at the com-&#xD;
ing of his friend. Only she knew better, she only knew of the&#xD;
low, brutal taunts and threats when alone with him in her chan-&#xD;
her. She tried to prevent their disagreeients from being known,&#xD;
and to act as, though she were free in the presence of their guest.&#xD;
On the third morning, after the most shameless abuse, such as&#xD;
brought the crimson flush of shame to her delicate cheek, he left.&#xD;
saying he would never live with her again. She might go with&#xD;
Morton and welcome. She pled and remonstrated with him.&#xD;
He told her he had been tired of her a long time, and only stayed&#xD;
with her to spite her. When he had gone, she ran out to a bower&#xD;
formed of grape-vines, out of hearing and out of sight of the&#xD;
house, and throwing herself on the grass with her head on the&#xD;
rustic seat, gave vent to her anguish in groans and tears. "o,&#xD;
my God, must I bear it longer?" was the expression of her heart&#xD;
and lips. She could not tell her parents, they grieved enough for&#xD;
her at best. Where should she turn for comfort ? The God whom&#xD;
she had tried to serve seemed to have forsaken her. She tried to&#xD;
pray, but her faith was well-nigh dead ; for five years she had&#xD;
prayed, without any sign that her prayers were heard. Just then&#xD;
an arm was thrown around her, and her head raised from its&#xD;
lowly position. She looked up quickly, and beheld Arthur Mor-&#xD;
ton's eyes fixed upon her with such tender compassion. Her&#xD;
strength failed her, and her head dropped for a moment on his&#xD;
arm, and she sobbed in all the abandon of grief. He drew her&#xD;
nearer to him and spoke in a low tone, Alice, dear Alice, tell me&#xD;
what it is." She drew herself up from his arm and stood before&#xD;
him. "Mr. Morton," she said. "you have no right to address me&#xD;
in such language. Remember, sir, I am the wife of your friend.&#xD;
He drew back sadly and}leaned against the framework, with his&#xD;
fine eyes bent sadly on her. face as he said, " Mrs. Chester. you&#xD;
scorn my sympathy because you think I do not know the cause&#xD;
of your sorrow, I have known it for years, more than you ever&#xD;
supposed any one knew. Think you I coui not read it in your&#xD;

was very pale, and there was a wistful look in her sad dark eyes&#xD;
as she raised them to his face and tried to speak. He knelt before&#xD;
her, and clasped her hand as he pleaded with her to save herself&#xD;
from farther degradation. " Your parents desire it, you know;&#xD;
you have a sweet hine here if the trail of the serpent were not&#xD;
over it all. 0, Alice, banish that serpent forever." A gleam- of&#xD;
hope played for a moment over her sad features, then a cold&#xD;
shiver ran through her frame as she withdrew her hand from his&#xD;
clasp, and murmured almost inaudibly, "I cannot. 0, Mr. Mor-&#xD;
ton, pity me, but do not tempt me farther. 'Until death us do&#xD;
part,' was the vow I made at the altar five years ago; do not&#xD;
seek to change me. My duty ! Omy duty ! If I could think as&#xD;
you and my friends generally do that I had done more than my&#xD;
duty, I. might be happy yet; I might listen to your pleadings,&#xD;
dear friend, but I cannot. My vow was registered in heaven; I&#xD;
am his until death sets me free. Thank God, there is a future life-&#xD;
where friends may meet without reproach; until then farewell;&#xD;
we must not meet again." He tried to detain her, but she glided&#xD;

THE WIFE'S TEMPTA TION.                 109&#xD;
past him and tried to reach the house ; she took but a, few steps&#xD;
before she fainted and fell; he raised her tenderly in his arms,&#xD;
kissed her colorless cheek once, twice, then bore her to her&#xD;
mother, in whose care he left her, and was soon wending his way&#xD;
to the station&#xD;
When she recovered, her eyes wandered as if in search of some&#xD;
one. Her mother told her Mr. Morton had found her insensible&#xD;
in the grape arbor and had brought her in. She closed her eyes&#xD;
and lay so quietly her mother thought she was sleeping. 0, the&#xD;
agony of that quiet communion .with her own heart. Here was&#xD;
love and happiness offered her, appreciation and sympathy; she&#xD;
must turn from it all - for what? Ah ! the future would have&#xD;
to reveal the reason for all this suffering.&#xD;
Two months later Alice received a letter from a stranger in a&#xD;
distant State, saying her husband was very ill and desired her to&#xD;
go to him at once.. She did not hesitate a moment, but was soon&#xD;
on her way, she knew not to what further degradation -and suf-&#xD;
fering. When she reached her point of destination she found her&#xD;
husband very ill, apparently in a hopeless condition. She was&#xD;
repaid for her sacrifice and her triumph over her great temp-&#xD;
tation, when in his delirium he called her name, with every en-&#xD;
dearing epithet which was so sweet to her in the first months of&#xD;
their wedded life. Then he would mourn in agony and cry, "My&#xD;
poor injured darling, she must hate nie, she will never come.''&#xD;
We will pass over the days of delirium and danger. Enough&#xD;
that he did not die. There is nothing like sickness or sorrow to&#xD;
call forth all the latent energy and love of a woman's nature.&#xD;
With returning health Mr. Chester showed conclusively that he&#xD;
was a changed man. For months he was unable to attend to any&#xD;
business. When he recovered sufficiently they returned to her&#xD;
childhood's home, where he attended to the old farm and became&#xD;
a sober, good citizen, and a Christian and a most devoted hus-&#xD;
band to her whom he called his good genius.&#xD;
Did she ever recall the hours of darkness she had passed&#xD;
through ? Perhaps she did, but it was only to be grateful that&#xD;
she did not listen to the promptings of her own heart, or advice&#xD;
of well-meaning but mistaken friends. She heard Arthur Mor-&#xD;
ton's name without regret, and prayed that he might be as happy&#xD;
as she was.&#xD;

was particularly anxious to get into his church. He was very&#xD;
fond of Mr. Wilson's society and visitedjhin very frequently, ever&#xD;
finding his conversation both pleasant and instructive. He had&#xD;
well-nigh decided to renounce the pomups and vanities of this&#xD;
wicked world and unite with the JBev. Mr. Wilson's church.&#xD;
While thus pleasantly engaged, a man well known ine the vil-&#xD;
lage and its vicinity as a rough, dissolute character, living in&#xD;
abject poverty and steeped in vice, walked up and inquired for&#xD;
the Rev. Mr. Wilson. The reverend gentleman replied, "I am&#xD;
Mr. Wilson, what do you want ?" He replied, " My wife is very&#xD;
ill ; Dr. Brown says she can't live twenty-four hours. She heard&#xD;
you preach once, and is very anxious fdr you to go and pray with&#xD;
her before she dies. She is in great distress, sir, and I wish you&#xD;
would go at once."&#xD;
The poor man seemed deeply distressed, but he was a great&#xD;
sinner, and the propriety of going in to such a neighborhood must&#xD;
be considered. The minister answered coldly, "I will see what I&#xD;
can do for you."&#xD;
The disconsolate hovel to which he was invited was five miles&#xD;
distant, and in a neighborhood noted for its depravity. The Rev.&#xD;
Mr. Wilson had. a pleasant riding buggy and a valuable horse,&#xD;
and therefore could not excuse himself upon the plea that he had&#xD;
not the facilities for reaching the poor man's home.&#xD;
What must he do? This was the question which presented&#xD;
itself. Every instinct of his nature shrank from  such low&#xD;
associations, even for one hour. He consulted his wife. She&#xD;
urged him to go, and go quickly. He consented, provided brother&#xD;
Jones, an old and influential member of the church, would con-&#xD;
sent to accompany hinm.&#xD;
Brother Jones, it was ascertained, was from home, and would&#xD;
not return before nightfall. Brother Smith doubted the propriety&#xD;
of " mixing up " with such people. A visit to such a place&#xD;
might injure his usefulness, and excite remarks which might ren-&#xD;
der him less acceptable among his own circle. That was suf-&#xD;
cient to deter him from moving another step in a work of mercy.&#xD;
"It will not pay," was his comment as he returned home to&#xD;
inform the man that he could not go. His refusal was not&#xD;
smoothed in the least. An apology for not going with such a&#xD;
&#xD;
WILL    IT PAY?&#xD;
A MINISTER'S MISTAKE.&#xD;
Mr. Wilson was decidedly 'the most popular minister with&#xD;
which the church at Unionsville had ever been blessed. He&#xD;
preached good sound gospel sermons, and his hearers' . hearts&#xD;
were stirred by the earnest love and charity which ran through&#xD;
all his words. He was niuch liked by all denominations, and by&#xD;
sinners as well as saints. The church flourished, the congrega-&#xD;
tions were larger, and the finances in a much better condition&#xD;
than at any previous period of its history.&#xD;
The parsonage was in a wealthy and fashionable neighbor-&#xD;
hood, and the minister's family were invited out to ,dinner and&#xD;
to tea, while he was the life of every social gathering. Truly a&#xD;
minister so highly honored and universally petted must be sans&#xD;
reproche.&#xD;
Let us go to his home and see the motive-power of his actions.&#xD;
A lovely place was that village parsonage. Nature and art vied&#xD;
with each other in making it a worthy abode for God's chosen&#xD;
ministers - a place suggestive of- pure thoughts and lofty aspira-&#xD;
tions.&#xD;
Let us visit it in beautiful May, when the air is burthened&#xD;
with the perfume of many lovely flowers, and the free and happy&#xD;
songsters are caroling their songs of praise from the boughs of&#xD;
noble trees, and in and around all seems peaceful and pure.&#xD;
It was a balmy afternoon. A sumptuous dinner had been&#xD;
partaken of, and the family, together with a young friend, were&#xD;
seated on the piazza, engaged in pleasant converse. That young&#xD;
friend was Robert Armistead, an intelligent and wealthy young&#xD;
law-student, who had halted between two opinions for some time,&#xD;
almost persuaded to become a.Christian, and whom Mr. Wilson&#xD;

man would be out of place. 0  spirit of the meek and lowly&#xD;
Jesus, where dwellest thou ?&#xD;
The Rev. Mr. Wilson saw the look of deep anxiety and&#xD;
wretchedness in the man's fice change to one of deadly hate and&#xD;
rebellion as he turned off, but he heeded it not. Was not he&#xD;
above his anger, secure in the confidence of his people?&#xD;
Mrs, Wilson implored him to go, and offered to accompany&#xD;
him. He still refused, and gave- as a reason that the general good,&#xD;
of the church required himi to be very circumspect. There were&#xD;
evil-minded persons always watching a minister, and endeavoring&#xD;
to bring some charge against him, which would damage his power&#xD;
for good and bring reproach upon the church. This reasoning&#xD;
might be very conclusive to his mind, but his wife reasoned from&#xD;
her instinctive feeling for distressed humanity, and with tears&#xD;
coursing down her cheeks, plead:&#xD;
"0, my husband, did our blessed Saviour hesitate to do good&#xD;
because his subjects were poor and vile ? Did he shrink from the&#xD;
touch of Mary Magdalene, though he had.to cast out seven devils&#xD;
which possessed her? Do you not remember that, when rebuked&#xD;
for eating with publicans and sinners, he replied: 'I came not&#xD;
to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance'? and do we not&#xD;
read that 'there is joy in Heaven over one sinner that repenteth'?&#xD;
It does not read a rich and influential person, but a sinner. How&#xD;
can you hesitate? Even while I am pleading, a poor creature is&#xD;
dying and begging for the prayers of one of'God's ministers."&#xD;
Tears nor prayers could move him. Though he felt and&#xD;
knew it was his duty, yet "Will it pay ?" interposed and made&#xD;
him still refuse. While he might go and be instrumental in&#xD;
saving that poor woman's soul by so' doing, a dozen others mi ht&#xD;
be lost to his church. He thought it his duty to consider how he&#xD;
might accomplish the greatest amount of good and get the&#xD;
greatest number of members into the church.&#xD;
My readers may. think the picture overdrawn. Some say:&#xD;
" There never was such a case. No minister would .refuse to&#xD;
visit a dying person under any circumstances." Ah, reader, I&#xD;
thought so too, until cruelly undeceived by one in whose piety&#xD;
and self-denial I had perfect confidence.&#xD;
But we will proceed with the story. The young friend who&#xD;
&#xD;
was visiting the minister witnessed the whole scene, and listened&#xD;
to the importunities of the wife with pale face, as if his future&#xD;
peace depended on the result, until indignation forced him to&#xD;
seize his hat and leave very abruptly. He walked rapidly down&#xD;
the street to a house where a young minister, who had lately&#xD;
come among them as pastor of a new church, boarded with one&#xD;
of his churchmen. He knocked at~ the door, and asked for Mr.&#xD;
Allen, the minister. Mr. Allen was a quiet,-rather retiring young&#xD;
man, extremely modest, and not calculated to become very popular&#xD;
among people who admired fine social qualities, or. rhetorical&#xD;
flourishes in a minister.&#xD;
He came out and politely asked Mr. Armistead to walk in.&#xD;
Mr. A. quickly informed him that a man had just left the village&#xD;
who was anxious to get a minister to visit and pray. with his&#xD;
dying wife. Mr. Allen asked :&#xD;
"Where is the place, and how far must I go ? "&#xD;
"Five miles, and among the lowest class of persons in the&#xD;
State. Not many persons are willing to go to the neighborhood,&#xD;
though I thought I ought to tell you, as the man seemed so&#xD;
anxious,"&#xD;
"Not willing to go ?" was Mr. Allen's interruption. "My&#xD;
friend, can you think any place too low for a minister of the&#xD;
Gospel of Christ, or any person to visit on a mission of mercy ?&#xD;
Is not one immortal soul worth saving ? Not go ? I should be&#xD;
afraid to refuse to answer so manifest a call of duty. Excuse me&#xD;
a moment while I make a few necessary preparations. I have no&#xD;
horse and must walk, but that makes no difference, except that I&#xD;
may not be able to get there in time."&#xD;
A smile lighted up Mr. Armistead's face as he asked, " You&#xD;
surely would not walk five miles to visit an outcast from&#xD;
society ?&#xD;
"Certainly, sir, I would walk twice five miles to save an im-&#xD;
mortal soul."&#xD;
" Wait a moment, Mr. Allen ; I have a good horse and buggy,&#xD;
and will drive you there in a half hour, if you will accept the aid&#xD;
and society of an unregenerate man." Mr. Allen turned back&#xD;
and grasped his hand as he thanked him, and prayed silently that&#xD;
good might be accomplished by this visit.&#xD;

Our friends reached the hovel before the husband did, and&#xD;
when he got home, burning with indignation and resentment to-&#xD;
ward all who called themselves Christians, he was surprised to&#xD;
hear the voice of prayer in the house. He entered and found Mr.&#xD;
Allen kneeling by the side of. the bed, praying that the sick&#xD;
woman might have assurance that her sins were pardoned before&#xD;
she died. Near him knelt Robert Armistead-one the world called&#xD;
noble and delighted to honor, with tears falling over his clasped&#xD;
hands. Bitter as were his feelings when he reached home, the&#xD;
scene melted him to tears ; and when the minister arose from his&#xD;
knees, he was sitting upon the side of the bed holding a hand of&#xD;
his dying wife and weeping bitterly.  Several neighbors, as&#xD;
rough as he had ever been, hald gathered in and around the house,&#xD;
and were paying reverent attention to all the minister said. The'&#xD;
scene was so pure and sacred,.methinks the angels were leaning&#xD;
from Heaven and looking on with delight, ready to catch the tear&#xD;
of penitence and the first breath of saving faith, and bear them&#xD;
to the throne of the All-Father, that the door might be opened&#xD;
to admit the soul of the dying woman.&#xD;
The poor wife died, leaving the assurance that her sins were&#xD;
pardoned and the sting of death removed. The minister was re-&#xD;
quested to return on the morrow and read the burial service of&#xD;
his church. He complied with the request, and spoke words of&#xD;
comfort to the bereaved friends. When he left he was requested&#xD;
by several of the neighbors to' come and preach for them some-&#xD;
times. His visit was appreciated, and opened new wells in the&#xD;
hearts of that neglected and hardened class, proving that there is&#xD;
some good in all, and that there are few, if any, cases of total&#xD;
depravity.&#xD;
A few weeks later Robert Armistead united with Mr. Allen's&#xD;
church. Mr. Wilson did his best to induce him to continue his&#xD;
visits to, his house and his attendance at his church, but he had&#xD;
been so shocked by the want of Christian 'spirit which he dis-&#xD;
played. he shuddered to think of the probable.consequences had&#xD;
Mr. Allen been of the same spirit. All faith in religion might&#xD;
have been destroyed, and his brilliant mind left a prey to doubts&#xD;
and skepticism as long as he lived.&#xD;
As it was. his influence was exerted for good, and a noble and&#xD;
&#xD;
useful Christian he proved. His genuine piety and unpretending&#xD;
goodness had their effect. He preached frequently for those&#xD;
people whom others shunned, and was rewarded by their rapid&#xD;
improvement. In a year there was a neat chapel built in their&#xD;
midst, and the passer-by, who formerly heard oaths and rude&#xD;
jests, now heard the songs of Zion and saw an orderly and neat&#xD;
community. The husband of that dying woman was among the&#xD;
first whounited with the church, and Mr. Allen had the pleasure&#xD;
of baptizing him and his two infant children into the church on&#xD;
the same day.&#xD;
What of Mr. Wilson, the once popular preacher ? Not many&#xD;
months served to prove to him his sad mistake. While trying to&#xD;
steer his course so as to offend none, he forgot the precepts of his&#xD;
Divine Master, and had his reward in the very perceptible dimin-&#xD;
ution of his congregations, and the non-approvalsof those whose&#xD;
favor lie courted,&#xD;
Very uncertain are the smiles and approval of this world,&#xD;
Those of whose friendship we feel most secure are sometimes our&#xD;
most/formidable foes. Mr. Armistead's union with a church he&#xD;
was'laboring to pull down affected Mr. Wilson's popularity more&#xD;
than anything else; for, strange inconsistency ! " Brother Smith "&#xD;
was the first to taunt him with being a man-pleaser and com-&#xD;
plain of the disaffection in the church. Instead of gaining a&#xD;
dozen accessions to his church, he lost a score or more beside the&#xD;
confidence of his brethren.' Before the year closed he had be-&#xD;
come so unpopular that he was glad to leave for a distant field of&#xD;
labor, where it is to be hoped that he has found it will pay to do&#xD;
one's duty under all circumstances, regardless of the probability&#xD;
or even the certainty of what the worst persons can say of him.&#xD;
If it will pay even in this world, then how much more in the&#xD;
world to come!&#xD;

An honest tale speeds best, being plainly told."-hakspeard.&#xD;
When Alexander the Great led his host of brutal soldiery into&#xD;
the hearts of the most beautiful countries on the globe, laying&#xD;
waste fertile fields and quiet hamlets,. destroying populous cities,&#xD;
and turning thousands of widows and orphans out from shelter&#xD;
and hope, he was called a hero. Napoleon Bonaparte, fired by&#xD;
an unholy ambition-not satisfied with rising from obscurity to the&#xD;
head of the French nation, made war upon happy and inoffensive&#xD;
countries, by brute force added .kingdom after kingdom to his&#xD;
vast dominions, until the whole civilised world trembled at the&#xD;
sound of his name. For this he was called a hero.&#xD;
Joan of Arc, with a mad fanaticism, clothed in a full suit 'of&#xD;
armor. with the sword of the conqueror waving over her head,&#xD;
led a superstitious army to conquest. She was called a heroine.&#xD;
Florence Nightingale, braving fatigue, danger, even death in&#xD;
the hospitals of the Crimea, was a far nobler woman than Joan&#xD;
of Arc, and deserves the love and veneration of' all true men and&#xD;
women: but, nobler, greater is the heroism which, regardless of&#xD;
the jeers and slanders of a censorious world, can bravely pursue&#xD;
the path of duty marked out for him or her by Providence. I can&#xD;
better illustrate my meaning by a story, which can soon be told.&#xD;
Nettie Arnold was the pride of a large circle of friends, the&#xD;
only daughter of' a man of unbounded ambition, and veneration&#xD;
for learning. Her mind, naturally fine, had been thoroughly&#xD;
trained, until she had few equals in education. Add to this a&#xD;
manner unaffectedly kind and polished; a heart endowed with the&#xD;
most generous impulses, a prepossessing appearance, and a repu-&#xD;
tation above reproach, and we need .not wonder that she was&#xD;
admired and respected by all who knew her.  Zany wondered&#xD;
that she remained single ; with that we have nothing to do.' The&#xD;
years glided by, robbing her of none of her charms.&#xD;

I said she was an only daughter. True, she was the only child&#xD;
of her mother, but her father had married the second time when&#xD;
Nettle was a wee, delicate child. Her stepmother, a noble speci-&#xD;
men of that much abused class, won the heart of her sprightly&#xD;
step-daughter. Years afterV when Nettie was a young lady, this&#xD;
kind mother died, leaving her three little boys to the care of an&#xD;
ambitious and unloving father.&#xD;
Capt. Arnold was a man of whose preference one might feel&#xD;
proud, but his love was cruel in its exactions. His children&#xD;
learned to revere him for his learning, and to fear him. He put&#xD;
them to school, separating them from their sister, who gained his&#xD;
displeasure by coming between the motherless boys and his wrath.&#xD;
She was taken by a maiden aunt, but a life of luxury and fashion&#xD;
did not cause her to forget the little brothers who looked up to&#xD;
her as to a mother.&#xD;
One there was, the youngest, who especially needed a&#xD;
mother's or a sister's care. His erratic and poetic fancies erected&#xD;
a barrier between him and his father, and, in a measure, separated&#xD;
him from his-brothers. His father was extremely harsh toward&#xD;
him, frequently chastising him for some slight offence until the&#xD;
blood ran down. Ah! mistaken parent ! Love could have bent&#xD;
him to any shape, but force never. Could he change his nature&#xD;
Was it his fault that he took more pleasure in wild romances and&#xD;
strange weird poetry than in more solid learning? As well might&#xD;
the Ethiopian hope to change his skin, or the leopard his spots, as&#xD;
to try to force Edgar Arnold to think or act like other children,&#xD;
by the use of the rod or harsh words. Had his mother lived or&#xD;
his sister been permitted to superintend his education, he could&#xD;
have been led along, his mind trained, and his wild imaginings so&#xD;
tempered and directed that' he might have become a bright and&#xD;
shining light in the world of science and literature. As it was,&#xD;
he grew up, reading- voraciously everything which he could find&#xD;
suited to his taste, gleaning much that was grand and beautiful,&#xD;
while his nature was warped and his feelings distorted by the&#xD;
vicious associations which surrounded him. Not one care for the&#xD;
moral training of his children ever actuated Capt. Arnold in his&#xD;
selection of a school for them. So their heads were filled with a&#xD;
certain number of dead and~ modern languages, it mattered not&#xD;

with him that their Sabbaths were spent in fishing or hunting&#xD;
with the lowest class, and their young lips learned to frame the&#xD;
most horrid oaths.&#xD;
Ere the school days ended, while Edgar was, yet in his teens,&#xD;
the war for Southern independence began, and the three brothers&#xD;
left school to join the army. The older boys were killed in battle&#xD;
in the early part of the way. Edgar, in the school of reckless dis-&#xD;
sipation, so ruinous to many of our promising young men, which&#xD;
the army opened before him, found ample exercise for his peculiar&#xD;
talent. Brave as any mortal could be, he fought regard-ess of&#xD;
danger, until a severe wound disabled him for farther service.&#xD;
With no definite aim in life, no idea of the value of time or&#xD;
money, he became a wanderer, squandering hundreds of dollars&#xD;
as recklessly as he exposed his life in battle.&#xD;
Years passed. The war ended and left Edgar Arnold without&#xD;
fortune, and without any ideas of making a living. He wandered&#xD;
cast and west, north and south, making a little money occasion-&#xD;
ally by his wits as reporter for newspapers, auctioneer, &amp;amp;c. His&#xD;
sister, with her aunt, visited a farm belonging to the former, near&#xD;
where her father had settled ,after the war, and remained several&#xD;
months. She had heard where Edgar was and had written to&#xD;
him to meet her there. He went and remained with her until she&#xD;
returned with her aunt, when he went off to seek his fortune.&#xD;
She offered to remain on-the farm if he would settle down there&#xD;
with her. His recklessness grieved her very much. His father&#xD;
hated him because he was what he had made him, and was very&#xD;
cross with his daughter because of her affection and pity for this&#xD;
only brother.&#xD;
They left the farm to its tenants, and he was not heard of&#xD;
again for two years, when the old farm-house was fitted  up, and&#xD;
Miss Nettie Arnold and her brother, with a little babe, took pos-&#xD;
session and settled down there. 0, the babel of tongues that&#xD;
were put in motion then ! She who had been petted and flattered&#xD;
only two years ago, was now the\ subject of the vilest abuse.&#xD;
Her father fumed and fretted for one year, then died cursing his&#xD;
children, refusing to let his daughter approach him, though she&#xD;
begged to be permitted to attend him in his illness. His harsh-&#xD;
ness increased the slanders, until Miss Arnold's name was blacker&#xD;
&#xD;

han that of the vilest wretch that ever lived. She and her&#xD;
brother were accused of living in incest ; not more than one or&#xD;
two families believed-her innocent. She lived on quietly for three&#xD;
years, keeping the even tenor of her way, with no society, noth-&#xD;
ing but her books, and the little innocent committed to her care.&#xD;
Her brother seemed changed. He seemed to live but for the in-&#xD;
mates of that old farm-house. People wondered, but did not try&#xD;
to find out the truth of the stories afloat, except from the negroes&#xD;
employed on the place. Had one told them it was all false, they&#xD;
loved the morsel of slander too well to wish to believe it.- If&#xD;
Miss Arnold ever heard the scandalous stories, she did not, seem&#xD;
to notice them. If she shed bitter tears in secret, her kind (?)&#xD;
neighbors were none the wiser.&#xD;
Three years passed and new subjects satisfied the morbid appe-&#xD;
tites of the scandal-loving community. Then Edgar sought and&#xD;
obtained business in a distant county. His sister could not re-&#xD;
main there alone, so she packed up and left the farm, for her home&#xD;
with her aunt. The tempest which was thought to have subsided,&#xD;
was only lulled for a while. It broke out with fresh fury. Miss&#xD;
Arnold's departure was positive proof that she was not what she&#xD;
should be, she was running away to hide her shame. . A few who&#xD;
visited her before she left, knew better, and tried to offer their&#xD;
testimony in her behalf, but in vain. The negroes said so, and&#xD;
they knew.&#xD;
One who felt well assured of Miss Arnold's innocence made&#xD;
inquiries of friends in a town in which Edgar had resided just&#xD;
before his return with his sister to her farm, and received the&#xD;
following reply :&#xD;
Sir:-In reply to your inquiries respecting Edgar Arnold, I&#xD;
am at perfect liberty to tell a little story, which I am happy to do,&#xD;
since it will clear Miss Arnold from the stigma which her brother's&#xD;
misfortunes have fastened to her spotless name. She is a heroine,&#xD;
sir, one of the noblest specimens of womankind I ever knew&#xD;
When Edgar came to this town, five years ago, he was.re-&#xD;
porter for a newspaper published here. He was sprightly, and a&#xD;
favorite with the young ladies. As time passed he met with one,&#xD;
a beautiful milliner girl, who possessed some of his wild fancies&#xD;
and strange ideas of life, though her mind had not been culti-&#xD;

vated as his had been. She Was ignorant of the ways of the&#xD;
world, and loved him with her whole soul. lie loved her madly,&#xD;
passionately, asone of his nature is capable 'of loving but once in&#xD;
a life-time. With no definite idea of how ,he was to live, with&#xD;
no thought, of the consequences, he, with his usual impetuosity,&#xD;
gave himself up to this first dream of love. Enough that they&#xD;
loved, not wisely, but too well. A few months of delirium passed,&#xD;
and the necessity for replenishing his purse caused him to seek&#xD;
his fortunes in a far Western State. le left with the promise of&#xD;
returning and claiming his love as a bride. He had barely settled&#xD;
down to business in the far West, when a letter, sixty days old,&#xD;
reached him,-recalling him in haste to Virginia. The intelli-&#xD;
gence caused him the most intense agony. lie was far from, any&#xD;
public conveyance, and delays chafed and fretted him into a bi'ain&#xD;
fever, which brought him near to death's door. When at length&#xD;
he reached this place, a mere wreck of his former self, he found a&#xD;
new-made grave in the cemetery, and a wee baby in the poor-&#xD;
house. His remorse and agony were pitiful to behold. People&#xD;
who had blamed him, pitied him when they saw how he mourned.&#xD;
The young mother had died in the poor-house, broken-hearted,&#xD;
deserted by every friend. He was too late to repair the wrong&#xD;
done-the mother, but the helpless. infant awakened all the dor-&#xD;
mant powers of his soul. Remorse for the past and a determin-&#xD;
ation to repair the wrong as far as possible, led him to desire to&#xD;
take the little one and raise it tenderly. But he was without&#xD;
means, with no female' friend to whom he coid apply for aid ex-&#xD;
cept his sister. He feared her strong sense of propriety, her horror&#xD;
of all things wicked, would cause her to hate him and cast him&#xD;
on. But he could do nothing more than throw himself upon her&#xD;
mercy. So he wrote, detailing the circumstances in full, and in&#xD;
reply received a letter full of sympathy and promises of aid. Her&#xD;
aunt would not agree to her taking the infant to her house. She&#xD;
was not related to Edgar, and dreaded the scandal it might occa-&#xD;
sion. Miss Nettie was at the Virginia springs, in the height of&#xD;
the season of enjoyment, but she left it all. Her brother met her&#xD;
with the habe at a depot, and they hastened to that out of the&#xD;
way farm-house, where Miss Nettie has been immured as in a&#xD;
dungeon for three years, until b  health has failed so sensibly she&#xD;

WHAT NOVEL READING DID FOR ME.&#xD;
BIRDIE, RAT'S STORY.&#xD;
At eighteen I was as blithe as any bird. I went about my&#xD;
household duties singing so gayly that the pet name given to me&#xD;
in babyhood by my dear, indulgent father, clung to mle long after&#xD;
my mother told me childish things should have been put away.&#xD;
My mother was a prim, precise woman, kind-hearted in her way;&#xD;
but her way was one few understood, and fewer still liked. She&#xD;
had a rule for everything, and woe betide that person, be it&#xD;
husband, child or servant, who transgressed one of her rules or&#xD;
laws. She had taken great pains with my education, superinten-&#xD;
ding that important business herself, as she did everything else&#xD;
about the premises. Now that teachers were no longer need d, she&#xD;
undertook to make me a good housewife. I followed her until I&#xD;
could do almost-everything she could do, and she came to the con-&#xD;
clusion that I was.sufficiently wise to become mistress of an estab-&#xD;
lishment of my own. Here she was ready for me. A well-to-do&#xD;
farmer, steady and economical, bearing the very euphonious&#xD;
cognomen Tom Jones, and whose peculiar religious views just&#xD;
suited my mother, was her choice as a husband for me. I liked&#xD;
Mr. Jones well enough as a neighbor, but the idea of accepting&#xD;
him as my husband was simply absurd. He was twenty years&#xD;
my senior ; but his age was not the greatest point of difference&#xD;
between us. ' He was stern and bigoted, with no pity for erring&#xD;
humanity, and, like my mother, with no patience with any one.&#xD;
who dared to oppose his peculiar views in any matter, let it -.be&#xD;
ever so trivial. I would as soon have thought of burying myself&#xD;
alive as of uniting my destiny with that of one so directly oppo-&#xD;
site in every particular. Besides, I. had my predilections, as most&#xD;
girls of eighteen have. . Paul Clayton and I had roamed the forests&#xD;
and fields around our childhood'shome since our earliest recollec-&#xD;

tions. He had been my protector and my beau-ideal, since his&#xD;
father had died and left him to the care of my father, with a mod-&#xD;
erate fortune, which had been very nearly spent in obtaining a&#xD;
medical education, which he desired. We had grown up loving&#xD;
each other dearly, and with the tacit understanding that- we be-&#xD;
longed to each other. My father, who loved Paul as a son, en-&#xD;
couraged our affection.&#xD;
My mother was always kind to him, but he was not her idea&#xD;
of a protector for a woman. He was too young, only two years&#xD;
my senior, and was. too child-like in his affections., But the&#xD;
greatest objection was his want of fortune. Mr. Jones was one of&#xD;
the wealthiest farmers in the county. His house was well fur-&#xD;
nished, and his farm splendidly stocked. She thought me highly&#xD;
honored by his preference, and was astonished that I did not&#xD;
view the case in the same light. I laughed at the idea, until I&#xD;
found how much in earnest she was. Payl was poor in compar-&#xD;
ison with Mr. Jones, but what cared I for that ? He was at a med-&#xD;
ical college, and would come home in a few months to commence&#xD;
the practice of medicine in our neighborhood. Mother feared&#xD;
his coming, and it was her policy to have me married as soon as&#xD;
possible.&#xD;
Mr. Jones came every day to talk with my mother about the&#xD;
proper management of his dairy and poultry-yard, and to tell&#xD;
her the old, old story --how much clear cash his farm yielded&#xD;
him every year. She would tell him how rapidly I had progressed&#xD;
in my education in all useful things, what nice butter I could&#xD;
make, and what a dutiful child I was, until he thought I was just&#xD;
the wife he wanted - young, pretty, sprightly and a good house-&#xD;
keeper. 0, how I was learning to hate him! It was a bitter ex-&#xD;
perience I was passing through, and I could not love my, perse-&#xD;
cutors. The more I strove to overcome my repugnance to him,&#xD;
-the more I-hated him, until, strange and unnatural as it may&#xD;
appear, I almost hated my mother too. I pleaded with her not&#xD;
to sacrifice her only child to a life of misery. She taunted me&#xD;
with preferring that poverty-stricken medical student, and bade&#xD;
me overcome- any such feelings, as wed Mr. Jones. I must and&#xD;
should. I went to my father, and found sympathy and love, but&#xD;
he durst not counsel opposition to her will. He had yielded so&#xD;

long he did not know how to rebel now. Oh how miseralble I&#xD;
was! What should I do? If she persisted I must be Mr. Jones'&#xD;
slave.&#xD;
I cried myself to sleep that night. The next morning I wrote&#xD;
to Paul and begged him to tell me what to do ; I was to be an un-,&#xD;
willing bride in three months. In two weeks he came. lie went&#xD;
to my father and begged him to interpose his authority to save.&#xD;
his child. My father was deeply affected and promised to do what&#xD;
he could, but could give him no hope, as he had spoken to my&#xD;
mother upon the subject several times without effect. We were&#xD;
as miserable as lovers could well be under the circumstances. I&#xD;
had wept until I was almost ill, and he was trying to persuade me&#xD;
to elope with him, when Mr. Jones was announced, and my pres-&#xD;
ence was desired in the parlor, I ran to my room, bathed my&#xD;
eyes until they lost their swollen appearance, when they fell upon&#xD;
a book Paul had brought me - Marion Iarland's. first book,&#xD;
"Alone."' I took it up and turned it about in my hands mechan-&#xD;
ically. I had been too miserable to look at the name until then.&#xD;
I just then remember d that Mr. Jones tabooed all novel-reading&#xD;
as fearfully wicked-an unpardonable sin. A bright thought&#xD;
flashed upon my mind, and I went down to the parlor with the&#xD;
book in my hands, my finger between the leaves as if I had been&#xD;
reading when he came. My greeting was more cordial than&#xD;
usual, and he rubbed his lean, money-grasping fingers together&#xD;
in ecstasy. le drew his chair up to me, and attempted to take&#xD;
my hand in his, when I turned the book, partially open, so that&#xD;
the title-page might meet his eye. The movement attracted his&#xD;
attention, and he exclaimed, "Al]! what is that ? Not a novel, I&#xD;
hope'?" and he drew back as though it was a serpent. I looked&#xD;
up to him with a smile as I replied, " Yes, sir, it is a novel. You&#xD;
do not object to my reading novels, do you?" "Object to it !"&#xD;
he asked, as he rose and stood before me. "You surely do not&#xD;
read such trash? I thought your mother had trained you differ-&#xD;
ently."  I drew a long sigh and said, "I am very sorry, sir, you&#xD;
object so strongly to such reading. My father does not disapprove&#xD;
of it indeed, I read to him a great deal. I greatly prefer it to house-.&#xD;
keeping, and I have hoped that you would supply me with as&#xD;
many books as I. wish when you take me home. It will be so&#xD;
&#xD;
lonely there without novels." "Margaret," he said, very soi-&#xD;
etnnly (lie and mother always called me Margaret, everybody else&#xD;
called mne Birdie), "you do not know how very wicked it is to&#xD;
read such stuff. Your father has done wrong to encourage any&#xD;
such taste in you. But you are so young, you will soon overcome&#xD;
the desire. When other duties press upon you, you will not care&#xD;
for books, except your Bible. You will not read any more, for my&#xD;
sake, will you ? You cannot have read many ?" I looked down&#xD;
in seeming confusion, but really in triumph, as I said, so low he&#xD;
had to bend to catch the words, " Indeed, sir, I have read a good&#xD;
many. I like them, 0 so-much ! I fear I shall never cease to care for&#xD;
them. I have read ten thousand a year, and-" "Good Heavens!"&#xD;
he cried, "that is impossible ! You would not read that number&#xD;
in a life-time." I drew up indignantly, as I said, "I hope you&#xD;
do not doubt my word, sir. My father can testify to the truth of&#xD;
what I say ; more than that, I think I shall read more this year&#xD;
than I ever did before, as I have already read eighteen hundred&#xD;
and twelve, and this is only the tenth of January. My eyes are&#xD;
itching now to begin this one."&#xD;
Words are inadequate to describe his appearance. With his&#xD;
long bony fingers clutching the back of the chair, he was staring&#xD;
at me with open mouth and distended eyes until I ceased speak-&#xD;
ing, when he drew back to the other side of the room, as if he&#xD;
feared I might take forcible possession of him, soul and body.&#xD;
He seized his hat and backed himself out of the room, with his&#xD;
eyes still fixed upon me with horror. Without a. word of adieu&#xD;
he left, and was soon galloping down the road as though Beelze-&#xD;
bub were at his heels. I hastened to the library; lest mother&#xD;
should come to know the cause of Mr. Jones' abrupt departure.&#xD;
Father and Paul enjoyed the description I gave them of the in-&#xD;
terview. We were still enjoying the afternoon, with more of&#xD;
cheerfulness and hope than I had felt for a- long while, when my&#xD;
mother came in with an open ote in her hand. Her eyes were&#xD;
like blazing coals, while he; ce was deadly pale. She stood be-&#xD;
fore me, and asked, sternly, " Margaret, what did you do or say&#xD;
to offend Mr. Jones this afternoon? ". I looked her in the face,&#xD;
as I replied, calmly and respectfully, "Mother, I was very polite&#xD;
to Mr. Jones. You know I have never been more than that ;&#xD;

could not be." "Did you tell him you loved another ?" "No,&#xD;
madam, I did not." She handed the note to father, who read it,&#xD;
and with a well-simulated air of displeasure, handed it to me,&#xD;
saying, " Read that, Birdie, and see how you are jilted." I took it,&#xD;
glanced over it, then read aloud :&#xD;
"Mr. Thomas Jones declines the honor of Miss Margaret Ray's&#xD;
hand in marriage, as he has become fully satisfied of the fact that&#xD;
she does not suit him at all, and hopes her mother will consider&#xD;
the engagement at an end from date."&#xD;
It was with the greatest difficulty I could refrain from giving&#xD;
expression to my great joy in some extravagant manner. I had&#xD;
to .bury my face in my hand to conceal the joyous light of my&#xD;
eyes. As soon as I could command my voice, I looked up and&#xD;
said, "Mother, we had better sue him for breach of promise."&#xD;
"Margaret !" was all her indignation would permit her to say.&#xD;
Paul arose and went to her, and said, " Mrs.. Ray, give your&#xD;
daughter to me. You have been amother to me for ten years.&#xD;
I thank you deeply for your past kindness; grant me this greatest&#xD;
of all boons, and I will be a son indeed to you. She loves me,"&#xD;
as you well know. The wedding-day need not be changed ; we&#xD;
will only change the bridegroom. Believe me, dear mother, you&#xD;
shall never regret giving her to me." . She sank upon a chair and&#xD;
laid her head on a table before her. I knelt before her and laid&#xD;
my head on her knee. Her arm was thrown around me, and she&#xD;
said, "My dear child, I have been a harsh mother;- but God&#xD;
would not let me sacrifice you to my ambition. Take her, Paul,&#xD;
and make her happier than I would, have done."&#xD;
Years have passed, and if the reader will call at Dr. Clayton's&#xD;
residence, he will see as happy a family as can be found in this&#xD;
world. Father and mother come. to see us very frequently.&#xD;
Father is the same good, affectionate being he always was, only&#xD;
he is much happier, because of the change in mother. She is so&#xD;
much more considerate of his wishes and feelings, so much' tenderer&#xD;
and sympathetic. Between the two my little ones are in danger&#xD;
of being badly spoiled. I must bid you adieu, as Paul has come&#xD;
in to dinner, and J must not neglect him, dear, good soul that he is!&#xD;
Tom Jones has never married. Somehow the trick I played&#xD;
him was too good to be kept secret, and it reached his ears. lie&#xD;
has never forgiven me.&#xD;

suited to her tastes than Mr. Goodman. Oscar Overton was gay,&#xD;
fascinating, and a spendthrift ; yet Angelica encouraged him, and&#xD;
liked him as well as one of her selfish nature could do. But&#xD;
sober reason told her he would never do., He could not keep up&#xD;
the .style both loved so well for any length of time, as his patri-&#xD;
mony was fast disappearing from his loose grasp, while there&#xD;
would be long division of her father's estate. George Goodman&#xD;
had a good home, and everything to render any reasonable person&#xD;
happy. With his steady habits and well-known industry and&#xD;
business tact, he need not fear failure. He was the safest chance,&#xD;
and accept him she must, and did, despite the fluttering of her&#xD;
small heart.&#xD;
The wedding day came, and with it a select and gay company&#xD;
to witness' the nuptials of a pair so suited to each other, as some&#xD;
said, while others shook their heads. The groom was happy, for&#xD;
he loved his bride, and she had led him to believe' he was her&#xD;
choice of all the world, her heart's king.&#xD;
They went to their home amid the congratulations and-good&#xD;
wishes of many friends. He had spent hundreds of dollars in&#xD;
fitting up his country home for.her he loved so fondly, and he&#xD;
blindly thought she would be perfectly happy with, him, and love&#xD;
him more than ever for anticipating her wishes in so many things.&#xD;
Bitter indeed was his disappointment. She kept up a show of&#xD;
pleasure and affection until the friends who accompanied them&#xD;

home had departed. Then her true disposition was revealed.&#xD;
Her husband found that his purse was his chief attraction in the&#xD;
eyes of his wife. He did all he could to please her, but that was&#xD;
an impossibility. Industry, piety, and a love of home had wedded&#xD;
pride, selfishness, and a love of display.  Of. course there&#xD;
could be no happiness in such a union. Constant fretting and&#xD;
fault-finding left their traces, and her beauty soon vanished.&#xD;
After many vain efforts to make her at least satisfied with her lot,&#xD;
George Goodman turned to his farm and stock for diversion,&#xD;
trying to bear with resignation the miserable fate of a loveless&#xD;
existence.&#xD;
SWe need not look far for another example. Edward Gay is&#xD;
handsome, and has large expectations., Ie has a dashing style&#xD;
about him which is very attractive to many young ladies, dresses&#xD;
elegantly and travels in splendid style, has plenty of ready money&#xD;
which he spends freely. Strange to tell, he chooses his opposite&#xD;
in every respect except in fortune; and, stranger still, Mary&#xD;
Moore, who has known him from childhood, knows all his&#xD;
crooked ways, loves him, and society in general cries out "A&#xD;
very suitable match."&#xD;
Time passes swiftly amid the hurry and confusion of prepa-&#xD;
tions for a big wedding.&#xD;
They are united in bonds which should be holy, but are any-&#xD;
thing elsetin the estimation of the bridegroom. The bride is&#xD;
lovely in face, form and character, and he fancies that he loves&#xD;
her. He will be very devoted until the novelty of his new rela-&#xD;
tion wears off, which will not be long, for a man so void of true&#xD;
nobility of soul, so wedded to sinful pleasures, cannot be con-&#xD;
tented long without indulgence. God pity the sweet young bride !&#xD;
So pure, so loving, her beauty, grace and accomplishments wasted&#xD;
upon one so unworthy !&#xD;
It is anything but strange that her cheeks grow pale, and her&#xD;
step, so buoyant only a few short months ago, should grow weary&#xD;
and slow, or that she seeks her mother's loving heart for comfort&#xD;
ed affection.&#xD;
Of all the sad situations in life, this must be the saddest. Yet we&#xD;
see .it so frequently. How few are the really matched, and how&#xD;
very many the mismatched couples that go out to begin life as&#xD;
one in heart and purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
MISMA TCIIED.                      129&#xD;
I do not oppose matrimony - nay, I believe a happy marriage&#xD;
is a state more nearly approximating heaven than any other can&#xD;
be ;. yet I would warn my young friends to look well before you&#xD;
enter that state. Try to be equally yoked.- Let fortune be the&#xD;
least consideration.&#xD;

CHAPTER I.&#xD;
Mr. Conrad was one of the wealthiest merchants of Charleston.&#xD;
His family consisted of himself, his wife (a showy woman of the&#xD;
world), his daughter (a gay and exceedingly fashionable young&#xD;
lady of sixteen), and his orphan niece, Clare Conrad, the only&#xD;
child of a beloved brother, who died when she was very young,&#xD;
leaving his motherless little girl to the care of his wealthy and&#xD;
kind-hearted brother. The little property he left her was barely&#xD;
sufficient to afford her the education he coveted for his sprightly&#xD;
child.&#xD;
Mrs. Conrad insisted that it was a useless waste of her little&#xD;
patrimony to send Clare'; to the best- schools. If she could be&#xD;
taught the rudiments of english it would Dbe amply sufficient ;&#xD;
but her husband disagreed with her, and his niece shared every&#xD;
advantage so lavishly bestowed upon his petted daughter. At the&#xD;
'early age of sixteen they were considered finished by the faculty&#xD;
of a fashionable female college.&#xD;
Cora Conrad, the petted child of fortune, possessed a quick&#xD;
mind, and would have made a brilliant scholar but for her indo-&#xD;
lence, and for having been humored to so great an extent by her&#xD;
mother. Clare had assisted her with her lessons, and stimulated'&#xD;
her to a little exertion by appeals to her pride, so that she con-&#xD;
trived by some means to be pushed through the course, and re-&#xD;
ceived"her diploma at the same time that Clare graduated with&#xD;
honpr.&#xD;
Clare was a natural student. She sought knowledge because&#xD;

she loved it ; and despite her poverty, became the favorite of her&#xD;
teachers and classmates whom she iielped out of many a difficulty&#xD;
by her ready wit. Unlike many hard students, she was the picture&#xD;
of health and happiness. Her summer vacations had been spent&#xD;
with her mother's sister in Virginia. The three months spent&#xD;
with her uncle and-aunt Berkley, on the old Virginia farm, were&#xD;
bright spots in the life of the imaginative and nature-loving child,&#xD;
and her visits were ever a source of pleasure to the inmates of&#xD;
the farm-house and their neighbors.&#xD;
At the opening of my story the two girls had left school and&#xD;
were ready to enter society as young ladies. Cora was a proud&#xD;
beauty, whose fortune made Sher an object of particular interest&#xD;
to a host of young men, and her advent was hailed with delight&#xD;
by the votaries of fashion.  rs. 'onrad, to whom her husband&#xD;
left the matter of dress, did ot think it incumbent upon her to&#xD;
spend so much money upon a   or orphan as.she did upon her&#xD;
own daughter ; consequently, she could not go into society upon&#xD;
the same footing. Our little student had too much pride to force&#xD;
herself forward, and when her uncle asked why she did not ac-&#xD;
company her aunt and cousin when they went out, or appear in&#xD;
the parlor more frequently, she gave as a reason that she liked&#xD;
better to stay with him, or to read in her own room when he was&#xD;
out. She was so young and petite, no one thought she was as old&#xD;
or as learned as Cora, and she was not missed.&#xD;
When Mrs. Conrad and Cora started to Saratoga, Mr. Conrad&#xD;
insisted that Clare should accompany them; but mudh as she de-&#xD;
sired to see Niagara, which they would visit,'she saw too plainly&#xD;
that her aunt did not wish her to go ; therefore she declined, and&#xD;
stopped, as usual, with her relatives in Virginia.&#xD;
Mrs. Conrad had hinted to her frequently, that as so much of&#xD;
her property had been spent upon her education, she ought to&#xD;
obtain a situation as teacher, so as to be independent of her rela-&#xD;
tives. She had spent many hours planning the future, all the&#xD;
while busy with her books, so as to be competent to fill a posi-&#xD;
tion, should she be so fortunate as to find one. When she left&#xD;
Charleston she had fully determined to remain with the Berkleys&#xD;
until she could find employment, knowing that she would find a&#xD;
welcome there. Her aunt had two little daughters old enough to&#xD;
be at school; she would insure a welcome by teaching them.&#xD;

&#xD;
Cora loved Clare better than she did any one else, and better&#xD;
than everything except her own ease, and really wished her to&#xD;
accompany her, since Clare bad such an exquisite taste in dress&#xD;
and knew instinctively what suited her style, thereby saving her&#xD;
any thought upon the subject. Then she was so plain and unpre-&#xD;
tending, there was no danger of rivalry. True, she was the wisest&#xD;
little body she knew ; a great deal smarter than herself; but she'&#xD;
was too modest to push herself forward, and no one would ever&#xD;
suspect- her of being a walking cyclopedia.&#xD;
For once she was denied the privilege of having her own way,&#xD;
but promised to write occasionally and tell Clare everything that&#xD;
occurred...&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER II.&#xD;
Let us look in upon the family at," Solitude," in the interior of&#xD;
the Old Dominion. Everything upon the farm presents the&#xD;
appearance of thrift,,and intelligence. The yard is a pattern of&#xD;
beauty and order. The house is commodious and built more for&#xD;
comfort than show, painted white, with green blinds, and almost&#xD;
covered with honeysuckles, jasmines and roses.-&#xD;
Merry peals of laughter from the dining-room draw us irresis-&#xD;
tibly in that direction, and we stand unperceived upon the long&#xD;
porch and look through the low window, seeing as happy a group&#xD;
as it has ever been our good fortune to look upon.&#xD;
Mr. Berkley, a noble-looking - man, apparently about forty&#xD;
years of age, sits with an open letter in his hand, which seems to&#xD;
afford food for the merriment which evidently reigns to the ex-&#xD;
clusion of the inviting supper spread before them. Glare has two&#xD;
letters and a package of papers, but has not broken the seal of&#xD;
either. Let us see what it is that amuses them so. We cannot&#xD;
do better than read it out:,&#xD;
Dear Uncle Alf: What shall I do ? Here I am. at Saratoga'&#xD;
with a party from New York, looking for pleasure, and -finding&#xD;
rooms crowded to suffocation, &amp;amp;c., &amp;amp;c., ad infinitum - anything,&#xD;
in fact, but pleasure. Some seem to enjoy it, but I can't.. I am&#xD;

&#xD;
sick of it all: The parlors are crowded with the beauty of the&#xD;
United States. I am accustomed to fashionable society, but am&#xD;
particularly loaded with ennui this season. When I leave my&#xD;
office in the city I want rest for body and mind, not the whirl of&#xD;
a fashionable watering-place. .I scarcely know whether I am&#xD;
standing on my head or myheels.&#xD;
The newest sensation is a young authoress from Charleston.&#xD;
She has burst upon the reading public as suddenly as the flash of&#xD;
a meteor, and as brightly. .1 am forced to acknowledge there is&#xD;
power and beauty in her writings. She writes sketches and poems&#xD;
for a leading New York paper. If I had not seen the authoress&#xD;
here, the gayest of the gay in dress, but really too lazy to try to&#xD;
make herself agreeable, or to let people hear her say some of the&#xD;
pretty things she writes so gracefully, I could go into raptures&#xD;
over her articles.&#xD;
But for the unvarying ink-drop on her middle finger, and the&#xD;
lateness of her appearance in the morning, you would never sup-&#xD;
pose this authoress ever handled a pen. I'have always had a&#xD;
horror of literary women, and no fortune nor beauty could induce&#xD;
me to make such a woman my wife. I believe I forgot to tell you&#xD;
her name. She is a Miss Conrad, from Charleston, very wealthy&#xD;
and a beauty. She writes over the initials C. C. But enough of&#xD;
this. I write.to tell you I shall be with you at " Solitude " by&#xD;
the 15th instant. The very name is suggestive of freedom from&#xD;
pert misses, manoeuvring mammas and authoresses. With much&#xD;
love to aunt Clara and the children,&#xD;
I am, as ever, your terribly bored,&#xD;
But affectionate nephew,&#xD;
HARRY PAGE.&#xD;
" What do you think- of my gallant nephew, Clare ?" asked&#xD;
Mr. Berkley, as he folded the letter.&#xD;
"o, uncle Alfred ! I was only waiting permission to speak, to&#xD;
say'I am very sorry he's coming. I. shall be so afraid of shocking&#xD;
his sensibilities. Nettie and I can never climb another fruit tree,&#xD;
or ride after the cows, or even laugh loud again after his lordship&#xD;
appears. Are you not sorry, Nettie ?" she asked, with a smile&#xD;
lurking around the corners of her mouth.&#xD;

Nettie looked up with astonishment.&#xD;
"No, I am real glad. You don't know cousin Harry. - He is&#xD;
the ' darlingest' cousin in the world except you, and I am deter-&#xD;
mined you shall like him. 0, cousin Clare, he will climb the big&#xD;
pear tree for us. He was here for a week last winter, and he&#xD;
snow-balled with us children, just like he was one of us; and he&#xD;
is so handsome, and laughs as loud and as much as anybody. 0&#xD;
we had a jolly time when he was here. I am glad, ain't you,&#xD;
Minnie ?"&#xD;
Mrs. Berkley expressed her pleasure also at the promised visit.&#xD;
Glare. said she was hungry after having been busy drying&#xD;
fruit and making preserves all day, so they turned to the supper&#xD;
table, talking all the while, and doing justice to the cook's su-&#xD;
perior qualities.&#xD;
After the meal was partaken of, Clare said she would read&#xD;
her letters. Perhaps she might find something from Saratoga&#xD;
also. The first was from her uncle, a kind, fatherly letter, full of&#xD;
regrets at her absence, and of hopes that she was enjoying her-&#xD;
self. Then came what she was looking for, an account .of his'&#xD;
visit to the editor of the  '-, of New York, and his acceptance&#xD;
of her ai-ticles, with the hope that she would favor him with some&#xD;
more of the same sort, and making her an- offer of a stated sum&#xD;
per month for regular contributions. He had never known so&#xD;
much talent displayed by one so young. 0, how the blood leaped&#xD;
in her veins, how her heart beat, and the hot flush mounted to&#xD;
cheek and brow. 'This was more than she had dared to dream of.&#xD;
Mrs. Berkley noticed. the excitement 'under which she was&#xD;
laboring, and asked what it all meant. She passed the letter to&#xD;
her, then going around to where she sat, dropped on the floor,&#xD;
and put her head on her knee,.as she said, "Read it, dear Auntie.&#xD;
I am so proud and so happy."1&#xD;
Mrs. Berkley read the letter and handed it to her husband,&#xD;
saying, "I am astonished beyond measure. Why, Clare, who&#xD;
would have thought my happy-hearted little niece an authoress?&#xD;
And it is you, not Cora, who wrote those articles Harry compli-&#xD;
mented so much. The same initials too. How small it seems in&#xD;
her, to wish to rob my little girl of her honors. How surprised&#xD;
Harry will be to find he has run away from a supposed authoress&#xD;
to meet the real one here in his retreat."&#xD;
&#xD;
~11&#xD;

&#xD;
Clare.started up. "But, Auntie, you must not -tell him. Let&#xD;
him think me only a wild, happy child. I would not spoil his&#xD;
enjoyment of 'Solitude' for anything. Let him still think Cora&#xD;
the writer of those articles. I think we can prove to him that a&#xD;
writer need not be such.a bore, nor need she carry an ink-spot on&#xD;
her finger as an insignia of her profession. I have written&#xD;
several articles since I have been with you, and you have not sus-&#xD;
pected it. Please, auntie, and you, uncle, don't tell him. Let him&#xD;
find it out himself. I only wish to teach him a lesson."&#xD;
The required promise was given, and she opened and read&#xD;
her letters while her uncle and aunt looked over the papers and&#xD;
found the articles mentioned by Harry Page.&#xD;
Clare's other letter was from Cora, the first she had written.&#xD;
It was tolerably long for her to write, and gave a gloomy account&#xD;
of her pleasures at her hotel; but the main feature of the letter&#xD;
was an extravagant eulogium of a Mr. Page, from Richmond,&#xD;
Virginia, who was there with some friends from New York. He&#xD;
was described to be as handsome as Apollo, and as wise as all the&#xD;
philosophers and sages together. "I wish you could see him,&#xD;
Clare," she wrote, "and the strangest part is, some one is writing&#xD;
for a New York paper over my initials, and the rumor has gone&#xD;
abroad that the beautiful and wealthy Miss Conrad, of Charleston,&#xD;
is the author. Those are the very words. Mr. Page thinks it is&#xD;
true, and I am so anxious to please him, until I can get him to&#xD;
love me for something else than my wisdom. I can't say that I&#xD;
love him; I believe I am too indolent for any strong feeling, but&#xD;
I like him much. more than any one else I have ever met with.&#xD;
0, Clare, only think of my putting ink on my finger every morn-&#xD;
ing, when these are the first lines I have written since I left&#xD;
home. I think I hear you exclaim, ' Really, Cora' must be in&#xD;
love !'&#xD;

CHAPTER III.&#xD;

daughter Mimile had ridden over to the depot to get the mail.&#xD;
Mrs. Berkley was very busy in the dining-room. Nettie was dec-&#xD;
orating the mantels with fresh flowers, all the while talking about&#xD;
"cousin Harry," who was expected on the early morning train,&#xD;
and would be there before she could have time to cut fresh flowers&#xD;
in the morning. Little Alfred,"a pretty, sprightly boy of two years,&#xD;
was begging " tousin Tare" to run wnth him. The last cake had&#xD;
been brought in and pronounced " fit for the President." Without&#xD;
waiting to unpin her sleeves, or let down her curls, which were&#xD;
pinned back very carelessly, to keep them out of her way while'&#xD;
at work, Clare caught up the child and began to waltz with him&#xD;
on her shoulder, all the while humming a favorite waltz., Once&#xD;
she stopped and said to heraunt, "Don't be afraid of my hurting&#xD;
Allie. I feel full of frolic this evening, as it is to be my last day&#xD;
of freedom for some time. By the way, auntie, did Mr., Page&#xD;
never hear of your niece ?"..&#xD;
"Yes, the children talked about you so much when he was&#xD;
here last, he said he was really jealous of ' that cousin Clare.'&#xD;
" Well, then, is it not strange that he should have written so&#xD;
freely about Cora, if he knew, t at I was a Conrad, and from&#xD;
Charleston? How did he know bt t she was your niece? I begin&#xD;
to think he is ill-natured or impolite," and she stood patting her&#xD;
foot, as she looked down seriously.&#xD;
Mrs. Berkley replied, " My dear, I don't think Harry knows&#xD;
that you are a Conrad. The children spoke of you as cousin Clare,&#xD;
and Mr. Berkley merely told' him- you were my niece, without&#xD;
'giving your full name. I am sure.he would not say or write any-&#xD;
thing he thought would wound my feelings."&#xD;
"Well, auntie, I want you to introduce me to him as Miss&#xD;
Conrad, of Charleston, South Carolina. Be sure to say it all, now,&#xD;
that's a .dear, good auntie. But Alhie is impatient for another&#xD;
dance, so here goes.".&#xD;
She flew around the room with thechild laughing and clingig&#xD;
to her neck, nor stopped until she ran into the arms of a gentle-&#xD;
man who had entered the room unperceived, and was standing&#xD;
near the door. Twilight was gathering fast and objects were not&#xD;
very distinct, so he was a little excusable for folding his arms&#xD;
around her and kissing her rosy lips twice before he released her,&#xD;
as he said:&#xD;

.44&#xD;
"x&#xD;
&#xD;
"Why, Nettie, how you have grown; just as wild as ever&#xD;
though. That is right, be happy as long as possible."&#xD;
But, surely that could not be Nettie. How she withdrew from&#xD;
his arms, and, after a look of surprise and indignation, ran from&#xD;
the room. In the hall she met her uncle and Minnie, and was&#xD;
hurrying past them when Alfred called "Papa," and refused to go&#xD;
farther. She stopped to relinquish the child, when Mr. Berkley&#xD;
got a sight of her face, and said, " Why, bless the child! What&#xD;
is the matter, Clare ? Have you seen a ghost ?"&#xD;
Just then Harry Page, for he it was, as my reader has doubt-&#xD;
less guessed, came forward and said, " I thought it was Nettie,&#xD;
and must have frightened her by my affectionate greeting. It is&#xD;
Miss Henry, I suppose, Minnie's cousin Clare."&#xD;
Mrs. Berkley came forward then and said : "This is my&#xD;
niece, Miss Clare Conrad, of Charleston, South Carolina. But,&#xD;
Harry, how did you get here without letting us know you were&#xD;
coming? We looked for you on the morning train."&#xD;
Harry hastened to expl in that he got too impatient, and came&#xD;
twelve hours sooner than he intended when he wrote and having&#xD;
met his uncle very opportunely at the depot, came out in his&#xD;
buggy. He was very sorry he had so surprised and frightened&#xD;
Miss Conrad. He hoped she would not bear malice against him,&#xD;
but prove herself the kind-hearted cousin Minnie had been so&#xD;
lavishly praising on their way home. He turned to where he had&#xD;
seen her standing, but she was gone.&#xD;
An hour later when the supper bell rang, she came from her&#xD;
room looking like a subdued fairy. Mr. Page thought he had&#xD;
never seen so complete a metamorphosis. He had not thought it&#xD;
possible that so child-like a person could assume so much dignity.&#xD;
She was very simply, yet tastefully arrayed in white muslin, with&#xD;
a blue ribbon around her neck and another twined among her&#xD;
auburn ringlets. Her dark blue eyes had a deeper lustre, and a&#xD;
perceptible flush mantled her cheek, as she took the seat assigned&#xD;
her at table, directly opposite the person she wished to shun--&#xD;
Mr. Harry Page. She could not resist the temptation to raise&#xD;
her eyes once as she took her seat, but, encountering such an ear-&#xD;
nest, serious gaze from a pair of magnificent black eyes, her lids&#xD;
dropped immediately, while the long lashes touched her cheek,&#xD;

and were not raised again until, the meal was nearly concluded,&#xD;
when Mr. Berkley said :&#xD;
" You have not asked me a word about the mail, Clare. Have&#xD;
you forgotten your papers ?"&#xD;
She raised her eyes quickly enough now, and took the papers&#xD;
and a letter from her uncle. She smiled as she saw the familiar&#xD;
chirography, and said " from Saratoga." Mrs. Berkley asked if&#xD;
it was from Cora.&#xD;
"0, no," she said, " it is from uncle William. ;j suppose Cora&#xD;
is too busy writing for the press to think of me more than -once a&#xD;
month.'&#xD;
She looked up at Mr.. Page, and was pleased to note the effect,&#xD;
of her words. He bit his lip, while the hot blood rushed to ,his&#xD;
forehead, and he did not raise his eyes from his plate. She&#xD;
lingered until- the gentlemen had repaired to the veranda, then&#xD;
she read her uncle's affectionate letter. Her perverse spirit which&#xD;
had possessed her so unnaturally, vanished, and when Mrs. B.&#xD;
had assisted in clearing away the supper table, and had seen&#xD;
Minnie to bed, she accompanied her to the parlor, where they&#xD;
were joined by the gentlemen.&#xD;
Henry Page was a true-gentleman, and beneath the easy grace&#xD;
of his manner and conversation Clare forgot her own embarrass-&#xD;
ment, and found herself talking and laughing as naturally as&#xD;
though no one was present except the home circle, and when she&#xD;
was requested to sing, she complied without hesitation. She pos-&#xD;
sessed a sweet, flexible voice, and nothing suited her so well as a&#xD;
simple ballad, in which Harry joined with a splendid tenor. It&#xD;
was late ere they separated that night. As the good nights were&#xD;
repeated, Harry said, with a look of wishful entreaty :&#xD;
"I hope Miss Conrad does not cherish any ill feeling toward&#xD;
me for my very unceremonious greeting this evening, or for my&#xD;
remarks relative to her cousin. You must think me very ill&#xD;
natured and unmannerly to write such things, but I had not the&#xD;
most remote idea that Miss Cora Conrad was, in any way, con-&#xD;
nected with a member of aunt Clara's family. You were always&#xD;
spoken of as 'cousin Clare' by the children, and I supposed you&#xD;
were the daughter of aunt's brother, and bore her maiden name.&#xD;
Can you forgive me and let say cousin Clare, too ? Miss Conrad&#xD;
&#xD;
IN THE COUNTRY.&#xD;
&#xD;
is so stiff, and has such an unpleasant association since my un-&#xD;
happy faux pa."&#xD;
She gave him her hand with a smile and a pleasant "1 good&#xD;
night," and he retired to dream of a pair of dark eyes raised to&#xD;
his in frightened wonder as he clasped a flying figure in his arms.&#xD;
Days passed. One- two weeks passed, and still he lingered.&#xD;
"Solitude " was so pleasant a place he could not tear himself&#xD;
away. "Cousin Harry " was the companion of all the rambles.&#xD;
It was he who climbed the trees and shook down the ripe fruit;&#xD;
he who. pulled down the clusters of grapes which were too high&#xD;
for the girls to reach. He accompanied them in all their rides,&#xD;
and sat with them while they sewed, or busied themselves about&#xD;
household affairs. Clare was a capital hand at making pies, pick-&#xD;
ling and preserving, and her hands were frequently stained with&#xD;
fruit, though an ink-drop was never seen on her finger.&#xD;
-" C. C.'s" articles were read and freely commented on each&#xD;
week. Clare's .criticisms were more free and severe than any&#xD;
other, and Harry was struck with the- correctness and force of&#xD;
her comments. He found himself very frequently thinking that&#xD;
Clare wag much more sensible, and seemed to think more deeply&#xD;
and correctly than the author of these articles did. How could&#xD;
.Cora Conrad write so very differently from the way she conversed&#xD;
and acted; and how could she portray country life as her last&#xD;
article did, when she was too indolent to enjoy it, if she ever&#xD;
really was in the country ? It was an enigha he was unable to&#xD;
solve.&#xD;
A month had passed, and business calls were imperative. He&#xD;
must leave on the morrow. He asked Clare to walk with him to&#xD;
the grove, a favorite place of resort. They proceeded to the edge&#xD;
of the wood, where they could sit and see the sun sinking behind&#xD;
a distant mountain peak, leaving a track of crimson and gold&#xD;
upon which Clare gazed in rapt adoration, unmindful of any&#xD;
presence save that beauty which she worshipped, and she mur-&#xD;
mured softly,&#xD;
&#xD;
"The day becomes more solemnand serene&#xD;
When noon Is past: there is harmony&#xD;
In autumn and a lustre in the sky,&#xD;
Which, through the summer is not heard nor seen,&#xD;

A slight movement caused her to remember thas sheo was not&#xD;
alone. With a slight flush she turned, and said: "I do dearly&#xD;

She dropped her face upon her hands, which hed  ld, Hed&#xD;
the hot tears forced their way through the closed lids. He&#xD;
felt them upon his hand, and instantly oneh arm was around her,&#xD;
and-her head pillowed on his breast, while he told her how truly&#xD;
and devotedly he loved her. She waste her head and spoke&#xD;
ever loved, or desired to call his. She raised h&#xD;
so low he had to bend his head to listen.&#xD;
"But you will hate me w f I tell you how I have deceived&#xD;

more than I can tell. I am very sorry I deceived you, and I hope&#xD;
you will not hate me when you are gone."&#xD;
She would have' withdrawn from his arms, but he drew her&#xD;
closer, and raised her blushing face and placed upon her quiver-&#xD;
ing lips the first kiss of love.&#xD;
"That is for deceiving me so," he said. "Who would have&#xD;
thought I was in love with an authoress? Yet it is even so, and&#xD;
I would not have you other than you are, for the world. You&#xD;
say you are not a beauty. Know, little one, that you are to me&#xD;
the loveliest object on earth. Who could see that well-poised&#xD;
head and look into those eyes so full of intelligence and goodness,&#xD;
and not call you beautiful? Your cousin's queen-like figure and&#xD;
lazy hauteur sink into insignificance before your superior beauty."&#xD;
But, reader, we are de trop.&#xD;
The announcement of the engagement did not surprise Mr.&#xD;
and Mrs. Berkley in the least. It was no more than they ex-&#xD;
pected, and just what they wished. Mrs. Berkley asked him how&#xD;
he reconciled such a state of things with his former ideas con-&#xD;
cerning literary women. He replied that Clare had taught him&#xD;
that domestic industry and literature were not incompatible; that&#xD;
one may be an authoress and know how to economise and con-&#xD;
duct a home; also, that to write sound, healthy articles, one must&#xD;
enjoy nature and keep a healthy mind in a healthy body, by a-&#xD;
cheerful disposition, a good heart and a plenty of exercise.&#xD;
Clare was so young, her aunt agreed with her that it was best&#xD;
to wait a year before she became Mrs. Page. Harry urged a&#xD;
.speedy union, but was overruled, and had to wait until the next&#xD;
summer. Mr. Conrad would not hear to Clare's spending, the&#xD;
winter in Virginia; she must spend the last winter of single bless-&#xD;
edness with him. She went to him in December, and was quite&#xD;
a lioness in the literary world. She received-compliments enough&#xD;
to turn her head, had she been more fond of flattery than she was ;&#xD;
but she passed through the gayety of a winter in that gay city&#xD;
without change, and when the next June, Harry claimed her as&#xD;
his bride, she was just as innocent and childlike in her simple&#xD;
goodness as when first he met her.&#xD;

a short while to sound the depth of Mr. Montgomery's mind. He&#xD;
talked and questioned, without any apparent design, adroitly&#xD;
drawing out his visitor, until he knew just how shallow he was.&#xD;
When tea was announced Mr. Harper led the way, saying he&#xD;
supposed Lula would meet them at the table, as she was his house-&#xD;
keeper.- She did. so, looking very sweetly. There was a bright&#xD;
spot on either cheek, which her father noticed, and said, " I fear&#xD;
you are not well, Lula. You have hardly been youi-self for several&#xD;
days, I do not wish my little girl to get ill. We will leave this&#xD;
dull old house, and spend a few weeks in visiting, some friends,&#xD;
together with a week or so at Newport. By that time you will&#xD;
want rest and quiet, and I propose leaving you at Madame Know-&#xD;
all's seminary for young ladies until you finish your education. . I&#xD;
have neglected my poor, motherless darling long enough." "In-&#xD;
deed, dear father, " she replied, " I have not been neglected ; I&#xD;
have had teachers who instructed me in all things I wished to&#xD;
learn, besides you are the best and most patient of teachers. I&#xD;
cannot leave you here alone, indeed I cannot."-&#xD;
"I will not be alone. The servants will do their duty, and I&#xD;
will get my sister Mary to stay with me. You have roamed over&#xD;
this old house, reading everything you can find, long enough.&#xD;
You are old enough now to feel and know the value of education,&#xD;
and I wish you to be behind no lady in solid learning or. in ac-&#xD;
complishments.- I know ny-daughter regards her father'swishes&#xD;
too well to offer any serious objections. I have long intended&#xD;
this, but have neglected it, thinking it was time enough. I have&#xD;
decided that you must go in a short while. We will go to see&#xD;
your aunt Mary, and she will return with me."&#xD;
Lula said nothing, but looked toward her admirer for defence.&#xD;
He smiled at her, then turned to his host and said, "It is impos-&#xD;
sible, sir, to gild refined gold. This neighborhood would lose one&#xD;
of its chief attractions, in fact its brightest star, if your daughter&#xD;
leaves it. I have an opportunity to know, sir, and I can confi-&#xD;
dently affirm that there is not ,a better educated young lady in&#xD;
the county. What more could you wish than that she have no&#xD;
superior?" Politeness restrained the words that arose to the lips&#xD;
of the father, and he said nothing more. Lula was not pleased&#xD;
with her lover's boldness, and did not like the look of her father's&#xD;

eyes as he turned to her, when they arose from the table, and&#xD;
said, " You can retire, Lula; I think you are not well enough to&#xD;
sit up late to-night. We will excuse you." Lula retired to her&#xD;
room, and soon saw her lover galloping away, while her father&#xD;
closed the doors. Soon he retired to his room, and all was quiet&#xD;
in the house.&#xD;
She sat long and sadly gazed abroad, thinking she was very&#xD;
unhappy, but resolved to tell her father of her love, and she felt&#xD;
sure that he who had never denied her any gratification of her&#xD;
wishes, would not be rash with her now, when lifelong happiness&#xD;
was concerned. She pondered upon how she was to tell hin.&#xD;
She had been motherless from infancy. Her father had loved the&#xD;
little helpless girl committed to his care by her dying mother too&#xD;
entirely to seek another mistress of his fortune. No mother could&#xD;
have been more tender, and never mother possessed the confidence&#xD;
of her daughter more than he possessed hers. Yet this was a&#xD;
happiness so new. She would have gone to him that evening&#xD;
and told him all but for his strange treatment of her lover. Sleep&#xD;
did not visit her eyelids until near morning, when her slumhbers&#xD;
were disturbed by unpleasant dreams.&#xD;
At breakfast she met her father, looking so pale and weary he&#xD;
was really uneasy. As soon as they left the table he asked her to&#xD;
go with him to the library. When they were seated, he put his&#xD;
arm around her and drew her head upon his breast, as he said,&#xD;
"Will not my darling tell her father what it is that troubles her?"&#xD;
She replied by a gush of tears only. He let her sob awhile, then&#xD;
he said, "I have been very wrong, my child, to look on you and&#xD;
see your young heart going out to this stranger, without a word&#xD;
of warning. - I have thought of you only as a.child too young and&#xD;
childlike to love any but your father. Lula, dearest, you know I&#xD;
love you above all the world. Your father's love has never failed&#xD;
you, and he would cut his tongue out sooner than say anything&#xD;
to wound you if it were not necessary. Listen to- me, Lula.&#xD;
This man who has so charmed your innocent heart is shallow and&#xD;
vain. I have watched and sounded him; I believe he is an un-&#xD;
principled fortune-hunter. This is not very complimentary to&#xD;
my sweet child, I know, but it is because I know you deserve a&#xD;
better fate than a union with such a man. I warn you, and beg&#xD;

you to listen to me now. I will not tell you that you shall not&#xD;
accept his love, but 1 beg you to refuse him." " o, father, it is&#xD;
unlike you to judge so harshly. You do not know how much&#xD;
he loves me. All mn n, young men particularly, have not your&#xD;
wisdom. If he is a stranger, we know his family. It is as old and&#xD;
good as ours." The father's heart was sorely troubled, yet true&#xD;
affection for his child urged him to do his duty, and he kissed her&#xD;
pure brow as he replied, "I know you think, now, that your life&#xD;
would be worthless without his love. I will not ask you to reject&#xD;
him, but I 'have several reasons for insisting that you shall ncot&#xD;
marry under five years. Your mother was too young and fragile&#xD;
when I married, and her life was the forfeit. 'You are one year&#xD;
younger than she was, and just as frail. For the sake of your&#xD;
own precious life and health I have always intended to keep you&#xD;
if possible from an early marriage. That is one reason ; another&#xD;
is, that in five years from this time you will have seen more of&#xD;
the world. Your mind will have expanded, and what seems per-&#xD;
fection to you now will then seem very imperfect. When you&#xD;
see him again, tell him that your father will not consent to your&#xD;
marriage with any one under five years ; and should you disregard&#xD;
his wishes in a matter so vitally important he will find another,&#xD;
heir to his property, and you will not receive one cent." "0,&#xD;
father, father, you are cruel to threaten me so !" she cried, as she&#xD;
raised her head from his breast. "lHe does not care for wealth;&#xD;
he would wed me-without a cent." "If he takes you in defiance&#xD;
of my wishes he will certainly have to take you without a cent of&#xD;
my property. You know that when I tell you anything posi-&#xD;
t'ely I will not change. You can' tell him so."  She retired,&#xD;
weeping, to her room, while her father sat long in sadness, pon-&#xD;
dering over his daughter's troubles.&#xD;
Soon a visitor was announced, and Mr. Harper was surprised&#xD;
to see Mr. Montgomery. He had not expected him so soon. His&#xD;
business, this morning, was -not with Miss Harper, but with her&#xD;
father. He came to tell Mr. Harper of the great love he entertained&#xD;
for his daughter ; in fact, it would be impossible' to live without her.&#xD;
He believed he had won the priceless treasure of her love, and&#xD;
would guard it through life as a sacred trust.. He spoke very&#xD;
confidently, as if he felt no fear of refusal. He would have to "&#xD;

&#xD;
return to the city in about six weeks, and wished to take her with&#xD;
him as his bride. Mr. Harper listened quietly uutil he got through,&#xD;
then politely, yet positively refused his consent to his daughter's&#xD;
marrying any one under five years. " If you love her as you say&#xD;
you do, you can wait that length of time. If at the expiration&#xD;
of five years she is willing to marry you, and you are worthy of&#xD;
her, I give my free consent, but not until then."&#xD;
Lula heard that he was with her father and went out in the&#xD;
grove to wait for him. When he left the house he wore a frown&#xD;
upon his unusually smooth brow, which disappeared as he saw&#xD;
her coming to meet him. There were traces of 'tears on her&#xD;
cheelks, and he kissed. the sad face as he said, " We will be happy,&#xD;
dearet, in spite of your father. He has an. insane idea in his&#xD;
head that you must not marry under five years. Go with me, and&#xD;
we will be as happy as the days are long. Don't shake your&#xD;
head so dolefully, nay pretty, timid birdie. His anger will soon&#xD;
blow over ; he loves you too well to be angry long. When you&#xD;
are once all' my own, he will be sorry for his prohibition and&#xD;
come to see you." "No, no, Julian, I know my father better&#xD;
than you do. Dearly as he loves me, he would never forgive an&#xD;
act of wilful disobedience, He says, if I disregard his wishes in&#xD;
this matter he will give the whole of his property to some one&#xD;
else, not One cent shall I have. Of course you, do not care for&#xD;
the property, dear Julian; but I shall be very miserable with My&#xD;
father's anger. He has never been unkind to me before, and I&#xD;
believe he really thinks he has my interests at take, or he could&#xD;
not be so harsh now." "Nonsense," he replied: "it  would be too&#xD;
unnatural for him to cherish anger toward his $   gild. Go&#xD;
with me, and you will see he is not so hard-hearted as you think&#xD;
him. The idea of having you in a boarding-school for two or&#xD;
three years, when you love me, and I love you so dearly. It is&#xD;
absurd."  Still she shook her head. "If I go with voU. Juian. I&#xD;
go as a pennyless bride. I know my father. His word is 'un-&#xD;
changeable. We will wait awhile. Perhaps he will change when&#xD;
he sees how true we are to our love. I will Zo to Madane's and&#xD;
learn all I can, so as to be presentable to your city friends. You&#xD;
will love me a great deal better then, Julian, when you see what&#xD;
a polished lady I shall be." "No, that is impossible.' he replied ;&#xD;
"you are all I could wish for now.&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
" who loves, raves-'tis youth's frenzy-but the cure&#xD;
Is bitterer still; as charm by charmunwinds&#xD;
Which robed our idols, and we see too sure&#xD;
Nor worth nor beauty dwells from out the mind's&#xD;
Ideal shape of such."-Byron.&#xD;
&#xD;
Much more lover-like nonsense was spoken, and they parted.&#xD;
In a few weeks she was at Madame Knowall's. She was too truly&#xD;
sensible to disregard her own interests ; but applied herself assid-&#xD;
uously to her studies, and no student made more rapid advance-&#xD;
ment than she. For one year she heard from Julian frequently.&#xD;
Then a longer silence became frequent, until another six months.&#xD;
had passed, when she heard that he wedded a wealthy widow&#xD;
whom he met at Saratoga. Her father wrote her a true letter of&#xD;
sympathy, not one word of rejoicing that he was false. Its deli-&#xD;
cacy touched her as nothing else could have done, and she replied&#xD;
expressing her gratitude that he had been so observant of char-&#xD;
acter as to prevent her marrying one with no depth of affection.&#xD;
She heard through a friend of h rs near her own home that Julian&#xD;
was recklessly dissipated and ha, wasted his own fortune, so'that&#xD;
he married for some one to take care of him.&#xD;
The months glided ,by and her school-days were near their&#xD;
close. She looked forward with sincere regret to her emancipa-&#xD;
tion. She could not forget her lover. It was not what he was,&#xD;
but what he had been to her, she regretted. She looked upon him&#xD;
as a hero;. and the thought that probably her refusal to wed him&#xD;
caused him to act as he had done, made her sad at'times. It is a&#xD;
very difficult matter for a woman to look with indifference upon.&#xD;
the man she had once thought to walk through life with. Her&#xD;
love invests him with a sacredness, a heroism which does not&#xD;
belong to other men, and it tales years to forget, or to cease to&#xD;
regret.&#xD;
While Lula knew him unworthy, she could not forget or cease&#xD;
to care for him. When her school-days were ended, and her&#xD;
father saw, with regret, the tears fill her eyes as she neared the&#xD;
spot where she had parted from her lover, so fondly, three years&#xD;
ago, he determined to take her to Europe. She was passionately&#xD;
fond of music and was no mean performer on piano and organ,&#xD;
so he told her he would take her to Germany, where she could&#xD;
have the assistance of the best teachers, hoping thereby to win&#xD;
her to forgetfulness and to interest in society.&#xD;
&#xD;
Five years have passed, and our heroine, weary of travel, turns&#xD;
her face homeward once more. Surely she is one of fortune's&#xD;
favorites. Wealth and title, which are so eagerly coveted by&#xD;
many republican (!) Americans, were laid at her feet, and politely&#xD;
yet firmly rejected. Therewas one hope yet in her heart which&#xD;
she could not, drive out-; unworthy as she knew it to be of her&#xD;
proud reason, yet it would not die, and until it was truly dead&#xD;
she felt that she would be doing an act of injustice to give her&#xD;
hand to another. No other man had power to stir her soul as&#xD;
Julian Montgomery had done. Though she felt it to be sinful to&#xD;
love him while he was the husband of another, she could not forget&#xD;
him.&#xD;
When she reached home, her father's house was thrown open&#xD;
for the reception of visitors. Many of the friends of her child-&#xD;
hood called, and were received with the charming simplicity of&#xD;
years ago. During her absence a seminary for young ladies had&#xD;
been started in a village within a mile of her home. The principal&#xD;
was a gentleman of rare attainments; modest, yet stately, one&#xD;
who, without vanity, knows that he is inferior to none.&#xD;
"A combination, and a form indeed,&#xD;
Where every god did seem to set his seal,&#xD;
To give the world assurance of a man."&#xD;
Mr. Harper was not long in forming the acquaintance of Mr.&#xD;
Goodwin. He was very much pleased with him and invited him to&#xD;
:,      his house.&#xD;
Mr. Goodwin had never seen Lula, and was surprised to find&#xD;
her at the head of the household, and presiding with so much&#xD;
grace. She was delighted with the knowledge of men and books&#xD;

&#xD;
he so modestly displayed. There was nothing light or frivolous&#xD;
about him, and when he praised her performance on the piano&#xD;
and her singing, she knew that he meant just what he said.&#xD;
With all his wisdom there was a deference to her opinions as if&#xD;
he thought her a woman worthy of attention in matters of science.&#xD;
Some men with more sound than sense think because an'opinion&#xD;
is uttered by a woman it is worthless; and they utter nothing but&#xD;
empty nothings in her presence as though she could not compre-&#xD;
hend anything sensible. Ihave seen men turn off with a con-&#xD;
temptuous sneer when a new book by a female was spoken of,&#xD;
and say in such an emphatic way, "I never read anything written&#xD;
by a woman:" I always think it a great pity that such men&#xD;
should have been subjected to the humiliation of having a woman&#xD;
for their mother. It is impossible to make a hero of such a man,&#xD;
therefore I say Mr. Goodwin was superior to such a weakness.&#xD;
He was really strong, inasmuch as he honored the weaker vessel.&#xD;
He did not look upon woman as a domestic animal merely, but as&#xD;
a reasoning being, and man's helpmeet in the true sense of the&#xD;
word.-;&#xD;
The months glided by, and Mr. Goodwin had become a regular&#xD;
visitor at the farm-house, and was greeted with undisguised&#xD;
pleasure by Lula and her father. He had heard all about her dis-&#xD;
appointment, fo; what village of a hundred inhabitants does not&#xD;
know every other person's business better than their own? He&#xD;
remembered it all, while seeming not to hear. He did not credit&#xD;
the story, until he had known her several months, and found that&#xD;
she had rejected several of the most eligible offers she could have&#xD;
had. Whenever a gentleman became pointed in his attentions&#xD;
she seemed to shun him, and was sad for some time. One. year&#xD;
after her return home she heard that Julian Montgomery's wife&#xD;
was dead. They had never lived happily together. Now she&#xD;
had died and left him the whole of her wealth. Would she ever&#xD;
see him again, and was he much changed? were questions which&#xD;
would arise when she tried hardest to keep them down.&#xD;
Mr. Goodwin noted the change, and sighed to think her so&#xD;
weak as to cling toisuch a hope all those years.. He had learned to&#xD;
love the only woman he had ever seen who came up to his,&#xD;
standard of female excellence. Even this seeming weakness he&#xD;
&#xD;
ALL FOR THE BEST.&#xD;
&#xD;
thought rather a virtue, as it betokened a depth and wealth of&#xD;
affection not often met with. So he worshipped her in silence,&#xD;
while she looked up to him as to one too wise to think of loving&#xD;
a woman. She honored and reverenced him as she did her father,&#xD;
though he was not ten years older than herself.&#xD;
It was a bright Saturday in June just seven years since she&#xD;
had parted with Juhian, and she had been busy all the morning,&#xD;
with Mr. Goodwin's assistance, in trimming some vines. When&#xD;
she had gotten through with it all, she threw herself upon the&#xD;
grass under the spreading oak, and exclaimed, " That was indeed&#xD;
a tiresome undertaking. I don't think I could ever have suc-&#xD;
ceeded without your assistance. Indeed, Mr. Goodwin, I shall&#xD;
miss you sadly during your vacation. Why must you go away&#xD;
off to the mountains? Why not stay here with us ?" She looked&#xD;
up at him as she spoke, and was surprised to see the change that&#xD;
had come over his immobile features. A hot flush suffused his&#xD;
face, and a passionate longing shone in his dark grey eyes as they&#xD;
met hers. Then he dropped on his knees before her and said,&#xD;
"If I might stay with you always, dear Miss Lula, or take you&#xD;
with me! 0, if I only dared to tell you how very, very lonely&#xD;
every place will be without you. May I say I love you-love you&#xD;
with all my manhood's devotion? I know I am presumptuous&#xD;
in telling you this when so many wealthy apd noble suitors have&#xD;
been rejected. But, 0, do not weep ! Have I wounded you,dear&#xD;
friend ? :Pardon me, I should  have been more guarded."&#xD;
She was weeping bitterly. Soon she raised her weeping eyes to&#xD;
his face and replied, "I did not think of the possibility of yors&#xD;
caring for me. I do not call it presumption. Indeed I am honored&#xD;
in being the object of such affection as yours. I honor you more&#xD;
than I have ever done any man I have met with ; and I feel that&#xD;
I would like to place my hand in yours and say, take me, lead me&#xD;
where you will, I shall go ! I could trust myself with you, with&#xD;
more perfect confidence than with any person I ever saw, but&#xD;
there is a dream of the past, of my early girlhood, which haunts&#xD;
me still. It is very foolish, I know, but I feel that I would be&#xD;
doing you an injustice were I to go to you with only half a&#xD;
heart."&#xD;
He looked at her with pity and tenderness, as he took her hand&#xD;

and said, "I have heard the story of your early love, and thought&#xD;
that one who could be so faithful to an unworthy love, would be&#xD;
a treasure indeed to one whose every aim in life would be to make&#xD;
her happy. Half of your heart is worth more than the whole of&#xD;
sonie women's. I have known you for two years, and have&#xD;
watched you narrowly. In all that time I have seen no unworthy&#xD;
action, have heard no unworthy thought uttered by you. I was&#xD;
deceived in my youth, by one as fair as an angel of light. I have.&#xD;
never thought I could love another. I was poor, and she left me&#xD;
for a wealthy suitor. I have never thought I could love another,&#xD;
until I saw you, and noticed you for months. I find my love for&#xD;
my deceiver was a boyish fancy, but this is love of my manhood.&#xD;
I am not rich now, but am independent. I believe you are sincere&#xD;
in what you tell me, and I am willing to take your respect and&#xD;
esteem, feeling sure that my great love will lead you to love me&#xD;
in return. But I will-not press you for an answer. Only tell me&#xD;
that you. will try to think favorably of my suit, and I can wait."&#xD;
"I will try," she replied, " but do not cease to be my friend under&#xD;
any circumstances." They walked into the house together, and&#xD;
talked together as usual. This was a revelation soAnew to her,&#xD;
she had become accustomed to the thought of being more to Mr."&#xD;
Goodwin than a mere friend. She found herself drawing a com-&#xD;
parison between Richard Goodwin and Julian Montgomery, and&#xD;
it ended in the favor of the former. But Julian may have grown&#xD;
more manly, and if she should see him would not the old love arise,&#xD;
and make her miserable ? She had long .ago decided that she could&#xD;
never wed him,.should he return. She was afraid to trust him;&#xD;
yet she might not be able to cast him off without a severe pang.&#xD;
Another week passed and Mr. Goodwin's school duties were&#xD;
ended for the summer. In two days he expected to leave for a&#xD;
visit to his relatives in a distant,11tate, and a short stay among the&#xD;
mountains. He was coming on the morrow to bid his friends at&#xD;
the farm-house farewell.&#xD;
Lula was invited to spend the evening with a young friend in&#xD;
the neighborhood and went, expecting to meet no one but the&#xD;
family. What was her surprise when told that a gentleman was&#xD;
stopping with them for a few days and was anxious to meet her.&#xD;
When she entered the parlor, a tall, portly gentleman arose and&#xD;

came to her, and she was surprised when he presented his hand.&#xD;
She drew back and looked to her friend to introduce her, when&#xD;
he said, ".Lula, can you have so entirely forgotten me?" The&#xD;
voice was not forgotten, and she looked up into his face to see&#xD;
the eyes, or something resembling the eyes, of Julian Montgomery&#xD;
looking down upon her. She said, "You are very much changed,&#xD;
but I believe I recognise Mr. Montgomery." She did not take the&#xD;
hand he proffered. One look into his bloated face and red eyes&#xD;
showed too conclusively that he was not the idol of her worship&#xD;
that had fallen, and she now saw, was crushed utterly, hopelessly&#xD;
shattered. As she sat and listened to his conversation, and noted&#xD;
the ravages of dissipation so visible in his whole personnel, the&#xD;
time passed very slowly, and she was rejoiced when the hour&#xD;
came for her return home. The house was within a half mile of&#xD;
her father's, and she preferred to walk it, and had sent the servant&#xD;
who had accompanied her home before she entered the house, as&#xD;
the young ladies of the house proposed to walk with her. She re-&#xD;
gretted this very much when she found that Julian was prepared&#xD;
to walk with her. She did not doubt that this was a plan to give&#xD;
him an opportunity to speak with her alone. After they had&#xD;
walked a little way the ladies fell back and left those two in front.&#xD;
He commenced and told her of his terrible disappointment&#xD;
when she gave him up for her father's whim. He did not believe&#xD;
she would marry him, and his friends were anxious for him to&#xD;
marry the lady he had called his wife. That he regretted the step&#xD;
as soon as it was taken, and had never ceased to love her. He was&#xD;
free now, and had come to offer her his hand and fortune. His&#xD;
future life should be devoted to her. He felt highly flattered to&#xD;
think she had remained single on his account. "Please do not&#xD;
go any farther, Mr. Montgomery. If I have permitted a foolish&#xD;
fancy to prevent me from accepting a much more worthy love,&#xD;
that fancy is at an end. The dream has been dispelled. Pray do&#xD;
not lay that flattering unction to your soul. You are not the man&#xD;
my childish fancy painted. I needed but this short interview to&#xD;
prove to me how very blind I was, and how keen was my honored&#xD;
father's perception of character. His 'whim' has been a bless-&#xD;
ing to his grateful child. I am sorry you should have troubled&#xD;
yourself to come so far to undeceive me ; but am sorry on your&#xD;

So good night, Mr. Montgomery."  She walked on and left him&#xD;
standing alone. When she reached the house, she went to her&#xD;
father's room and told him all, and thanked him for saving her&#xD;
from such a man. Then she -told him of Mr. Goodwiin's love, and&#xD;
he was pleased and told her she was honored in the possessor. of&#xD;
such a treasure. " I'know ,and feel it now, father."&#xD;
The next day, when Mr. Goodwin asked Lula to.think of him&#xD;
while absent as her truest friend, she replied, 4 I will, and as more&#xD;
than that, if you wish it still." He looked down into her truthful&#xD;
blue eyes, then caught her to his heart, as he whispered, " Am I&#xD;
all to you, Lula, as you are to me? Have you seen him, and is&#xD;
the dream broken ?" "I have seen him, Richard, and the only&#xD;
wonder is that I ever fancied him. As with you, that was a&#xD;
childish fancy : here lean rest with trust for all time."&#xD;
When the autumn winds were turning the forests brown there&#xD;
was a wedding, where the happy couple-the admired of all, and&#xD;
the envied of many, were. Richard Goodwin an Lula Harper,&#xD;

"No, sir, I will not he a party to any such outrage, for outrage&#xD;
I must consider it. What other name can be given to such a&#xD;
transaction ? Here I must marry a certain young lady whom I&#xD;
have never seen, or lose my inheritance. I may not like her, and&#xD;
she may not like me. I ar sure I would not wed her to save my&#xD;
father's estate, neither would I be willing to accept her were&#xD;
she willing to wed me for the sake of that estate. Give it to her&#xD;
if she wishes it. Thank God I live in a free country, where, with&#xD;

Ed ward Earle had been at a German university for four years,&#xD;
since which time he had been travelling for pleasure as well as for&#xD;
instruction. Medicine was his chosen profession, and he gave his&#xD;
attention to it at alUl times. The summons home to take charge&#xD;
of his father's estate, had found him amid the wild and picturesque&#xD;
scenery of the Alps. Grifkor a father dearly loved left him no&#xD;
desire to remain longer with his .companions in travel, and he&#xD;
hastened home, to find, upon reaching the city near his home,&#xD;
that a will was made leaving him the whole of his immense&#xD;
wealth upon condition that he was to wed Alice Wolverton, as e&#xD;
promise had been made her father, when she and Edward were&#xD;
children, that they should be united when she was twenty-one&#xD;
and he twenty-five. Her father had died about the time Edward&#xD;
went to Europe, and Mr. Earle- had taken her to his house and.&#xD;
employed teachers, so that she mightabe with him all the time.&#xD;
Mr. Earle had been a widower since Edward's birth, with no&#xD;
female relative to take the place of mother to the little boy. A&#xD;
competent housekeeper superintended his household affairs, and&#xD;
the little Edward learned to love her dearly. When informed that&#xD;
his father had taken the daughter of an old friend, he was pleased&#xD;
at the prospect of his father's loneliness being relieved by a sweet&#xD;

his home when he returned,. His mortiflcation' and grief were&#xD;
great, upon reaching the otTice of his father's executor, to find the&#xD;
true state of affairs.&#xD;
Mr. Wiseman tried to reconcile him to the provision of the&#xD;
will, by dwelling upon the beauty, grace and acconiplislments of&#xD;
the young lady, until finding it avaied nothing, he said: " Well,&#xD;
it is just as well so. I suppose for the young lady has proven her&#xD;
aversion to the proposed u nioh, in terms as strong and decided as&#xD;
yon have done and in taking her self of to parts unknown. She&#xD;

I triedto nd where she was going to, but could get nothing out&#xD;

inc and I think I can sleep." She took his hanl and said, as&#xD;
gently as a mother would speak to her suffering child: "I will&#xD;
not leave you; sleep now and you will be better when you wakee"&#xD;
Ie did sleep, as peacefully as a child, and awoke refreshed and&#xD;
strengthened.&#xD;
Tihe days passed rapidly to our suffering hero until he was&#xD;
strong enough'to sit iup. His nurse found time to stop beide his&#xD;
easy-chair and speak a few words of encouragement as she flitted&#xD;
about, waiting on the sick and wounded.&#xD;
He did not think in those days; he knew that e'ery place was&#xD;
dark without the light of'her presence, and he lived only when&#xD;
he met those sympathetic eyes smiling uprn him, or moist with&#xD;
the dew of pity when he was suffering.&#xD;
As the weeks lengthened into months, and he knew that he&#xD;
must leave Memphis, the thought of parting with his n'rse grew&#xD;
painful, and he knew that he loved her onIV as he must love the&#xD;
woman he asked to be his wife. At length he detained her, as&#xD;
she passed him on one of her daily rounds, and retaining the hand&#xD;
she had extended in her good-morning. saidL "Mss Cark, do&#xD;
know I ain to leave here to-morrowI? I have sayed here too l:zng&#xD;
already. I have a comfortable horne and good semmns, who&#xD;

"Must you go? I am so sorry" was a:: she said, b4it he: voice&#xD;

THAT. OLD, OLD STORY.&#xD;
&#xD;
are to me. I have never known what love was until I met you. I&#xD;
know nothing of you save that you are an angel, and I want you&#xD;
to nurse me back to health and happiness, as only a beloved wife&#xD;
can nurse her husband. Will you leave this place and go with&#xD;
me as my bride, my own sweet Alice?"&#xD;
She turned her head to look into the face upturned towards&#xD;
her, and a flush stole over her fair face as she met those magnifi-&#xD;
cent black eyes, so full of pleading tenderness. She did not speak;&#xD;
but he must have fancied he saw his reply in her eyes, for his arm&#xD;
stole around her, and the sweet face was drawn down to meet the&#xD;
warm kisses which showered upon her cheeks and lips, as he mur-&#xD;
mured, "My sweet Alice."&#xD;
It was decided that he was to remain at the hotel a week until&#xD;
she could find some one to take her place in the hospital as nurse,'&#xD;
then she would wed him and go with him to his homle in Mary-&#xD;
land. She said, before leaving him, "Dr. Early, I have something&#xD;
to tell you before we go farther in our preparations. My name is.&#xD;
not Miss Clark ; it is Alice Clark Wolverton. I took my mother's&#xD;
maiden name, which is also my middle name, for a reason which&#xD;
I think I ought to tell you."  She did not notice the quick start&#xD;
he gave as she told her name, nor did she observe the peculiar&#xD;
twinkle of his eyes, but proceeded to tell him, all the story of her&#xD;
life. When she left Elmwood she had gone South, and found&#xD;
employment as governess in a country family. Her home was a&#xD;
pleasant one until the war broke out, and her employers were not&#xD;
able to engage her for another term. She had tried to get another&#xD;
situation and failed. She had gone to Memphis and obtained em-&#xD;
ployment as assistant music-teacher in a school, which place she&#xD;
kept until the battle in which he was wounded. Nurses were&#xD;
sorely needed, and she had offered her services, little dreaming&#xD;
she should meet her fate the very day of entering the hospital.&#xD;
He looked up and said: "Alice, did it ever occur to you that&#xD;
my name was not Early?" " 0, no, indeed it never did. Is not&#xD;
that your name?" she asked with surprise. He smiled, and held&#xD;
her close to him, as -he said: "You shall not escape Ime now,&#xD;
much as I once wished it. Your revelation of your name and&#xD;
history is a surpi-ise to me, but a very pleasant one; for know, my&#xD;
darling, though you did not tell me the name of your foster-father,&#xD;

I know it was Earle ; and don't run away, he was my natural&#xD;
father, and I am Edward Earle, not Early."&#xD;
She buried her face in her hands and burst into tears. He was&#xD;
really distressed at her agitation, and said: "Is my name so very&#xD;
hateful to you, sweet Alice? It is not my fault that you were de-&#xD;
ceived. My soldier friends all called me Early, though I always&#xD;
told my true name. I did not. think the slight difference worth&#xD;
the trouble of an explanation until to-day. Don't weep, Alice,&#xD;
you distress me. Do you hate me, when I love you so?" "Hate&#xD;
you'? 0, no," she replied, " I love you very dearly, and I think I&#xD;
can't help myself if I do marry yod, though I vowed never to like&#xD;
you, or touch one cent of your father's property, just because he&#xD;
wished to force us to love each other. I loved your father, Ed-&#xD;
ward, and perhaps it is all right, and we' were made for each&#xD;
other."&#xD;
"I know it is all right, Alice. We were terribly rebellious&#xD;
against our fate, but love each other too dearly now to find fault&#xD;
with Providence."'&#xD;
A week later the household of Elmwood were surprised to find&#xD;
their beloved Miss Alice really their mistress, and a very happy&#xD;
one, as happy as her lord. Though he walked on crutches for a&#xD;
long while, he never regretted his hospital experience, and laugh-&#xD;
ingly told his friends he was a married man' because'he couldn't&#xD;
help himself.&#xD;

ANNIE ARMISTEAD.&#xD;
There was a sound of revelry by night,&#xD;
*  *  *      And bright&#xD;
The lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men.&#xD;
A thousand hearts beat happily, and when&#xD;
Music arose with Its voluptuous swell,&#xD;
Soft eyes looked love to eyes whicA spare again,&#xD;
And all went merry as a marriage bell.",-Byron.&#xD;
'Twas during the month of February, 1864, the troop of&#xD;
cavalry from --  county, Virginia, was at home resting and re-&#xD;
cruiting. The citizens gave them a dinner at the county seat, and&#xD;
at night of the same day the troop gave a ball.&#xD;
All of the friends of the soldiers were present, and a crowd&#xD;
there was truly. Among the number present, who. seemed to&#xD;
enter with peculiar zest into the amusements of the occasion, I&#xD;
noticed Annie Armistead. Her beautiful black eyes sparkled with&#xD;
mirth, her laugh rang out in ripples of joy, and her step seemed&#xD;
peculiarly light and graceful as she moved through the dance.&#xD;
She was quite a belle, and did not want for attention, and danced&#xD;
all night with unabated zeal. She stood before me once during a&#xD;
paus  inthe dance. As I arranged some portion of her dress&#xD;
which was a little disordered, she stooped and kissed me, as she&#xD;
sai "I feel so happy to-night.. I do not know why it is, but I&#xD;
,haven't a care in the world."  I replied, "I am glad to see you&#xD;
so happy, Annie. I can't understand though, how you can be so&#xD;
free from care, with two brothers, and one still dearer than they, in&#xD;
the army, exposed to danger all the w 'le." She smiled as she said,.&#xD;
" They are safe ; I feel just as sure th t n harm will befall them&#xD;
as I do that I am here to-night. That is w at makes me so light-&#xD;
hearted. I know they will not be h rt,' and she moved off as&#xD;
lightly and as gaily as a bird on the  g.&#xD;
There were others present who seemed to enjoy the occasion,&#xD;

&#xD;
There were fair ladies and handsome, noble-looking me , men&#xD;
who wore the Confederate grey with proud dignity ; yet ny eyes&#xD;
followed that one girlish form, and a sigh of sadness would force&#xD;
itself up from some unknown source as I witnessed her unusual&#xD;
glow of happiness. I knew that she was a very affectionate&#xD;
sister, and had grieved deeply for the brothers absent in the army.&#xD;
I knew, too, that her whole heart was given to one worthy of her&#xD;
guileless love, and that.he was an officer in 'that portion of Gen.&#xD;
Lee's army which was always in danger ; for this reason her&#xD;
present -exuberance of spirit was inexplicable to me, and I&#xD;
watched her with anxious fear.&#xD;
The months .passed by and still Annie Armistead was as gay&#xD;
as a bird in the bright, beautiful spring days. Preparations were&#xD;
going forward for a quiet bridal. Annie was an orphan, but she&#xD;
had kind relatives who did all in their power to render her happy.&#xD;
She wasnot naturally so gay, and her friends wondered at her&#xD;
exuberance of spirits. Still they knew she loved devotedly, and&#xD;
there was never a fonder sister. Strangers looked on and won-&#xD;
dered if she loved Lieut. Harper; if so, why did she show such&#xD;
reckless disregard to the fact that he was exposed to more immi-&#xD;
nent peril than at any time during the three years of war.&#xD;

The spring of 1864 was ushered in by the booming-of cannon,&#xD;
and fearful reports of killed and wounded along the lines. The&#xD;
story of that terrible succession of battles, of which that of the&#xD;
Wilderness seemed the culmination of fierce valor and horrible&#xD;
massacre, has been told in history, song and story. It is not my&#xD;
purpose to go into any details of war records or party spirit ; I&#xD;

&#xD;
ANNIE ARIISTEAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
The first week in May was the time appointed for Annie Ar-&#xD;
nistead's bridal. Lieut. Harper was to get a furlough for two&#xD;
weeks and take his bride with him to Winchester, to visit some&#xD;
rativ. How true it is that "man proposes but God disposes."&#xD;
Thenight before the bridal eve a letter was received stating&#xD;
that as action had commenced along the 'lines, and the, spring&#xD;
campaign promised to be a bloody one, no furloughs could bo&#xD;
granted just then, consequently the marriage must, necessarily,&#xD;
be postponed. There was a startled, frightened look in her eyes&#xD;
for afew moments, then Annie. said, "It is only a precautionary&#xD;
mear   of Gen. Lee. There is no real danger. Lieut. Harper&#xD;
will come sooner than you all expect him." Still she was restless&#xD;
and uneasy.&#xD;
A uneek passed, ind then came the news of the battle of the&#xD;
Wilderness. First there were rumors of the killed and wounded.&#xD;
Then'came a letter to Annie directed in a strange hand. She .&#xD;
turned deadly pale as she caught it, and turned to a friend and&#xD;
gasped, "Read it." It was written by a friend of her lover, one&#xD;
whse name had been frequently mentioned'to her; and the in-&#xD;
tlsencewas a crushing blow to her confident heart. Lieut.&#xD;
Harper had fought bravely through the series of battles. On the&#xD;
afternoon of the 11th he had been nearly surrounded by the&#xD;
enemy, and had cut his way out, when he caught sight of her&#xD;
brother, George Armistead, badly wounded and in' danger of&#xD;
being trampled to death. He leaped from his horse to raise the&#xD;
wounded boy and try to get him to a safer position, when. he was&#xD;
observed by the enemy and fired at y two of their sharpshooters.&#xD;
Their aim was too unerring, and oth he and the poor boy he&#xD;
was trying to aid fell dead side by side. The letter was full of&#xD;
s ypathy for the living and of loving regret for the dead; but it&#xD;
f  upon unheeding ears. When Annie found that her lover and&#xD;
brother were dead, a wild shriek rang out upon the air, and she&#xD;
fell into a swoon from which, after hours of exertion on the part&#xD;
of her friends' and a physician who had been summoned, she was&#xD;
aroused, but not to consciousness. For three weeks she raved in&#xD;
wild delirium; then she sank into a state of apathy which was&#xD;
as distressing to her friends as her delirium had been. Her long&#xD;
and glossy tresses had been cut close to her head ; and when,&#xD;
&#xD;
ANNIE ARISTEAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
163&#xD;
&#xD;
months afterward, I met her, she was scarcely recognisable. Her&#xD;
bright color had fled and given place to a ghastly pallor. Her&#xD;
ey   hi had so sparkled with joy, had a wistful, far-off look&#xD;
which was pitiful to behold, and there was a painful languor in&#xD;
her movement as she walked about, as if she were forced to move.&#xD;
Twelve months passed away ; the (var had ended and the sol-&#xD;
diers returned to their poverty-stricken homes. Many thousands&#xD;
of our bravest and dearest were left in soldiers' graves upon&#xD;
strange soil. Lieut. Harper had been interred in Holywood Cem-&#xD;
etery, in Richmond. His friend, Capt. Burton, wrote to Annie&#xD;
that his remains had been taken to Holywood, and a slab bearing&#xD;
his name, etc., had been placed a his head. She wrote a few  nes&#xD;
of thanks, and set about trying to visit his grave. She went&#xD;
with a friend to Richmond, and went to Holywood. They&#xD;
walked about among the new-made graves of the soldiers until&#xD;
she was worn down with fatigue, but could not find the name she&#xD;
sought. There were so many soldiers buried there, and the stones&#xD;
were so covered over with flowers, it was difficult for a stranger&#xD;
to find any one he wanted. Annie was turning away with her&#xD;
flowers just as the sun was sinking behind the western hills. Her&#xD;
heart was very sad, 'and the tears gathered in her eyes, as she&#xD;
stopped and cried, "0, can no one tell me where he lies ? "&#xD;
There was a stranger leaning on a head-stone near by, who&#xD;
stepped forward and lifted his hat as he asked:&#xD;
"Can I be of any service to you, Madam ? I am well ac-&#xD;
quainted here. Tell me whom you seek."&#xD;
She raised her sad eyes to his. face and said: " Please tell me&#xD;
where Lieut. Harper lies." He started violently, for he knew&#xD;
this sad- but beautiful creature must be Annie Armistead. He&#xD;
had heard so much of her from his friend that he felt sure he&#xD;
would know her at sight, and though so changed, yet he felt she&#xD;
was more interesting in her sorrow, more lovely, if possible, than&#xD;
in her happiness.&#xD;
He stepped back to the grave .he had been leaning on and&#xD;
said, This ishis resting place -- the grave of the dearest friend I&#xD;
had. Poor Herbert !"&#xD;
Annie held out her hand to him and asked in that child-like&#xD;
simplicity which so characterised her since his death, "Did you&#xD;

him. Herbert, Herbert, Oh! Herbert," she cried as she sank&#xD;
upon the grave.&#xD;
The sun had sunk beneath the horizon and the stars were,&#xD;
Coming out, still she lay there moaning. Her friend tried to&#xD;
ise her, but she refused to move. Marion Burton, for it was he,&#xD;
the friend of her lover, raised her from the ground and said,&#xD;
" Come, Miss Armistead, you must return to your home now. tI&#xD;
am, Marion Burton, Herbert's friend. I will call for you to-&#xD;
morrow and bring you here, when you can stay longer, and we&#xD;
will plant 'a rose to bloom o'er his bed.' Tell me where you are&#xD;
stopping, so that I may call." She could notespeak, but her&#xD;
friend gave his name and the .name of his hotel. She followed&#xD;
without resistance, and was placed in a carriage and borne of&#xD;
"he remained in Richmond several days, spending a large portion&#xD;
of each day at the grave of her soldier lover. Marion&#xD;
was with her every day. He felt strangely. drawn to this pale,&#xD;
sad girl, so young to have her hopes so rudely blighted. The fact&#xD;
that he was the friend of the one she loved made her yield to his&#xD;
guidance and feel. that a tie of sympathy existed between them.&#xD;
She would talk to. him more freely than to any other person.&#xD;
He tried to convince her that it was sinful to resign herself so&#xD;
wholly to this great sorrow ; that, for the sake of her friends it&#xD;
was her duty to try to overcome it, and to take a greater interest&#xD;
in life.&#xD;

I need not linger over the events which followed the visit to&#xD;
Richmond, nor tell of the letters, full of friendly sympathy and&#xD;

. It is a wise provision of nature that our extreme anguish will&#xD;
wear out, and though the dead cannot be forgotten, new friend-&#xD;
ships, even new loves, will spring up to fill the void in our hearts&#xD;
and lives.'&#xD;
When, twelve months after their meeting, Captain Burton&#xD;
asked Annie to give herself to him, and permit him to shield her&#xD;
from the rude blasts of adversity to which the war had reduced&#xD;
her, he had come to the question so gradually, and so won upon&#xD;
her confidence and affection by his sympathy and love for her&#xD;
dead, she did not hesitate to yield her consent to his proposal.&#xD;
She had not forgotten, nor could she ever forget, her dead love;&#xD;
and she told him so ; but if lie was willing to take her as she was,&#xD;
she would be a true and loving wife.&#xD;
Two months later he came ; and when he returned to his home&#xD;
in Winchester, Annie went with him, a quiet, but not unhappy&#xD;
bride. His friends knew her history, and had pitied and loved her&#xD;
before they saw her; now, she was welcomed by warm hearts, and&#xD;
her husband's relatives and those ,of Lieut. Harper, who resided&#xD;
in the same town, vied witheach other in trying to make her con-&#xD;
tented and happy. Though she never was as gay as she had been,&#xD;
yet her cheeks regained their bloom and her eyes their former&#xD;
lustre, for she had everything to render her happy.&#xD;
I wish I could leave her'here, happy in the love of her noble&#xD;
husband and so many kind, friends, but truth compels me to go&#xD;
on.&#xD;
One year after her bridal as baby-boy was given to her keep-&#xD;
ing. As the happy father took him in his arms for the first time,&#xD;
he kissed the pale young mother; and asked : " Shall we call him&#xD;
Herbert, darling?" -"0, no," she replied; "let him be named&#xD;
Marion. Call him by his father's name."&#xD;
She was cheerful, and all who saw her thought she was re-&#xD;
markably well. At the expiration of two weeks she became rest-&#xD;
less and feverish ; and in a -few hours was raving in delirium.&#xD;
Her' husband was almost frantic witlh grief. The best medical&#xD;
skill (he place afforded was called into requisition, but to no pur-&#xD;
pose. ,Twenty-four .hours of intense agony and- wildest frenzy,&#xD;
and the young mother sank into a stupor, from which her.physi-&#xD;
cians said she would never arouse.&#xD;

Just as the sun arose above the hills she opened her eyes and&#xD;
smiled upon her husband, then closed them  again for a few&#xD;
minutes. He caught her hand, and called her by the fond names&#xD;
she loved so well;- but no response cam. Slowly she opened&#xD;
her eyes once more, and with a bright smile she raised her hands&#xD;
and cried, " Herbert, dear Herbert, I' come." Friends gathered&#xD;
around, but she saw no one, heard no one. Her pure spirit htad&#xD;
fled, and was wandering with the one she loved so fondly. The&#xD;
bright, triumphant expression lingered until the body was low-&#xD;
ered to its last resting-place.&#xD;
She was followed to the grave by a large and sympathetic&#xD;
crowd of friends, and the deeply bereaved husband and helpless&#xD;
little babe were not forgotten. She was laid beside Lieut. Harper,&#xD;
in Holywood, and a beautiful monument marks the spot. The&#xD;
graves are decorated with fresh flowers every day, and the spot&#xD;
where lie the youthful martyrs of the war is considered sacred&#xD;
ground.&#xD;

LOVE AND -HATE.&#xD;
"Romeo! Rnomeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo ?"---shakspeare.&#xD;
There was a sound, of revelry by night," which was not&#xD;
disturbed by the clang and clamor of arms. The occasion was a&#xD;
wedding party at the house of one of the wealthy farmers of the&#xD;
Shenandoah Valley, to which were invited the youth and beauty&#xD;
of the neighborhood. Among the young persons. present was&#xD;
Charles Carrington, who had but recently returned from Europe&#xD;
where he had been to complete his studies. He had just com-&#xD;
pleted his twenty-fifth year, was- blessed by nature with a hand-&#xD;
some face and figure, and a very fine intellect, which had been&#xD;
improved and polished by seven years of study and travel in&#xD;
foreign lands. He had a peculiarly distingue appearance which&#xD;
rendered him perfectly irresistible to the ladies, who crowded&#xD;
around to renew the acquaintance of their childhood. He was&#xD;
the cynosure of all eyes. All, did I say? There was one excep-&#xD;
tion, at least. There were some persons present who were entire&#xD;
strangers to the distinguished traveller ; among that number were&#xD;
the bride, and a young lady who sat with her delicately chiseled&#xD;
features turned partly away from the group around him, and&#xD;
conversing with the bride as easily as though there were no&#xD;
"bright particular star " present. Near her were several gentle-&#xD;
men who saw no face but hers. Her attitude was the personifica-&#xD;
tion of grace, and her voice, so sweetly modulated, was music's&#xD;
very self. - The approach of other persons toward her group&#xD;
caused her to turn her head, and her eyes met the admiring glance&#xD;
of the handsomest pair she thought she - had ever seen. - The&#xD;
happy bridegroom had brought his friend for presentation to his&#xD;
bride, after which ceremony Mr. Gilmore turned and said: " Miss&#xD;
Erwin, permit me to present to you my friend, Mr.'Carrington.&#xD;

mated conversation. Though Miss Erwin'had never. travelled&#xD;
outside of her own native country, she read many books of&#xD;
travels, and really enjoyed comparing what she had read with the&#xD;
descriptions Mr. Carrington gave her. From travels the transi-&#xD;
tion to the literature of different nations was very natural, and&#xD;
he found her familiar with his favorite German authors.&#xD;
There were many friends who wished -to converse with him&#xD;
that evening, and he was frequently interrupted, but would turn&#xD;
again to his magnet, as truly as the needle to. the pole: The&#xD;
evening came to an end, as all pleasures must. Not so the ac-&#xD;
quaintance begun that evening. Minnie Erwin was a relative of&#xD;
the bride, and remained with her two weeks, during which time&#xD;
Charley Carrington came nearly every day to Mr. Gilmore's ;&#xD;
sometimes with a new book, or a new German song which he&#xD;
wished to sing with Miss Erwin, or to ask Miss Erwin to ride with&#xD;
him. The days seemed winged Mercuries, so swiftly did they fly.&#xD;
At length the time appointed for Minnie's return to her home,&#xD;
which was only ten miles distant, arrived, and. in company with&#xD;
her friends, the Gilmores, she returned to her father's house. Mr.&#xD;
Carrington had- promised to call in a few days. Mr. Erwin had&#xD;
been a widower for several years. His neighbors knew him as a&#xD;
morose, unsocial man, while his servants looked upon him as a&#xD;
stern but just master ; and his daughter, and only child, looked&#xD;
up to him as to. a superior being, who rarely smiled,.but was&#xD;
always kind and indulgent -to her. He had devoted a great por-&#xD;
tion of his time to her education ; he was not satisfied that his&#xD;
daughter should learn anything superficially. While he employed&#xD;
teachers, he was not satisfied to trust them alone. He had been&#xD;
a great traveller in his early manhood, and was master of several&#xD;
foreign- tongues, which he taught his daughter in person. He&#xD;
cared nothing for society, but permitted his daughter to visit, and&#xD;
to encourage the visits of a select few.. -&#xD;
Mr. Carrington did not delay his visit long. The next after-&#xD;
noon saw him entering the tastefully decorated grounds of Mr.&#xD;
Erwin, which gentleman he had never met. - River View, the&#xD;
home -of the Erwins, was situated upon a hill overlooking the&#xD;

most beautiful portion of that beautiful stream, the Shenandoah.&#xD;
Nature, ever profuse in her loveliness, had done very much&#xD;
for River View; while art, far from detract'  from her beauty,&#xD;
had done much to aid her in making the ho 4e f man sufficiently&#xD;
beautiful to be the abode of celestial beings. Surely, peace and&#xD;
happiness ought to dwell there; and Charley Carrington almost&#xD;
gave audible utterance to the thought then uppermost inhis mind :&#xD;
"How beautiful! But not too lovely for the angel that dwells&#xD;
here !"&#xD;
Mr. Erwin was not in the house when Mr. Carrington arrived,&#xD;
nor did he reach home until near nightfall. When he entered&#xD;
the parlor, he found a stranger standing beside his daughter,&#xD;
whose light fingers were producing sweetest music from the keys&#xD;
of her piano. The look of admiration was unmistakable, and&#xD;
the father stopped on the threshold to take a better'view-of this&#xD;
man who might steal his daughter's heart from him. Surely&#xD;
there was nothing to complain of in the aristocratic bearing, the&#xD;
true nobility which shone in every lineament of his handsome&#xD;
face, and the respectful adoration so plainly visible in his eyes. He&#xD;
was drawn toward him irresistibly, and the momentary verdict&#xD;
was a good one. Just then the music ceased, and he moved for-&#xD;
ward, while Mr. Gilmore, who had been curiously observing his&#xD;
movements, arose, and presented to him Mr. Carrington. As the&#xD;
name was called, Mr. Erwin presented his hand with old Virginia&#xD;
cordiality, but an indefinable something in the motion of his guest&#xD;
made him start back and exclaim, " Carrington ? What Carring-&#xD;
ton ?    My name is Charles Carrington, sir, son of Charles Car-&#xD;
rington, of this county," replied" the young man.&#xD;
A deathly pallor had overspread the old man's face as he spoke,&#xD;
and he staggered and gasped for breath. His daughter placed an&#xD;
easy-chair near him, and tried to seat him in it. He grasped the&#xD;
back of it, and glared at his visitor, as he hissed, "' Young man,&#xD;
did you come to beard the lion in his den? or did your father&#xD;
never tell you how I hate the very sound of his name?"&#xD;
Charley drew himself up and looked steadily into the old&#xD;
man's eyes as he replied, "If my father has aught against you,&#xD;
I have never heard him 'mention it. No, sir, my father never&#xD;
speaks harshly of any one. When I told him of meeting Miss&#xD;

Erwin at Mr. Gilmore's he merely replied,   I am glad you like&#xD;
her, my son.'"  " Ha ! ha!" laughed Mr. Erwin. " Yes, I dare&#xD;
say he is. Take yourself out of my house,'young man. You arc&#xD;
like him, and her too. Don't cross my path again. No, sir, no, a&#xD;
thousand times -no ! I would bury my child alive before she&#xD;
should wed A son of Charles and Mary Carrington. Take your&#xD;
hands off, young man. She has merely fainted. Go, and may. all&#xD;
the demons of perdition follow eyerything.dear to Charles Car-&#xD;
rington."&#xD;
Charles had stooped to raise Minnie from the floor where she&#xD;
had fallen, when-her father seized his arm and ordered him to go.&#xD;
He lifted her and pressed one kiss upon her pale cheek, then&#xD;
laid her upon the sofa, and with a face as pale as the one he had&#xD;
kissed for the first and perhaps the last time, turned without a&#xD;
word to any one, and left hope and happiness which but a few&#xD;
moments before had seemed more of heaven than of earth.&#xD;
We will leave him to mount his horse and gallop homeward in,&#xD;
the moonlight, which he is too miserable to see is gloriously full&#xD;
and silvery,'and follow Minnie Erwin.&#xD;
Minnie's swoon was so death-like, Mr. and Mrs. Gilmore tried&#xD;
in vain to restore her by means within their i'each. At length&#xD;
Mrs. Gilmore turned to Mr. Erwin, who, still sat the. picture of&#xD;
rage and blind fury, and said, " Uncle William, you have killed&#xD;
your child."  He started suddenly and' looked at her. She&#xD;
pointed to the sofa where Mr. Gilmore was still trying to bring back&#xD;
life into that lovely frame. In a moment the father gained the&#xD;
ascendancy over every other feeling, and he knelt beside her and&#xD;
chafed-her hands, as he murmured," Who said I killed you, dar-&#xD;
ling ? Minnie, love," look at me once more." Mr. Gilmore asked&#xD;
if he had nothing in the house which could be used with effect.&#xD;
A bottle of hartshorn was found, whose pungency restored res-&#xD;
piration, and they had the satisfaction of seeing her open her*&#xD;
eyes and look around.&#xD;
Where is Charley? I thought he was here,"-she asked&#xD;
faintly; then seeming to remember all, she threw her arms around&#xD;
her father's neck and cried, " o, father ! 0, my father ! "&#xD;
He laid her back on the sofa and said as gently as he could,&#xD;
'My child, 9 "re all I have on earth to love, but you must not&#xD;

come between me and my hate. It was engendered years before&#xD;
you were born. Time has failed to soften it. I have vowed&#xD;
never to - forgive that man for crossing my path. I cannot go&#xD;
into details now. It would. arouse the demon in me which you&#xD;
are too feeble to see in all its hideous deformity. Nay, do not in-&#xD;
terrupt me. I know what you would say. It is enough that he&#xD;
is the son of my mortal enemy; and dearly as I love you, wil-&#xD;
lingly as I would make any other sacrifice for. you, I would see&#xD;
you die rather than see you his wife. Forget him. Let his name&#xD;
never be called in my presence again. Should you see him or&#xD;
have any communication with him in any way, I shall disown&#xD;
you and never see your face again. I have long desired to take&#xD;
you to Europe. Our late war prevented my doing so. Now we&#xD;
will leave this place in a week. Any preparations you may need&#xD;
can be made in New York, where we will stop for a while."&#xD;
He turned and left the room. Mrs. Gilmore knelt beside her&#xD;
weeping cousin and put her arms around her, as she begged her.&#xD;
to be true to herself to resist such injustice. " We have enough&#xD;
dear Minnie, and you shall share our home until Charley takes&#xD;
you to his noble heart. If there were any reason for this strange&#xD;
anger of Uncle William's I would be the last to counsel you in&#xD;
this way; but Mr. Carrington has always borne a reputation&#xD;
above reproach. I am sure he would not knowingly injure any&#xD;
one; and Charley is a young man whom any one might be pleased&#xD;
to, call his son. Go with us home, Minnie, and your father will&#xD;
soon repent his harshness and come for you."&#xD;
"Nettie," Minnie replied, "you are so happy just now, you&#xD;
think I could be happy without my father's love. You counsel&#xD;
me to disobey a parent who has never failed in his kindness to his&#xD;
motherless girl, no matter what he may have been to others. No,&#xD;
no, my cousin; from my heart I thank you and Mr. Gilmore for&#xD;
your kindness, but must follow my father. Perhaps the day may&#xD;
come when I may meet Charley. If he remains-true to me we&#xD;
may yet be happy, though I see no light ahead just now. Tell&#xD;
him to forget me andseek one whose hand can go with her love.&#xD;
I cannot love another. The truth I plighted to him this after-&#xD;
noon in the honeysuckle bower cannot be recalled. I shall not&#xD;
marry, but I would not keep him bound. Tell him he is 'free.&#xD;

This is the last time I must speak of him.. Tell him God only&#xD;

I must not linger over details, or my story will be lengthened&#xD;
out too much. I will hasten on.&#xD;
Four years passed away, and it is 1September,.a1870 The Er-&#xD;
wins, father and daughter, had returned to River view after&#xD;
having njade the tour of Europe, visiting every place of note or&#xD;
probable interest. Mr. Erwin was tired of travel,tand feeling&#xD;
satisfied that the homage paid to his daughter's beauty and itel-&#xD;
lect by the nobility of foreign lands had obliterated all traces of&#xD;
Charley Carrington's image, he was content to settle down upon&#xD;
his farm without a desire to wander further. Many rare articles&#xD;
of beauty and utility were bought to decorate their home. The&#xD;
grounds had been left in the care of an experienced florist, and&#xD;
presented a handsome appearance upon their return.&#xD;
Friends called, and the affairs of the neighborhood were dis-&#xD;
cussed. Dr. Carrington was upon the tongues of all the young&#xD;
ladies. He had settled in a village near by, and was practising&#xD;
medicine with eminent success, endearing himself to all hearts by&#xD;
his gentleness and kindness to the poor. Many wondered why&#xD;
he did not marry. He certainly did not lack for opportuni-&#xD;
ties to select a wife, for he had but to make his choice pnd te&#xD;
bride would be ready. But, while he was polite to all, hehdnt&#xD;
no preference for any lady. Two weeks passed, and he had not&#xD;
seen Minnie since her return. He called ou Mrs. Gi  r,h but&#xD;
she could tell him nothing, as Minnie would not talk about her-&#xD;
self. .&#xD;
The mild beauty of that September will long be remembeed&#xD;
by many persons, whose Valley homes were so gloriously beautiful&#xD;
before that terrible and ever memorable flood of the 29th and 30th&#xD;
of September, 1870, burst in such wild and sudden fury upon them.&#xD;
River View was on a cliff very near the river, sufficiently elevated&#xD;
to be secure from any high water-far above any mark ever made.&#xD;
by water.&#xD;
Minnie Erwin sat in her chamber that evening, sad and silent.&#xD;
In her morning ride she had met Dr. Carrington for the first time&#xD;
in four years. Their eyes met for a minute, and she could not&#xD;
forget their sad, reproachful expression as he bowed and passed&#xD;
&#xD;

on. Must she go on thus-living where she might meet him&#xD;
every time she ventured out, and never exchange a word with&#xD;
him ? It was too much--much more than she could bear. Weari-&#xD;
some as the gaieties of Paris had become the winter before, such&#xD;
a life was preferable to the present one. She would tease her&#xD;
father to take her to some Southern city to spend the winter&#xD;
In her wretchedness she had not heard the roar of thunder and&#xD;
rain, until her father called her. She opened the door, and he en-&#xD;
tered, saying, "It is a fearful night, Minnie ; I have looked out&#xD;
until my heart is sick. If I did not believe God's word to be true,&#xD;
I should think this world would be destroyed by water again."&#xD;
"Is the storm so fearful, father ? Is the river rising?" "Rising?,&#xD;
Why, child! where have your thoughts been wandering? Look out&#xD;
from the window and see the destruction going on. Houses are&#xD;
being swept past with -railroad speed'; cattle and horses are&#xD;
whirled past us, pitifully appealing to us for assistance. Trees&#xD;
are torn up by the roots and borne off, together with bridges,&#xD;
mills, and all of the farmers' crops. Look, child! Q, my God!&#xD;
there goes a house with a woman and children screaming for help.&#xD;
I can't bear the sight,"' and he sat down and covered his face with&#xD;
his hands. There was a strange fascination in the war of elements&#xD;
to Minnie. Like a bird charmed by a serpent, she felt all the&#xD;
horrors of the night, yet-could not move from the window. The&#xD;
servants came to tell. her the water was rising in the basement.&#xD;
She merely said, "Take what you can out," and kept her eyes on&#xD;
the river. "Father," she said, "the water does not rise up, it&#xD;
leaps two or three feet at, a time. It is above the cliff, and up to&#xD;
the front steps. The flood-gates of heaven must be opened. Do&#xD;
you think we are in danger?" "No, child, I hope not. Leave&#xD;
the window, Minnie, and come here. I must talk to you some, to-&#xD;
night; sit here beside me. It is a fearful night, and something&#xD;
urges me to tell you the story of my hate. This house is too&#xD;
firmly built to be in danger. - If the water should rise to the second&#xD;
floor, it cannot move. You think me very harsh, and I look back&#xD;
upon my past life and see that I have been, not only harsh, but&#xD;
unjust. Let me begin at the first. I was an only child, but I had&#xD;
a cousin, Mary Morrison, who was five years younger than myself.&#xD;
She was an orphan niece of my mother, a perfect little fairy, who&#xD;
soon became the light of our household.&#xD;

"I was always disposed to rule, to be the tyrant; and while&#xD;
Mary loved me as a brother, she was afraid of me. In childhood&#xD;
I enjoyed having her yield her wishes to mine through fear ; but&#xD;
as I grew up to manhood, and noted her beauty and sweetness of&#xD;
disposition, I wanted to win her affections, and did all that I could&#xD;
to accomplish that object. It was a settled thing with my parents&#xD;
that we should be married when she was eighteen. Well do I&#xD;
remember my twenty-first birthday. My college course was com-&#xD;
pleted, and a classmate whom I loved dearly had come to spend&#xD;
several days with me in hunting and fishing. He had visited me&#xD;
before, and I loved him as much as a selfish, exacting nature like&#xD;
mine could love a brother. But this day of all days !- I had never&#xD;
asked Mary to be my wife. I felt sure she would not refuse me&#xD;
after knowing my parents' wishes, and I-had determined to know,&#xD;
from her own lips, my destiny. She had presented me with a&#xD;
very handsome pair of embroidered slippers, with a card in one&#xD;
upon which was written, 'To my dear brother William, from his&#xD;
sister Mary.'- I did not like her calling me brother. She. had&#xD;
never done so before, and I went in search of her to tell her the&#xD;
dearest gift I could claim from her hands was her priceless love,&#xD;
and nothing less would satisfy me. I found her, but, 0, misery !&#xD;
I found her with the arm of my friend encircling her lovely form,&#xD;
and heard her say to him, 'I have never loved any but you.&#xD;
Cousin William seems too much like a brother, I could not think&#xD;
of wedding him.' I was a madman then, darling. I called my&#xD;
friend a deceiver, a villain, everything, and struck at him in my&#xD;
blind fury. Mary sprang between us, and the blow felled her to&#xD;
the earth. I remember nothing more of what occurred, for a&#xD;
blow'from Charles Carrington's fist laid me low. When. I re-&#xD;
turned to consciousness, I was alone. I went to the house and&#xD;
shocked my poor mother by my wicked oaths of vengeance. -I&#xD;
called for Mary and would have cursed her, but my father, whose&#xD;
will I dared not disobey, forbade my seeing her until I could com-&#xD;
mand my temper. The excitement, together with the blow, caused&#xD;
her to have a long spell of brain fever. When she recovered, my&#xD;
mother took her to Charlottesville, and remained there with her&#xD;
several weeks. During her stay I wrote to her and asked pardon&#xD;
of her for causing her pain, but vowed never to speak to or&#xD;
&#xD;
LOVE AND HATE.&#xD;
&#xD;
175&#xD;
&#xD;
think kindly of Charles Carrington again. I adjured her by all&#xD;
our childhood, by what my parents had done for her, not to&#xD;
marry my enemy, but to return prepared to make my life happy&#xD;
by her love.; and wound up by telling her if she refused the offer I&#xD;
made her, we could never live under the same roof-- no, not one&#xD;
day. Her reply came. It was full of excuses for her lover ; he&#xD;
had never known of my love for her, as I knew I never had a&#xD;
confidant, and did not talk of myself to my most intimate&#xD;
friends. She had not dreamed of any other than a cousinly affec-&#xD;
tion until my mother had told her the day preceding my birthday,&#xD;
and that was why she called me brother, to check any other feel-&#xD;
ing, as her heart had long been given to another. It was a sweet&#xD;
kind letter, and any one but a madman must have pitied the poor&#xD;
creature. I knew she told the truth, yet I cursed her, and impi-&#xD;
ously prayed that the curses of heaven might fall upon her and&#xD;
her chosen. She did not return with my mother, for Charles&#xD;
Carrington married her in Charlottesville and took her home.&#xD;
Charley was a noble man, handsome as Apollo, or as his son,&#xD;
which you may doubt. I have been very harsh and cruel, but to-&#xD;
night, as I look out upon the terrible tempest, I see how impotent&#xD;
is man's wrath, and I believe I can forgive Charley Carrington&#xD;
and his wife."&#xD;
Minnie sat weeping, too absorbed in the story to heed the war&#xD;
of elements without. She felt that the mansion was secure, and&#xD;
feared nothing for her father and herself. She .little knew her&#xD;
peril, until a rap at the back door, a rap loudand emphatic,&#xD;
startled her and she ran to see its cause. When the door was&#xD;
opened, she was'astonished to see a man on horseback, and to hear&#xD;
herself addressed hastily. "Minnie, Miss Erwin, for God's sake&#xD;
save yourself. Where is your father? Be quick, for the out-&#xD;
houses'are being swept away, and the water is above my horse's&#xD;
knees in the back-yard. I have your riding horse here, but no&#xD;
saddle except mine. Throw something around you quickly; I&#xD;
can't assist you, as the horses will not stand in this storm alone."&#xD;
Mr. Erwin had come forward, and hastily-throwing on his ploak&#xD;
while Minnie wrapped a large shawl around her, hastened to the&#xD;
door, and they were assisted to mount, Minnie behind her father&#xD;
on Dr. Carrington's horse, while he rode hers without a saddle.&#xD;

The water was rising rapidly, and before they reached higher&#xD;
ground, had wetted their feet. The servants had left the house&#xD;
without ceremony, some time before. They rode to a neighbor's&#xD;
house a half mile distant, and found shelter and safety from the&#xD;
Y &amp;amp;            storm.&#xD;
When daylight dawned, nothing was 'left of River View NtL&#xD;
a large hole in the washed-out hill-side where it had stood.&#xD;
4   i              Desolation reigned supreme. Whole families were left without&#xD;
shelter and food and w ithout a change of clothing.&#xD;
Mr. Erwin was too thankful for his escape fronr certain death&#xD;
to feel farther anger. When he and his daughter had been saved,&#xD;
and their kind friend saw they needed no farther assistance from&#xD;
him, he started out to try to aid some others who might be in&#xD;
deadly peril. Mr. Erwin grasped him by the arm and said,&#xD;
TYoung man, yon have saved my life, and that of one dearer to&#xD;
me than my own. I feel to-nigl.t that I lve been very wicked,&#xD;
and I ask von to forgive the har hness of a former meeting. Can&#xD;
you forget the past? I had just told my daughter all the fearful&#xD;
story of my wickedness and sin toward your parents. You are&#xD;
going to risk your life to save others. Let us part as friends; and&#xD;
if von live, let us meet again as friends." Charley turned and&#xD;
grasped the hand extended toward him.. He looked at Minnie,&#xD;
who stood trembling near them. Her father held out his hand,&#xD;
and she placed hers in it; he then placed it within that of Dr.&#xD;
Carrington, whose warm clasp closed over it, and he bent his&#xD;
proud head and kissed her brow, as he said: "After all these&#xD;
years of trial! Thank God ! for giving you to me to-night. But&#xD;
I must go, do not be uneasy; life is sweet to me now," and he&#xD;
galloped off to seek new sufferers. There was much to tell when&#xD;
Dr. Carrington returned, but the cup of joy was full when,, a few&#xD;
days later, Mr. and Mrs. Carrington 'came, and would have them&#xD;
to remain with them, in their pleasant home, until a new home&#xD;
could be found. Then Mary Carrington proved a sister indeed,&#xD;
and, to the motherless one, a mother in love and sympathy. Thbe old&#xD;

FEMALE SUF FR A GUE.&#xD;
I feel quite sure of the fact that such a .subject would udt e&#xD;
seriously discussed by the gentlemen of this order-loving commu-&#xD;
nity; but, lest their debate should lead some of the softer sex to&#xD;
think such a thing a "'consunmmation devoutly to be wished "&#xD;
I am constrained to give them a few of my thoughts upon the&#xD;
subject. I believe that all true Southern ladies will unite with&#xD;
me in a protest against the agitation of such a subject.&#xD;
I feel no hesitancy in saying that woin'riis not man's equal&#xD;
mentally. I am not ashamed to acknowledge i y inferiority, nor&#xD;
do I think it any disparagement to our sex. We have separate&#xD;
and distinct spheres of usefulness, and if we fill those spheres as&#xD;
we should, there will be no jealousies arising from conflicting pur-&#xD;
suits. Nature has denied her the physical power necessary for a&#xD;
rivalry with man in the ordinary pursuits of life. I hold the&#xD;
opinion that a woman has the right to make a living for herself&#xD;
and those dependent on her, in any honest way. If she'has no&#xD;
one to provide for her, and Providence seems to design her for a&#xD;
position usually filled by a man, let her not shrink from her duty.&#xD;
Woman was made as a helpmeet for man. Had God intended&#xD;
her to be his equal in every particular, he would have made her&#xD;
as he did man, " of the earth, earthy." As it was, she was taken&#xD;
from his side, that she might be ever near his heart; from under&#xD;
his arm, that he might shield and protect her by his superior&#xD;
strength.&#xD;
What was Mrs. Adam's occupation in the garden of Eden?&#xD;
Was it to.entertain her angel visitors with complaints that her&#xD;
lord did not accord to her equal rights? (Perhaps it had been&#xD;
better for us all had she been permitted to have fewer privileges.)&#xD;

Let us see what Milton says she was doing when Adam was ex-&#xD;
pecting an angelic visitor.&#xD;
"And Eve within, due at her hour, prepared&#xD;
For'inner savory fruits of tastg to please&#xD;
True appetite.&#xD;
To whom thus Adam called:&#xD;
Haste hither, Eve, and, worth thy sight, behold&#xD;
Eastward, among those trees, what glorious shape&#xD;
Comes this way moving. * *  * *&#xD;
But go with speed.&#xD;
And,.what thy stores contain, bring forth&#xD;
Abundance, fit to honor and receive&#xD;
Our heavenly visitor."'&#xD;
This was anterior to the mighty fall, therefore her housekeep-&#xD;
ing was not enjoined as-a punishment, but' must have been the&#xD;
part assigned hey by her Creator, and she very evidently consid-&#xD;
ered it a labor of love until, the arch-enemy of human happiness&#xD;
tempted her, as he has been doing ever since, to try to become&#xD;
even the equal of.God.&#xD;
Fannie Fern says that men are precious fools sometimes&#xD;
(pardon me for jumping from Milton to Fannie Fern), but I thin&#xD;
the serpent must have been very subtle indeed to know so well&#xD;
that his surest way of success lay in attacking the weaker vessel,&#xD;
I do not believe he could have beguiled man in any other form&#xD;
than that of woman. St. Paul tells us that the husband is the&#xD;
head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the Church, and the&#xD;
wife should see that she reverence her husband. Now, how is it&#xD;
possible for us to reverence our equals? True, we would scorn&#xD;
the idea of being the equals of some we have seen who call them-&#xD;
selves men; but we mean men such as God made them. I believe&#xD;
it is generally accorded to us that our intuitions are more gener-&#xD;
ally correct than those of man ;-still we do not reason as man&#xD;
does. We are too prone to jump at conclusions, and take our&#xD;
first impulses for our 'guide or rule of action. I do not believe&#xD;
we could be strictly just as jurors or judges. .Our hearts are too&#xD;
tender for that, and our prejudices too strong. We do-not yield&#xD;
to man any superiority wiithin our sphere, and we look down&#xD;
with sovereign contempt upon such as would .contest our rights&#xD;
within that sphere. A woman who attempts to place herself upon&#xD;

&#xD;
an equal footing with man is an object of ridicule; btt a tman&#xD;
who stoops to our peculiar sphere is too contemptil)ie for even&#xD;
pity.  We know full well, 0 man, our- weakness and your&#xD;
strength, and are not willing to enter the political arena with you.&#xD;
Our rights are too holy to be mixed up with anything so debas-&#xD;
ing as politics. In all civilised countries man has placed us upon&#xD;
a lofty throne, the highest place in his affections. Let us be con-&#xD;
tent to be "the power behind the throne." Love and sympathy&#xD;
constitute our atmosphere, and we cannot breathe healthfully in&#xD;
any other.&#xD;
The voice of fame is sweet, very sweet, but it cannot satisfy&#xD;
the cravings of a woman's heart. The poetess may revel amid&#xD;
the delights of fairy land,1may explore the fairfields of imagina-&#xD;
tion, and drink intoxicating draughts from the fount of Castalia.&#xD;
She may think she is happy while in the solitude of her chamber&#xD;
she pores over, Spenser, Milton, Shakspeare, &amp;amp;c., &amp;amp;c. She may&#xD;
follow Lalla Rookh in her travels through the Happy Valley, sit&#xD;
beside Ellen Douglas as she rows her light skiff over the beautiful&#xD;
lake, or roam with Shelley through the weird but fascinati g field&#xD;
of fancy ; but without congenial companionship, all this leasure&#xD;
palls upon her senses, and a raven is ever croaking hoarsely at&#xD;
her door "Nevermore," until heartsick and weary she prays to&#xD;
die.&#xD;
There may be a stern satisfaction in some women in being&#xD;
able to tear the tendrils of their hearts away from all support,'&#xD;
and let them trail in the dust or snap them ruthlessly asunder,&#xD;
until they become seared and hard as adamant. Do what we will&#xD;
and seem what we may, there are hours when even the breath of&#xD;
fame seems a sirocco to burn up heart and brain, and we cry out&#xD;
in bitteianguish for a little spot somewhere in this wide world to&#xD;
call our home, for a strong arm to lean upon, and a noble heart&#xD;
to love us above all the world. What were literary or political'.&#xD;
honors to a heart starving for affection ?&#xD;
Let politics alone, my sisters. Improve your minds so as to&#xD;
be ple sant companions..for your gentleman friends. Let your&#xD;
modesty, intelligence, and affectionate reverence be the magnet&#xD;
which is to draw your husbands and brothers from all places of&#xD;
vice to a miniature paradise, a home such as nature and inspira-&#xD;
tion teach us we were made to create for our masters.&#xD;

St. Paul tells us" (and he is very good authority, I think,) that&#xD;
it is a shame for a woman to speak in church. What would he&#xD;
have said had he heard of such a thing as a " Womrjan's Rights&#xD;
Convention "? Is it not much more a shame for a woman to&#xD;
harangue an audience upon political subjects ? I consider it a&#xD;
very doubtful honor for a man to be made the equal of a negro;&#xD;
but, from elbowing our way through a crowd of negroes and&#xD;
vulgar white men to the polls, " angels and ministers of grace de-&#xD;
fend us!"&#xD;
To the gentlemen who advocate our political equality, I say,&#xD;
beware what-you do. You, surely, do not know the extent of our&#xD;
ambition; when once aroused, it is as boundless as the universe,&#xD;
and like the mountain torrent, sweeps everything before it. We&#xD;
will not be content with any half-way privileges. Give us the&#xD;
right to vote, and we claim the right to hold office, also to elec-&#xD;
tioneer, to frequent court-houses and bar-rooms, and treat, which&#xD;
seems such a delectable privilege to our male friends; to keep our&#xD;
riding horses, and have our law and medical offices; and, as our&#xD;
sex has the majority, besides those of the gentlemen who could&#xD;
not vote against " a lady," we are sure to get all the best offices,&#xD;
while the men will be forced to our many expedients to make a&#xD;
living. Should our very wise handling of the reins of govern-&#xD;
nent bring on civil or foreign wars, we claim the privilege to&#xD;
fight, bleed and die for our country. Of course, as in civil affairs,&#xD;
we expect to have the fat offices. We will be quarter-mistresses,&#xD;
commissaries, surgeons and chaplains. Some of us will be field&#xD;
officers, while our poor husbands or lovers must shoulder their&#xD;
muskets, or perhaps be detailed as our servants to clean our&#xD;
boots, and keep our horses and arms in order. Some one might&#xD;
ask what is to become of home, the chickens, &amp;amp;c. 0, that-camfbe&#xD;
easily arranged. We can get some maiden sister or aunt or&#xD;
grandmother, who is muster free, to take our places; or, may be&#xD;
those of the lords of creation who claim exemption from military&#xD;
duty can be hired as substitutes to stay at home. 0, won't that be&#xD;
a delightful time!  ware, I say, gentlemen ; we might become&#xD;
so contaminated as to learn to swear and chew tobacco !&#xD;
