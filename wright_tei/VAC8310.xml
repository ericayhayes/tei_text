THE PROPOSITION.&#xD;
[~OTHER, has Ernest come ?" said Grace&#xD;
Winthrop, as she came into the cool milk-&#xD;
room, here, with housewifely pride, a quiet ma-&#xD;
t on stood counting the bright rows of tin pans&#xD;
which adorned the shelves.&#xD;
"Ernest!" said her mother, as .if only a sound&#xD;
fell on her occupied thoughts. "Twenty-four pans&#xD;
of mil ; the weather is' getting so warm that I&#xD;
must make cheese instead of butter this week.''&#xD;
"Why, mother ! you seem to dare more for the&#xD;
butter and cheese than you do for me. I have been&#xD;
waiting for Ernest a long time. I thought it was&#xD;
such a lovely evening he would take me to Julia&#xD;
Thorn's."&#xD;
" I haven't seen him, child, since he came in to&#xD;
supper, I suppose he, is very'tired, and perhaps&#xD;
gone to bed.. You are rather late. -Was n't grand-&#xD;
ma as well as usual?"&#xD;
Ye;ma'am; but; I thought father told Ernest&#xD;
he must go to mill after supper. I waited to ride&#xD;
home with him. Ukcle Henry .came with me to.&#xD;

the foot of'ttie hill. -I'm sorry Ernest has gom&#xD;
bed, wanted to see Julia a little while to-night&#xD;
erhaps he has not. I've been too busy to&#xD;
hi    You can surely find him if-you set a&#xD;
it."&#xD;
On went Grace through the great, old kitc&#xD;
through the sitting-room beyond, and out into&#xD;
porch.&#xD;
This porch fwas a cool, inviting. place,&#xD;
benches on each side of it. Its cover was a qu&#xD;
gable roof, shiglding it from the broad sunli&#xD;
and from the storm. Lilac bushes grown to tr&#xD;
threw their Fragrance into it in May, and&#xD;
double roses' 'udded, blossomed, and scattered t&#xD;
fading leaves on its benches and floor in J&#xD;
Just outside the gate, stood an i old elm tree&#xD;
broad-spreadipg that its shadows fell over the w&#xD;
front of the house and covered the little yard;&#xD;
night it let the moonbeams through, reveal&#xD;
Ernest, sitting without his' coat, on the stone s&#xD;
of the porch, his elbows resting on his knees,&#xD;
his face covered with his hands.&#xD;
' Here you. are, naughty brother !" said Gr&#xD;
coming close up to him. "Why did n't you&#xD;
to' mill, I waited a great while for you. I&#xD;
Juli4 .Thorn this morning, and told her I thou&#xD;
we would con;e there this evening."&#xD;
. "You must not make any promises for me, Gr&#xD;
until harvest is over. Yeu know I'm too harc&#xD;
work all day to care to .go ou't evenings. A&#xD;
oh ! I do get so tired of this perpetual round&#xD;
sowing and reaping ; it's plant, and hoe, and si&#xD;
and mow, until I sometimes wish I was in the mt&#xD;

"No!" said Grace, in a half whisper, as if&#xD;

"Well, then, I've got a plan in my head.&#xD;
not mean to tell you quite yet, but you are so&#xD;
to see a way out of difficulties, that I might a&#xD;
engage your services."&#xD;
"Not to g~o away from home, Ernest."&#xD;
"Hush, Grace! don't you speak so lou&#xD;
have n't forrped any plans yet. I was only&#xD;
to tell you what I keep thinking about. Youk&#xD;
father sometimes speaks of his brother Edw&#xD;
who lives in Boston. I heard him tell mothe&#xD;
night that he had not been at home in twenty y&#xD;
they were wondering why he never comes ba&#xD;
the old place. Father said he -supposed his&#xD;
tion, to business first took all of his time, and&#xD;
his habits were different from the old ways at h&#xD;
and all his 'nterests were different. Mother&#xD;
she should like to see him once more, but she&#xD;
posed she never should. 'No,' said father,&#xD;
and I shall never look him up, but: some o&#xD;
boys may' That thought was just the thi&#xD;
needed. ather little-dreamed what he was&#xD;
for me when Sie said it. I have been fully deter&#xD;

Ernest looked u  with a start. He had great&#xD;

but now he.though her enthusiasm had bewildered&#xD;
her judgment,-and all of his plans were spoilt by&#xD;
this premature dis losure. But Grace was clear-&#xD;

very nicely. Of course, I wouldn't think of your&#xD;

patted the fair cheek.&#xD;
" Wait a  minute, mother. Promis&#xD;

"Come where? I'm sure I don't know what&#xD;
new idea has got into your head since you went to&#xD;
grandmother's this morning. Have grandfather&#xD;
and grandmother taken it into their heads to go&#xD;
traveling, and want you to go with them?"&#xD;
"No, Annie! Ernest and I are going," and then,&#xD;
as quickly as possible, she told the delightful plan&#xD;
which by this time seemed to belong to her as&#xD;
much as it did to her brother.&#xD;
Mrs. Winthrop and Annie exchanged glances ;&#xD;
they were accustomed to Grace's rapid conclu-&#xD;
sions, and, strange to say, were often oblig d to&#xD;
admit their correctness; but this one did \$eem&#xD;
rather wild and made no deep impression on moth.&#xD;
er or daughter.&#xD;
1Irs. Winthrop ended the evening's consultation&#xD;
by saying, "It is too late to talk any longer, we&#xD;
must all go to bed; this sitting up late in harvest&#xD;
time will never answer."&#xD;
"Good night, Ernest," said Grace, and leaning&#xD;
over to him she whispered, "are you sorry I'm&#xD;
going with you ?"&#xD;
"Going with me ! Judging from your success -&#xD;
to-night, I think I see us both going."&#xD;
"Don't give up so. I believe we shall go. I&#xD;
wish mother would not call us children. I know,&#xD;
she only means me when she says it. She thinks&#xD;

You are nqt vexed with me for telling, are you ?"&#xD;
"No; I dbn't think it will make much difference&#xD;
in the end ; but I thought you told me good night.&#xD;
As mother says, 'it's time to go to bed.' "&#xD;
"Good night, then." And as Ernest heard her&#xD;
light Footsteps on the stairs,. he could not help&#xD;
thinking she was a sister of who  any brother&#xD;
might be proud.&#xD;
"She is provoking sometimes but she does&#xD;
carry her points even with our goo mother; 'and&#xD;
I should no' wonder if in the end I found myself&#xD;
with her on the way-to Uncle Edward's."&#xD;
Two hours later the tall old clock, which had al-&#xD;
ready measured off the years of'one generation,&#xD;
strikes twelVe. The moon shines quietly through&#xD;
the many-le tved elm, and throws shadows all over&#xD;

CHAPTER II&#xD;
INTRODUCTION TO' THE FAMILY.&#xD;
IXTE must first seek an introduction to the head&#xD;
of the household, good Deacon Winthrop.&#xD;
The evening our story' commenced he was too&#xD;
tired to find any rest i the old  orch ; but to-&#xD;
day he is taking his" nooning" in the oaken chair,&#xD;
and while he dozes we can tell you that he is the&#xD;
youngest of a family of six brot ers, all born in&#xD;
this same old mansion. By the ommon routine&#xD;
of human events, he has come t6 be his father's&#xD;
successor at the homestead. The other brothers,&#xD;
except one who died in early life, have wandered&#xD;
away. and found homes and employment in new&#xD;
places-all enterprising men. By careful industry&#xD;
Henry, now Deacon     inthrop, has added his&#xD;
brothers' portions to hi own until nearly all the&#xD;
paternal acres are in h s possession. He is not a&#xD;
man of many words, b t he is known to possess a&#xD;
clear, consistent Crsincharacter..&#xD;
The Bible "is to him tl e foundation of all knowl-&#xD;
edge. No season is sq hurried that he does riot&#xD;
find time to open its pates and gather at least one&#xD;
precious morsel to swee en his daily toil. Elevated&#xD;

in caring for her children; they were "the joy of&#xD;
her heart," and "the light of her dwelling." Still&#xD;
she was so oppressed with care and the many de-&#xD;
mands on her time, that she did not often unbend&#xD;
in playfulness, except with mirth-provoking Grace!&#xD;
Annie, the eldest child, was now twenty. She&#xD;
possessed all her mother's housewifely attributes.&#xD;
She was a perfect home treasure, caring for her&#xD;
brothers and sisters with almost maternal tender-&#xD;
ness. ." And yet,."\ she would sometimes say to&#xD;
Ernest, "I don't know how it is, father and mother&#xD;
seem to have great confidence in me, but Grace&#xD;
can accomplish more with them than I can."&#xD;
Ernest was a fine specimen of a New England&#xD;
youth fifty years ago-a son in; whom his parents&#xD;
found rest. During the summer months he worked&#xD;
on .the farm, and in the winter he attended school.&#xD;
His face was noble and ianly, and his form finely'&#xD;
developed; his words were much more abundant&#xD;
than his father's. A stranger would have thought&#xD;
him more accessible. As we have learned from his&#xD;
conversation with Grace, he was not fully content&#xD;
in his present mode of life, and was far from being&#xD;
a fixture in it. He' had made up his mind to teach&#xD;
school the coming winter, and before that time to&#xD;
get a sight of the world beyond Eagle Mountain.&#xD;
Grace! I hardly know how to present her, s e&#xD;
was so like and so unlike the rest ofthe hoseholi.&#xD;
Her face was very fair, and her violet eyed pal d&#xD;
and darkened with her different emotions. She&#xD;
was full of vivacity, kindling and sparkling in the&#xD;
life about her; ever respectful to her father and-&#xD;
mother, but encountering. their opinions with 'a&#xD;

seemed to have no liking for the dai&#xD;
farm life, and sometimes called forth I&#xD;
disapprobatic n at her s-eemingly was-&#xD;
then she was so full of expedients-so&#xD;

Her presence was felt throughout t&#xD;
little tasteful decorations. Seldom a&#xD;
when flowers grew, but they bloome&#xD;
bunches on she high mantle-shelf in&#xD;

The big double roses, the pinks and&#xD;

23&#xD;
&#xD;
monized finely and balanced well. His advice&#xD;
often modified her schemes, and her disregard for&#xD;
petty annoyances helped him cheerfully over many&#xD;
difficulties. Life at Deacon Winthrop's involved&#xD;
great economy .and care. The sheep contributed&#xD;
their share of food and raiment, the cows yielded&#xD;
stores of milk, butter and cheese.&#xD;
It was, as Grace had said, a busy. household;&#xD;
but it was the abode of cheerfulness and refine-&#xD;
ment-a refinement which being inborn, a native&#xD;
element of the, soul, developed itself as clearly as&#xD;
if its revelation were made through the medium&#xD;
of more costly surroundings.&#xD;
Now the ever watchful old clock strikes the&#xD;
early morning hour, and all through the east rosy&#xD;
tintings outskirt the dawning of another glorious&#xD;
summer day, and rouse the different members of&#xD;
'the refreshed household to their allotted tasks.&#xD;
Grace's first thought was of that wonderful journey&#xD;
in October, and how it was. to be accomplished.&#xD;
"I'll begin on the flax," thought she. " Mother&#xD;
expects to tell me about it, and wonder why I do&#xD;
not keep at it just as Annie would. She will be&#xD;
surprised if I get it done before bleaching -time&#xD;
next spring. Now, I will try and. let her see how&#xD;
well I can do a thing if I really set about it. ±.I'll&#xD;
make my fingers fly and the wheel,'too."'&#xD;
Annie, who was an early riser, had.not yet gone&#xD;
down; so Grace b unded out, of bed, and, quickly&#xD;
dressing herself, w nt up to the garret to recon-&#xD;
noitre.&#xD;
Close by the chimneystood the wheel, with its&#xD;
empty distaff; there lay the bundle of flax, and&#xD;

bring the wheel close to the little&#xD;

in the early morning, felt confine&#xD;
She wanted deep, full breaths. She&#xD;

Aunt Nannie's "out-room," where&#xD;
new-mown hay came in so refreshin&#xD;
she would be as welcome as the bird&#xD;

coming from Aunt Nannie's every&#xD;

would spoil the secret pleasure she&#xD;
have in doing her work.&#xD;
She thought of another plan-bey&#xD;

heard the call&#xD;
&#xD;
to breakfast. She' had fully intended to be ready&#xD;
for her share of the \morning work down-stairs,&#xD;
but the time had gone faster than she thought, and&#xD;
here she was late at breakfast.&#xD;
" Idid not' knew but you had gone to Boston,"&#xD;
said Ernest, in a quiet undertone, as she took her&#xD;
seat beside him at the table.&#xD;
An appreciating smile was all the return she had&#xD;
time to make when her mother said: "I doubt if&#xD;
it is a good plan for you to sit up so late at night&#xD;
planning to go off visiting. I wondered why you&#xD;
did not come to set the table and help about break-&#xD;
fast."&#xD;
"She got up before I did," said Annie. "I'm&#xD;
sure I don't knox;i what she could have been do-&#xD;
ing."&#xD;
Grace wanted to excuse herself very much, but&#xD;
that would be spoiling it all; so she said, with her&#xD;
usual vivacity, " I'll make it all up to-day, mother;&#xD;
and to - morrow morning I'll get breakfast before&#xD;
the cock crows if you want me to."&#xD;
"Take care," said Deacon Winthrop, smilingly.&#xD;
"Mother believes in more moderation than that.&#xD;
An early breakfast now and then would never suit&#xD;
her. She likes things in an even way."&#xD;
" That is Annie" thought Grace. "I wonder,&#xD;
if I shall ever get 4n the 'even way.'"&#xD;
Breakfast and prayers were over, and the busy&#xD;
household went to their daily tasks. Only Arthur&#xD;
and .Mary went to school durin' these harvest&#xD;
days; the others were large enough to be very&#xD;
serviceable to their father and b other. Arthur&#xD;
and Mary had their tasks, too, for they fed the&#xD;

chickens and the ducks, the turkeys and the gos-&#xD;
lings ; they gathered the eggs, and saved many a&#xD;
step for the weary 'feet of their mother. Grace&#xD;
superintended their simple toilette, filled their&#xD;
lunch-basket for school, and then went hither and&#xD;
thither doing nameless necessary things. Mrs.&#xD;
Winthrop proceeded with her cheese -making,&#xD;
which was, indeed, a wonderful process.  She,&#xD;
managed it so nicely that it did not really seem a&#xD;
great deal of trouble. She had a way of doing&#xD;
things quietly, and as the snow- white curd was&#xD;
separated from the watery portions .of the. milk,&#xD;
she packed it into a strong cloth, inclosed it in a&#xD;
hoop to give it shape, and put it under a heavy&#xD;
weight to press, and was glad so.much of the day's&#xD;
work was done.&#xD;
Annie, meantime, was busy preparing the sub-&#xD;
stantial ginger -bread for the field lunch. In har-&#xD;
vest days extra food was necessary. Cake and&#xD;
cheese, and a most excellent root-beer, which Mrs.&#xD;
Winthrop knew just how to ,compound, formed a&#xD;
substantial repast between the early breakfast and&#xD;
the dinner. Charles came for the basket, which&#xD;
was always in readiness to be sent into the field by&#xD;
half-past ten, and then came the preparations for&#xD;
dinner, followed by that peculiar stillness which&#xD;
foretells the coming noon in the country.&#xD;
"1What is Grace doing up-stairs ?" said Mrs.&#xD;
Winthrop.   "I want her to go over to Aunt&#xD;
Nannie's for some sassafras root for the beer. I&#xD;
see the last I made is almost one."-&#xD;

the Winthrop household.  They knew how to&#xD;
bleach it too. Aunt Nannie kept a-good look-out&#xD;
for "bleaching time." She knew just when the&#xD;
sun would do such work most effectually. The&#xD;
busy hum of their wheel might be heard. many&#xD;
hours of the winter's day, as they drew out and&#xD;
twisted into threads the wool and the flax. Then,&#xD;
in summer, how Aunt Lois worked in the garden !&#xD;
Charles and Henry made it, but she kept it in or-&#xD;
der. She had "alley beds," where the pinks and&#xD;
sweet Williams, the poppies and red and white&#xD;
hollyhocks grew in profusion. There were daffo-&#xD;
dills and ladies'- slippers, and such a wealth of&#xD;
roses ! Aunt Lois loved flowers as she did the sun-&#xD;
shine, and they always seemed to grow wherever&#xD;
she put them. AuntLois and flowers were always&#xD;
associated in Grace's mind, and from her she had&#xD;
learned many things about them. From her earliest&#xD;
childhood she never went in summer time, even on&#xD;
a hasty errand, that Aunt Lois did not find time to&#xD;
give her a "posy just to smell of," and then to go&#xD;
with her after wild flowers! It was astonishing what&#xD;
treasures she found hidden under dry leaves in&#xD;
early spring, so delicate that the wind would almost&#xD;
blow them away. Grace always accompanied her&#xD;
on these occasions. They were perpetual sources&#xD;
of pleasure to .her. Sometimes, in autumn days,&#xD;
she would come home wreathed in clematis, and&#xD;
wearing necklace and bracelets of spice-woo'dber-&#xD;
ries. Aunt Lois never thought these devices were&#xD;
Tfolish; she had an eye for the beautiful, and some-&#xD;
times she would tell Nannie that '"it beat all how&#xD;
that child would- rig- up in flowers, and look as&#xD;
handsome as a picture."&#xD;

leisure in the afternoon. From  he time the&#xD;

a comparative calm. In this time Grace expected'&#xD;
to, spin, without being observed. This, added to'&#xD;

Bible, with notes. A few high-backec chairs were&#xD;
ranged round the room, and before t e front win-&#xD;
dow was an armed-chair. The chief rnament was&#xD;
the open fireplace, in which stood a ja always filled&#xD;
in summer-time with sprays of feathery asparagus,&#xD;
enlivened by the different flowers, in their season.&#xD;
It was Grace's especial delight to make this fire-&#xD;
place very blooming every Saturday afternoon, for&#xD;
after the early Sunday supper the w ndows were'&#xD;
opened, and all the family gathered  ere to read&#xD;
from the sacred pages of that holy bo k which was&#xD;
so surely preparing them for life's conflicts, and&#xD;
giving them power to triumph over t em.&#xD;
The hymn and prayer that follow d were like&#xD;
invisible cords drawing these young hearts up to&#xD;

'their hospitalities. The children remeibered-when&#xD;

with closed eyes and folded hands under the mir-&#xD;
ror between the windows, and bee  borne from&#xD;
thence to rest under the green sod by the valley&#xD;
church! We will not enter this quiet, darkened&#xD;
room to-day, but come into the porch where Mrs.&#xD;
Winthrop is sitting. Her simple afternoon toilette&#xD;
is made, and her mending-basket is beside her.&#xD;
Annie is here, too, with busy fingers remodeling&#xD;
a garment for 'one of the boys. 'Grac 's chair and'&#xD;

"Grace must help rpe mend, this afternoon," said&#xD;
Mrs. Winthrop.. "What do you suppose she is.'do&#xD;
ing, Annie ?"&#xD;
"Coming to help you, mother," said Grace; en!&#xD;
tearing that moment and holding out her finished&#xD;
task for her mother's inspection.&#xD;
" Really.!" said Mrs. Winthrop,-as she passed her&#xD;
fingers over the smooth brown threads, "this is&#xD;
very neatly done, and I am pleased with your per-&#xD;
severance. I knew you were able to accomplish.&#xD;
any thing that could be done in a hurry, but I did&#xD;
not believe you would get up an hour earlier thar&#xD;
usual for six weeks, and actually finish the flax."&#xD;
"Annie, you are too bad ! Did you tell mother&#xD;
about my getti g up?"&#xD;
"No; Annie has never said a word to me about&#xD;
it; but do you oppose I have no thought for what&#xD;
is going on up- tairs? I know when my children&#xD;
try to do well."&#xD;
Mrs. Winthrop laic the skeins on the bench beJ&#xD;
side her, and Grace kegan looking over the basket&#xD;
for such article as needed her fingers most. There&#xD;
'was -a quiet snile on Annie's face, for she knew&#xD;
that Grace had pome to the point where the never-&#xD;
forgotten subject of the journey was to be agitated.&#xD;
They sat q quietly sewing, when Grace said,&#xD;
''Mother, have you ever talked with father about&#xD;
our going to Uncle Edward's in October ?"&#xD;
" Hav'n't you forgotten that wild notion ?" And.&#xD;

had long talks about it, but we resolved to keep it&#xD;
all to ourselves until I finished this work; we have&#xD;
planned and planned until we, know the way ; just&#xD;
where we are going to stop at night; what we are&#xD;
going to do when we get there; an   all about&#xD;
uncle and aunt and Cousin Laura." And Grace&#xD;
fairly caught her breath in her eagerness to show&#xD;
how every difficulty was removed.&#xD;
" I anx afraid you have forgotten th  money to&#xD;
pay the way,(and the clothes to wear when you&#xD;
get there ; btt how did you make so sure of the&#xD;
way ?"&#xD;
"Ernest has inquired of Edward Nelson's uncle ;&#xD;
he has been there two or three times. If we only&#xD;
had a carriage, we should be almost re dy to start.&#xD;
Ernest says 'Fearnaught' is handsom  enough to&#xD;
drive anywhere; but the wagon w uld not be&#xD;
comfortable for such a journey, besi es it might&#xD;
not look very nicely driving up to Un le Edward's&#xD;
door."&#xD;
Grace paused, feeling that she had g ined an im-&#xD;
portant point; her mother actually 1 stened ; and&#xD;
she had at least an opportunity tq d sclose plans&#xD;
which she and Ernest had come to thi k very com-&#xD;
plete. She knew where it was possi le to obtain&#xD;
the very carriage they wanted. A  riend of her&#xD;
mother's, a widow lady, owned a neat wo-wheeled&#xD;
gig-a great rarity in those days, a there were&#xD;
only three in the whole town. She t ought if her&#xD;
father should ask for this for a couple of weeks, it&#xD;
was possible he might get it. Ernest as not quite&#xD;
so sanguine ; he called it a good sug estion-just&#xD;
the thing. Grace had drawn such  lowing pic-&#xD;
&#xD;
tures of their ride, and the delightful, wonderful&#xD;
visit they were going to have, that he had come to&#xD;
regard her as quite a necessary part of it.&#xD;
"I should like to hear of the road you would&#xD;
take and where you stop over-night," said Mrs.&#xD;
Winthrop, quietly.&#xD;
Now was Grace's opportunity. Down went her&#xD;
work, and her violet eyes grew intense in their ex-&#xD;
pression.&#xD;
Ernest says we must be about three days and a&#xD;
half going. We can have an early dinner and go&#xD;
as far as Dover the first. day. I know Cousin&#xD;
George and his wife will be glad to see us, for&#xD;
when they used, to come here and we were only&#xD;
little children, they asked us to make them a&#xD;
visit whenever you would let us come. I remem-&#xD;
ber Cousin Sarah was very'pleasant; don't you,&#xD;
Annie?"&#xD;
"Yes," said. Aiinie. "I went there -once with&#xD;
father and mother when I was quite srdall. But&#xD;
what would you do after you had stayed there one&#xD;
night ?&#xD;
"A bout fifty miles from Dover," continued&#xD;
Grac , with the air of one who had learned her les-&#xD;
son p rfectly, "father's Uncle Josiah lives."&#xD;
Here Mrs. Winthrop smiled, and Annie remark-&#xD;
ed, "Relations are very convenient when they live&#xD;
on the way. Uncle Josiah would not know you,&#xD;
and perhaps after your long ride, he would not&#xD;
take you in.&#xD;
"'Yes he would; we could soon convince him&#xD;

"Why ! isn't Uncle Edward father's&#xD;

S     her statement of Grace's sudden announcement.&#xD;
He did not see how the journey could be perform-&#xD;

errands that came into their daily life, enjoying&#xD;
many pleasures and sharing many privations. Then&#xD;
the long years of their separation, unintentional on&#xD;
either side, might be bridged by consenting to this&#xD;
visit ; perhaps he should behold his brother's face&#xD;
once more at the old homestead. The more he&#xD;
thought of it the more he inclined not.only to give&#xD;
his consent, but to aid their going.&#xD;
Mrs. Winthrop raised-many objections.. She had&#xD;
never been much of a travele , and she did not see&#xD;
how "these children" could go so far from home&#xD;
alone. Her husand's judgment was a very safe&#xD;
starting point, a id from it she gradually came to&#xD;
think that if Grace could make he way reasonably&#xD;
plain, she would not oppose their going. This is&#xD;
why fshe listened with so much real interest to the&#xD;
plan of the proposed journey. She had-talked it&#xD;
over with Annie, who thought it a great under-&#xD;
taking, but if they were disposed to go, and father&#xD;
did not object, it was best to help them off. -To&#xD;

Grace's delight, her mother made no great objec-&#xD;
tions. She only said, " I can't promise, but you&#xD;
may ask your father, and if he thinks that Ernest&#xD;
can take good care of you and find the way there,&#xD;
perhaps I shall give my consent ;-tak care ! t ke&#xD;
care.! there goes the mending basket.&#xD;
Sure enough, it had gone over, and all its con-&#xD;
tents weresan the floor. Grace could not sit still&#xD;
and hear so much of an assent from her mother,&#xD;
and the basket did not know enough to hold fast&#xD;
to the bench on which it stood, when in her joyful&#xD;
uprising she bounded against it. So down it came,&#xD;
and our young lady had to restore order, but she,&#xD;
made such slow progress that Mrs.  inthrop sent&#xD;
her to get supper, which her father wanted earlier&#xD;
than usual.&#xD;
It came about soon after supper  eacon Win-&#xD;
throp.had gone out into the porch o rest in the&#xD;
oaken chair. Grace had waited for his opportu-&#xD;
nity ; so she sat down on the bench beside him and&#xD;
told him how much she and Ernest anted to go&#xD;
to Boston, and how they had planned to go, if&#xD;
he would only give his consent. 1e heard her&#xD;
through, and then came the usual question, "What&#xD;
does your mother say ?"&#xD;
"She told me to ask you."&#xD;
"Well, if she is willing and you w11 promise to&#xD;
do me credit with Uncle Edward, I wil1 let you go."&#xD;
Deacon Winthrop smiled at the bright face which&#xD;
for a moment was turned in its unspeakable pleas-&#xD;
ure towards him. He fully believed he would do&#xD;
him credit anywhere, and then he heard the clear&#xD;
ringing voice saying,-&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
FIFTY YEARS AGO.            39&#xD;
"Mother! mother ! father says we may to.&#xD;
Where is Annie ?"&#xD;
" What ails Grace ?".said Arthur. "She nearly&#xD;
i    pushed me into this pail of milk ;" but Grace had&#xD;
gone, and her light step might have been heard&#xD;
around the corner of the barn, where Ernest was&#xD;
unharnessing the horse.&#xD;
"Ernest ! Ernest !" said' she,. "we are going to&#xD;
Boston !-father and mother both say so&#xD;
"Really, Grace !-does mother say so ?".&#xD;
"-I had a 'talk with her this afternoon and she&#xD;
told me to ask father. I asked him just now and&#xD;
he gave his consent, and we are really going," said&#xD;
she, dancing along and clasping his neck in the&#xD;
outgoings of her joy.&#xD;
"Wait until I put Fearnaught into pasture, and&#xD;
then come and sit in the wagon and tell mne how&#xD;
you brought it all about."&#xD;
The wagon was rolled under its customary cover,&#xD;
and then, away from all the family, Grace related&#xD;
to her equally interested brother, the story of her&#xD;
triumph. "Now, I am sure, you are glad I invited&#xD;
myself to go v ith you," said she, as they walked&#xD;
slowly into th house.&#xD;
"Of course I am," said Ernest, " but who would&#xD;
have thought father and mother would consent!&#xD;
Your are 'a clever sort of girl, and I don't know&#xD;
but your' way of going right at a thing will accom&#xD;
plish the most in the end."&#xD;
After a due amount of talking, it was settled that&#xD;
our young friends should leave home the first day&#xD;
of October. Mrs. Winthrop had many misgivings,&#xD;
but her husband was so cheerful about it~ that she&#xD;

it. She had been trained in a household where&#xD;
the texture  and shape of the outer garment did not&#xD;
comprise the highest aspirations of the soul. So&#xD;
she had a joy independent of them.&#xD;
Leave we now the preparations,  nd hasten on&#xD;
with the days until they usher in the first day of&#xD;
October.&#xD;
It is plain the glorious morning heralds some. un-&#xD;
u sual event at the Winthrop mansion. Aunt Nan-&#xD;

c sionally strengthening each other by wondering&#xD;
h w I1Vis' Winthrop " could give her consent to&#xD;

rs. Winthrop is busy with various things at the&#xD;
kitchen-table. Annie is packing a small trunk up-&#xD;
stairs, and Grace is dressing in her very "Sunday&#xD;
best." The childre  are everywhere, full of ex-&#xD;
ci ement, they run up and down stairs, from the&#xD;
k tchen to.Grace's rom, hindering every body.&#xD;
With a sudden shout, Henry and Arthur go leap-&#xD;
i g down stairs, and out the door. Ernest has just&#xD;
d iven up with Mrs. Wheeler's shining gig, and&#xD;
h ndsome Fearnaught harnessed before it. How&#xD;
the daring request for the use of that gig was ever&#xD;
g anted, nobody seemed to know. Ernest under-&#xD;

to see if he could make out what v&#xD;

them forward. He was so used to t&#xD;
family, that he seemed to know tL&#xD;
more than usual was going to happ&#xD;
dren patted his velvet nose, hugge&#xD;
neck, and looked into his great, tru&#xD;
whether this meant they were goin&#xD;
going, he could not make out. H&#xD;
ticed the shining gig, to him it was t&#xD;

On the table in the kitchen stood&#xD;

as going on,&#xD;
then brought&#xD;

or he was&#xD;
had not no-&#xD;
e same as the&#xD;
two baskets,&#xD;
&#xD;
which Mrs. Winthrop's motherly hands had packed.&#xD;
She called Grace to come and look into them.&#xD;
"Ii' this basket are two chickens, icely roasted,&#xD;
with plenty of bread and butter filled in ; and in&#xD;
that one, you will find cake and cheese. Aunt&#xD;
Lois brought over a pan of crullers. I have put&#xD;
in as many as I could."&#xD;
"Thank you, mother! I knew you would never&#xD;
send us away empty. Ernest will like this, I am&#xD;
sure."&#xD;
"Yes, indeed," said Ernest, coming in .at that&#xD;
moment," mother knows how to help travelers off."&#xD;
It was soon time for the early din er, and all of&#xD;
the family sat down to share it. Aunt Nannie&#xD;
and Aunt Lois stayed too, for sad as it was, they&#xD;
would not miss seeing "the children" off. Deacon&#xD;
Winthrop's petition for blessing on the food, was&#xD;
lengthened into a dedication of his sor and daughter&#xD;
to any service in which their Heavenly Fath r&#xD;
might accept them, and that in all their goin s&#xD;

It required all of Grace's fortitude to keep 'back&#xD;
her tears, home seemed so inexpressibly dear, to&#xD;
her just then, but the cheerful voices of the chil-&#xD;
dren, and their wondering speculations as to what&#xD;
ihe would see, helped her to be glad that she was&#xD;
;oing. Nobody seemed very hungry, so there&#xD;
was not a long sitting over the early meal. f/&#xD;
And now came a bustle equal to the occa ion.&#xD;
Ihe baskets were carried out, and stowed away in&#xD;
:he box of the carriage. The trunk was strapped&#xD;
n behind, each boy giving the strap a pull to&#xD;
assure himself he had been useful in helping them&#xD;
)ff. Bundles were bestowed in corners, and lastly,&#xD;
clean bag, fill with oats, was laid on the bottom&#xD;
)f the gig, and covered with a blanket.&#xD;
"Yoi can use the bag for a footstool until the&#xD;
)ats are gone," said Deacon Winthrop, "and then&#xD;
f it rains, or is chilly, you will have the blanket to&#xD;
Iraw over you."&#xD;
Now came the adieus, and Grace and Ernest&#xD;
vere seated in the gig all ready to go. Deacon&#xD;
inthop must take one more survey of the horse&#xD;
ind harness, and repeated his admonition to "drive&#xD;
low, not to ride at evening, and be careful where&#xD;
hey stopped over-night."&#xD;
Mrs. Winthrop once more impressed on Grace&#xD;
he importance of thoughtfulness in everything,&#xD;
nd to be surely not to go out alone in Boston.&#xD;
\unt Nannie added, "Don't get a cold, but if you&#xD;
hould, be sure and ask your aunt to make you&#xD;
ome s bong herb tea, and drink it hot when you&#xD;

away they drove, followed by every lessing which&#xD;
such a household could bestow. The first ten&#xD;
miles were familiar, then came new hills, and new&#xD;
towns beyond them.&#xD;
"Can you believe, Ernest," said Grace,' as she&#xD;
rode along in quiet satisfaction; "that father and&#xD;
mother have really consented to let u go. I almost&#xD;
think we ran away."&#xD;
"They all saw us start, if we did" said Ernest.&#xD;
"So if they send out to find us, they will know&#xD;
which way to come. Grandfather and grandmoth-&#xD;
er looked very sober whgen I ran in there this morn-&#xD;
ing on my way from Mrs. Wheeler's  And Uncle&#xD;
Henry said he did n't see how mother ever gave&#xD;
her consent to our going off like this."&#xD;
"When. I went to tell them good -bye," said&#xD;
Grace, "grandmother said she hoped nothing&#xD;
would happen to us, but it was a great ways for'&#xD;
such children to go alone. I told he I was nearly&#xD;
seventeen,. and you are almost nineteen, and I asked&#xD;
her if, she did not think we could ehave pretty&#xD;
well when we tried. She smiled a ittle, and said&#xD;
we were good children, but she wi hed we were&#xD;
coming home instead of going away, though she&#xD;
knew the Lord would take care of u wherever we&#xD;
were. Aunt Nannie and Aunt Lois have looked as&#xD;
solemn ever since I told them, as if we were going&#xD;
to England, and.never coming.back., I don't think&#xD;
they have quite forgiven mother for letting us go.&#xD;
I thought we should have the most trouble with&#xD;

Ernest laughed at Grace's sudden appreciation&#xD;

quite fast, and then allowing Fearnaught to&#xD;
alk up the long hills. The face o, the country&#xD;
as so like that to which they had been accustom-&#xD;

" [his 'irl looks just as her mother did the first&#xD;

rdial grasp. " I was visiting down to your&#xD;

first Sunday I was there, Henry nudged my elbow&#xD;
and told me to look at that girl! I should think&#xD;
that was the very one."&#xD;
" People say I look like father's mother," said&#xD;
Grace, not knowing what else to say.&#xD;
"Is your name Annie ?"&#xD;
"No, sir ; my sister has mother's name. I am&#xD;
named Grace, after father's mother."&#xD;
"A good name, and a worthy person who had&#xD;
it. But come, mother," said he, addressing Mrs.&#xD;
Wilbur, "you see that they have a good supper&#xD;
while I look after the horse."&#xD;
By the time the ;horse was well disposed of, the&#xD;
supper-table was spread with its tempting old-&#xD;
fashioned cheer, not forgetting a delicious pump-&#xD;
kin-pie which Mrs. Wilbur had baked that very&#xD;
afternoon, the first of the season. Their early din-&#xD;
ner and long ride made our travelers hungry&#xD;
guests, but they were obliged to declare them-&#xD;
selves more than satisfied long before the variety&#xD;
gave out. Then they were takes into the "spare&#xD;
room," where Mr. Wilbur had kindled a little fire,&#xD;
"just to take off the chill," he said.&#xD;
Grace wondered where he found "the chill,"&#xD;
for the day had been warm, and her unusual ex-&#xD;
citement made it seem like midsummer; but the&#xD;
blaze was cheerful, and she was disposed to enjoy&#xD;
everything.&#xD;
"I must begin to ask you questions t9-night,"&#xD;
said -Mr. Wilbur,." or I shall not get through in&#xD;
the whole of your visit."&#xD;
"We shall have. to talk fast," said Ernest; 'for&#xD;

So the evening passed in pleasant converse, until.&#xD;
it was time to say good-night&#xD;
The morning dawned fair and beautiful. Ernest&#xD;
was up early to look after Fearnaught, but Mr.&#xD;
Wilbur was before him, and Fearnaught had only&#xD;
time to stop a moment over his ample measure of&#xD;
oats to whinney his good-morning tQ his master.&#xD;
A bountiful breakfast was waiting for them, and&#xD;
Mrs. Wilbur had put them up such a lunch that&#xD;
it was. hard to refuse ; but, as Grace told 'her,&#xD;
"Mother had filled every spare corner."&#xD;
"You shall, at least, take this pumpkin-pie," said&#xD;
she.    .&#xD;
Grace saw Ernest give it a wistful look, so she&#xD;
determined to find room for it somewhere, which&#xD;
she. accordingly did, quite to Mrs. Wilbur's satis-&#xD;
faction ; and again, to use Aunt Nannie's peculiar&#xD;
phrase, they "set away" on their all day ride,&#xD;
carrying many cordial wishes for a successful jour-&#xD;
ney, and giving, in return, a promise to call for a&#xD;

a good deal on themselves now--a-days.' When&#xD;
she was young, things were very different. I sup-&#xD;
pose we have been on her mind most of the time&#xD;
since yesterday noon ; but where is the cup, I&#xD;
must have a drink  of water."&#xD;
" Not out of this brook !" said Grace. "Fear-&#xD;
naught may drink, and I'll wash my hands in it,&#xD;
but we must wait until we come to a well."&#xD;
" I do not believe a dinner is often more thor-&#xD;
oughly enjoyed than this of our young friends&#xD;
under the maple-trees, with now and then a golden-&#xD;
tinted leaf dropping at their feet, or a wandering&#xD;
squirrel pausing to see who could have invaded&#xD;
his retreat. Behir d them lay home, father, mother,&#xD;
brothers and siste s, an unbroken band, no feelings&#xD;
of uncertainty as to what might happen while they&#xD;
were gone, sadd ned their bright anticipations.&#xD;
Before them was the long-talked-of visit, with its&#xD;
half-formed visions of something different from,&#xD;
and beyond anything they had ever seen. Few&#xD;
such rests will come again in their life-journey;&#xD;
but they do not know it now, and we will not dim&#xD;
-heir clear sunshine with the dark clouds of com-&#xD;
ing experience.&#xD;
Fearnaught ad enjoyed it too. Ernest took off&#xD;
his harness and let him have a good roll, and then,&#xD;
leading him to the brook, left him to drink at his&#xD;
leisure. " Nov', then, old fellow, you must do your&#xD;

days come; the sun had set, and still they were&#xD;
some miles from Uncle Josiah's.-.&#xD;
"I have inquired for the town so long," said Er-.&#xD;
nest, "that I almost .expect to see Uncle Josiah's&#xD;
house the first thing when we get to it. Who&#xD;
knows hoaw many miles we shall have to ride before&#xD;
we come to it?"&#xD;
At last the town was reached, and then came in-&#xD;
quiries for Mr. Josiah Munson. Every body seemed&#xD;
to know him, but that did not hinder his house&#xD;
from being at the extreme end of the town,&#xD;
stretching the twenty-five miles to nearly thirty,&#xD;
and causing Ernest some anxiety lest Fearnaught&#xD;
should be overtaxed.&#xD;
At last the moon shone on a long brown house&#xD;
which a passer-by said belonged to Mr. Josiah&#xD;
Munson. Here, then, our travelers were to stop ;&#xD;
so, fastening Fearnaught at the post, they went up&#xD;
the path and knocked .at the front door. No an-&#xD;
swer came. Only the moonbeams touching up the&#xD;
sombre-looking dwelling gave any light to objects&#xD;
within or without.&#xD;
"hKock again," said Grace, after waiting for&#xD;
some minutes; and knock, knock, went Ernest's&#xD;
knuckles, as if he meant somebody should hear.&#xD;
" Oh, dear !" said Grace, "it looks lonesome here.&#xD;
I believe I am homesick."&#xD;
Ernest smiled ; for his brave-hearted sister had&#xD;
never faltered a moment before since he first told&#xD;
her his wish to make the journey. " Har {.soma-&#xD;
body's coming."&#xD;
Just then an inner door opened, and there was a&#xD;
pause, as if a listener ,waited. to hear a sound.&#xD;

Grace ; "and I'm afraid of his cross dog, too.&#xD;

e dog havingdischarged his duty, quite to-his&#xD;
action, ran ahead and led the vWay to the kit-&#xD;
entrance of the house. The door was wide&#xD;
and an old. man with white-hair, and leaning&#xD;
staff, stood in it. The moonbeams had come&#xD;
I too and covered the old man with their soft,&#xD;
light. He looked weird and story-like to&#xD;

with a bewildered look at his young guests.&#xD;
"'Where did you come from ? Is Henry with you ?&#xD;
Come in, come in. Mother, bring a light. Do&#xD;
you hear what he says? They are Henry Win-&#xD;
throp's children !"&#xD;
Mrs. Munson was not far away. Her surprise was&#xD;
quite equal to,.her husband's... With  candle in one&#xD;
hand, and the other extended in cordial welcome,&#xD;
she advanced to meet them. "Why, children !&#xD;
how did you come ?" said she. "How did you&#xD;
ever find the way out here? When did you come&#xD;
from home ?"&#xD;
"Our horse and gig are at the gate," said Ernest,&#xD;
"and we left home day before yesterday."&#xD;
"Come right in ahd sit down by the fire," said&#xD;
Mr. Munson; "the nights are coolish this time of&#xD;
the year," and the old gentleman bustled round&#xD;
with uncommon activity, and placed two high-&#xD;
backed chairs in front of the fire. "I'm sorry&#xD;
enough that Jared isn't to home. Joseph," said he,&#xD;
addressing a young boy who had come in from out&#xD;
doors, "you can sho y this young man where to&#xD;
put his horse, and feed it for him. Put the carriage&#xD;
on the barn-floor."&#xD;
"Yes, sir," said Joseph, glad enough to have&#xD;
something to do with the new-comers.&#xD;
While Ernest had gone out, Mrs. Munson took&#xD;
Grace into the spare-room to take off her bonnet&#xD;
and shawl, and then seeing her comfortably seated&#xD;
in one of the high-backed chairs, proceeded to get&#xD;
supper. Mr. Munson went to the door every few&#xD;
minutes, as if his anxiety.must make up for his ina-&#xD;
bility to .go out and attend to feeding the horse&#xD;

hen the tea-things were removed, Mrs. Mun-&#xD;
drew up the. little round stand, and placing&#xD;
tallo  candles upon it, took out her knitting-&#xD;
, while Uncle Josiah seated himself in his&#xD;
chair, in the corner, Where he could poke the&#xD;

" What made you think of coming to see us ?"&#xD;
said the good old lady; "yohng folks don't usually&#xD;
care about looking up old ones."&#xD;
Then Ernest told his story of going to visit his&#xD;
Uncle Edward.&#xD;
" That's right !" said Mr. Munson; "but you ex-&#xD;
pect to stay and make us a little visit too, don't you ?"&#xD;
"Not now. When we come back, we hope to&#xD;
stop another night, and tell you about our visit."&#xD;
"When we went to Beechford the last time,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Munson, musingly, "I left a hou se full&#xD;
of children-pretty much as your mother would&#xD;
now-and they have all gone. How time does&#xD;
change every thing !"&#xD;
"Well, mother ! the clock says it is time for&#xD;
these young folks to go to bed. If they must go&#xD;
in the morning,. we must help them off."&#xD;
"I'm so sorry about Jared's being away, but&#xD;
they can't wait for him." Then the old man knelt&#xD;
by his armed-chair, and thanked God for b inging&#xD;
these ,young friends from his early home tp glad-&#xD;
den his way with good tidings of those he loved to&#xD;
remember. He prayed that they might be kept in-&#xD;
safety by the way, and 'return with rejoicing to&#xD;
their home. Rising from his knees, he extended a&#xD;
hand to each of them, bidding them sleep soundly,&#xD;
for they would need to be wide awake early to-&#xD;
morrow.&#xD;
"Another beautiful morning," said Grace, as&#xD;
she pushed away the curtain and looked out to-&#xD;
wards the rising sun. "I wish I could see  other&#xD;

was ready to speed their going. He went out&#xD;

Josiah; he knew they would want it befor&#xD;

always got hungry before they expected tc&#xD;
anxiety decided the matter, and then, with&#xD;
charges to take "this. road," and "that right&#xD;
corner," they were permitted to depart.&#xD;
"How glad they were to see us," said&#xD;
"If our great-uncle received us so kindly&#xD;
sure Uncle tdward will."&#xD;
"If we only had another uncle or cousin&#xD;
about fifty miles from here," said Ernest&#xD;
might call our journey quite a triumphal&#xD;
I begin to feel a little important, living ov&#xD;
events of father's and grandfather's times. I.&#xD;
not wonder if we get to be somebodymor&#xD;
'children' when we get home."&#xD;
"Wait until to-night," said Grace. "O&#xD;
portance will all disappear when out of the&#xD;
of father and mother's freinds, we get into&#xD;

"I rather expect to enjoy it. In the me&#xD;

in slow, indirect and tedious, dear friends were&#xD;
ig oran of each other's welfare for months, and&#xD;
so etimes for years. It required more relaxation&#xD;
fr m care than usually tell to the heads of families&#xD;
in Newx England, to accomplish a visit. To-day,&#xD;
when we have every facility to keep upwith our&#xD;
ab ent friends, we can hardly appreciate the im-&#xD;
p0 tance which attached itself fifty years ago to&#xD;
the arrival of a guest who brought tidings of ab-&#xD;
se t .loved ones. It was equal to volumes of let-&#xD;
te s, and files of newspapers; it freshened and&#xD;
str ngthened old ties, and filled up a vacancy which&#xD;
we never know. We must not stop to moralize, or&#xD;
we may lose sight of Fearnaught, who trots off at&#xD;
go d speed as if his night's rest had made him&#xD;
equal tc the toils of the day. They were many&#xD;
mi es from Uncle Josiah's when the silver watch&#xD;
told the hour of twelve, and their prompt dinner&#xD;
a wvered to the summons. The other chicken&#xD;
t sted a§ good as its fellow of-'yesterday. Aunt&#xD;
M artha's pie was an addition to its relish, and Un-&#xD;
cle Josiah's oats were an unexpected, gift to Fear-&#xD;
naught. Ernest hactintended to fill _up the bag at&#xD;
some farmer's by the way.&#xD;
They rested again, as on the day before, and&#xD;
then rode on until the afternoon shadows reminded&#xD;
them that no more uncles or cousins were waiting&#xD;
to welcome them, and they must begin to look out&#xD;
for the 'tavern " about which Edward 'Nelson's&#xD;
uncle hadl told- them. Fearnaught tried to make&#xD;
the most of the waning daylight, but evidently he&#xD;
was tire:1 ancd after going on. without. seeing any&#xD;
house which looked 4s if it were waiting for tray-&#xD;

elers, Ernest asked a man whom they met&#xD;
it was to the a"tavern."&#xD;
"'Bout four miles from here."&#xD;
"None nearer than that?" .&#xD;
" Wall, yes, come to think,-no, not a tav&#xD;
actly neither ; but Mr. Lester sometimes&#xD;
travelers when they git belated."&#xD;
"Where does he live ?"&#xD;
"'Bout a mile from here straight ahead.&#xD;
from far ?" as if some knowledge of their&#xD;
ings would be a proper compensation for&#xD;
formation hehad given them. .       41&#xD;
"Some ways back," said Ernest, with a&#xD;
".thank you " for the intelligence that Mr.&#xD;
sometimes kept travelers when they were b&#xD;
A few inquiries enabled them to stop bef&#xD;
door. It was scarcely dark, but the house&#xD;
lighted up that Grace concluded either&#xD;
many travelers had been belated, or someth&#xD;
usual was going on.&#xD;
Ernest went to make inquiries, while hi&#xD;
sat anxiously waiting the result. Of course&#xD;
must stop somewhere, and it might as well&#xD;
house as the tavern; but it was her first rea&#xD;
ing with utter strangers, and she shrank fro&#xD;
stinctively. She could not hear the conve&#xD;
between her brother and the person who&#xD;
the door ; evidently the person disappear&#xD;
Ernest w s waiting for an answer. Pres&#xD;
lady came and after speaking a few momen&#xD;
her, Ernest turned and caine to her.&#xD;
"This i Mr. Lester's, and they do son&#xD;

Still they say if we can put up with such accom-&#xD;
modations as they can give us, we may come in.&#xD;
What do you say ?"&#xD;
"I'm sure I do not know."&#xD;
Fearnaught decided the case by a beseeching&#xD;
whinny. He seemed to think he ought to be con-&#xD;
sulted and his decision would be, "No more ex-&#xD;
plorin to-night."&#xD;
"T hat expresses your feelings, old fellow," said&#xD;
Ernest, giving him  kindly pat. "You are. tired,&#xD;
and have gone far .nough for one day. We will&#xD;
take your advice. Come, Grace ; Fearnaught was&#xD;
brought up at Beechford, and he knows what it is&#xD;
best to do in this case," and helping his sister out&#xD;
from the gig, he went with her into the house.&#xD;
Mrs. Lester had disappeared, and a young lady,&#xD;
evidently her daughter, came to meet them, and&#xD;
took them into a little side-room, already well&#xD;
filled with hoods and shawls.&#xD;
"We have a good many friends with us this&#xD;
evening," said the young lady. "My brother is&#xD;
twenty-o e years old to-day, and father wanted to&#xD;
notice it in some vay. A few of our friends will&#xD;
stay all night, so w  shall have to give you a very&#xD;
small room."&#xD;
"That is much better than riding in a strange&#xD;
place so far in the dark," said Grace. " Can I be&#xD;

"Close by. Will you go up and take off your&#xD;
things."          '&#xD;

So she ventured to find her way to him in t&#xD;
room, where the hoods and shawls were.&#xD;
Lester had just been in to apologise for p&#xD;
them in that room, but it was least occupied&#xD;
this evening, and could they wait a little w&#xD;
tea.&#xD;
" We do not care for tea," said Grace.&#xD;
not hungry."&#xD;
Mrs. Winthrop's basket of cake could be&#xD;
ness to this; it was only shelter and rest&#xD;
night which they needed.&#xD;
"Now," said Grace, when they were&#xD;
"this seem to me very much like a dream,&#xD;
did we come from home ?"&#xD;
"This is only Wednesday night, and&#xD;
home Monday," said, Ernest.&#xD;
"It seems to me a month, at least," said&#xD;
"I wish it was morning now, and we we&#xD;
going instead of just coming."&#xD;
" I don't know as I care to stay hut up&#xD;

lined with pink,I tink I should like a little chat&#xD;
with its owner," an Ernest pointed to an unusu-&#xD;
ally coquettish little head-covering which lay amid&#xD;
a heap of grave one.&#xD;
" For my part, I like the hoods best. I would&#xD;
not go in the othe room for anything," said his&#xD;
sister.&#xD;
Grace had hardI finished her sentence before&#xD;
the young lady who had met them at the door ap-&#xD;
peared, to say tha her mother would be very&#xD;
happy to have Mr. nd Miss Winthrop come into&#xD;
the other room and spend the evening.&#xD;
Miss Winthrop w s on the oint of declining the&#xD;
invitation very decidedly, w len Ernest accepted&#xD;
it. He was out on an expedition, and had left all&#xD;
the cares which made him "as old as father" at&#xD;
home with that'same father, and the novelty of&#xD;
going with entire strangers rather pleased him.&#xD;
Without appearing to notice his sister's reluctance,&#xD;
he drew her hand i his arm, and followed Miss&#xD;
Lester into the other room. Mrs. Lester came to&#xD;
meet them, and conducted them to a seat, then,&#xD;
with motherly pride she brought along her son,&#xD;
who was the hero o the evening, and introduced&#xD;
him.&#xD;
Their entrance was rather an interruption to the&#xD;
games which were going briskly on. "Who are&#xD;
they ?" "Where did they come from ?" went in&#xD;
sly wb ispers around the circle, until it was fairly&#xD;
understood that Mr. and Miss Winthrop were&#xD;
brother and sister, stopping over night on their&#xD;
way to Boston.&#xD;

wife could produce The doughnuts and cheese&#xD;
which Ernest had eaten before dark, seemed to be-&#xD;
long to a period lon passed away, so he was well&#xD;
prepared to do justice to the birth-night supper.&#xD;
Grace had very little appetite, so she amused her-&#xD;
self in a quiet observation of the mirthful company,&#xD;
participating only as ,far as absolute politeness de-&#xD;
manded.&#xD;
It was son e time fter their return to the "front-&#xD;
room," before Grac got an opportunity to tell her&#xD;
brother how tired she' was, and how necessary it&#xD;
was that they should get rested for their next day's&#xD;
ride. Out of compassion for her, he excused both&#xD;
her and himself to Mrs. Lester and her daughter,&#xD;
and bidding them good-night, escorted Grace to&#xD;
her little room close by his own. Many inquiries&#xD;
were made after them, and many regrets expressed&#xD;
at their early departure, but the festivity went on&#xD;
while they slept, and were refreshed for their next&#xD;
day's journey.&#xD;

"We can but it will be late, and&#xD;

Ernest made, or of the winding ways he drove; it&#xD;
is sufficient to say, that about twelve .o'clock Fear-&#xD;
naught was drawn .up in front of an imposing,&#xD;
three-story brick house, the like of which, neither&#xD;
Erne t nor his sister had ever seen.&#xD;
Gr ce followed. her brother up the broad stone&#xD;
steps, feeling strangely forlorn, and wishing, with&#xD;
all her heart, that she was standing at the old porch&#xD;
at home. The huge,. brass knocker shone like&#xD;
gold, even the lion's mouth- which held it looked&#xD;
formidable, but Ernest had, not come all this way&#xD;
to be daunted in the end, so he knocked bravely.&#xD;
The summons was answered by a shining black&#xD;
man, neatly dressed.. He held the door open with&#xD;
a look of perplexed curiosity.&#xD;
"Does Colonel Winthrop live here ?" said Ernest.&#xD;
"Yes, sar," said Ralph.&#xD;
"Is he at home ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sar."&#xD;
"I wish to see him."&#xD;
The door was opened wider, and with a wonder-&#xD;
ing look, as if he did not fully comprehend his vis-&#xD;
itors, Ralph showed them into the parlor.&#xD;
This was so different from the picture Grace had&#xD;
drawn,! She thought her cousin Laura would&#xD;
come to the door, and she should tell her who they&#xD;
were, and then her uncle and aunt would come&#xD;
right in, and they would be taken into the spare&#xD;
.room, a great deal handsomer than theirs at home,&#xD;
of course, but not in the least like this !&#xD;
"What name shall I tell master ?" asked Ralph&#xD;
. "I will tell him when he comes," id Ernest,&#xD;
hardly knowing what reply he gave.&#xD;

Ralph gave them another look, and went out,&#xD;
leaving them alone in these wonderful parlors.&#xD;
Colonel Edward Winthrop, the owner of this&#xD;
stately mansion, and indeed the whol block in which&#xD;
it stood, left his father's farm at Beechford, a youth&#xD;
of seventeen, to serve his country in its mighty&#xD;
struggles against oppression. Entering the army as&#xD;
a private, he had, by his coolness, courage and mark-&#xD;
ed ability to carry out plans, been raised to the rank&#xD;
of Colonel. He suffered with the army in its&#xD;
winter at Valley Forge, and shared in its victory&#xD;
at Yorktowp. When peace was declared, and the&#xD;
army disbanded, Colonel Winthrop Ihad acquired a&#xD;
spirit of independent-adventure which the quiet&#xD;
of his native hills would never sati fy. Through&#xD;
some army acquaintances, he sought and obtained&#xD;
an advantageous mercantile situation in an import-&#xD;
ing house in Boston. Here his corr ctness of de-&#xD;
portment, his unbending integrity, and his finan-&#xD;
cial ability so thoroughly won the  onfidence of&#xD;
his employers, that. in time they received him as&#xD;
sharer, and t last into equal partnership with them-&#xD;
selves in the firm. Wealth had come into his pos-&#xD;
session with astonishing rapidity, and now at sixty-&#xD;
two he is tall, erect, and very dignifie in his bear-&#xD;
ing, with ceremonious habits, and fixed ways.&#xD;
The dinner hour must not vary, the carriage must&#xD;
be at the door for his daily drive at a near eleven&#xD;
o'clock as possible. His wife he always expected to&#xD;
accompany him at this hour, and his daughter, too,&#xD;
unless she chose to do something els. It was so&#xD;
manifestly his pleasure, that she counted it among&#xD;
1.er daily duties. He always rode on horseback&#xD;

K&#xD;

&#xD;
before breakfast, but was sure to be back in time,&#xD;
not to keep it waiting a moment;. His friends&#xD;
called him cold, and unapproachable, still they en-&#xD;
joyed .his genial moods. His hospitality was un-&#xD;
bounded, his kindness reaching into many a poor&#xD;
dwelling, where the donor was unknown.&#xD;
Mrs. Winthrop was some ten years his junior.&#xD;
She was born, and had lived in England, until her&#xD;
eighteenth year, so that her tastes and habits par-&#xD;
took strongly of her early education. Loving Col-&#xD;
onel Winthrop devotedly she accepted his country,&#xD;
and sympathized with him as, far as she could, but&#xD;
their early training had been so different, that she&#xD;
could never understand that part of his life which&#xD;
had stamped the man so indelibly.&#xD;
She had never visited the old homestead and&#xD;
knew little of his brothers or the scenes of hisboy-&#xD;
hood. He could not tell why he never spoke to&#xD;
her of them; only such was his nature that he-*kept&#xD;
them as hidden treasures. -He had met and won&#xD;
her in scenes so widely apart from them that they&#xD;
never blended in his mind. His father and mother&#xD;
died before his marriage ; and without the bonds&#xD;
of letters and occasional visits, he seemed, almost a&#xD;
stranger to his e rly home. Of late his thoughts&#xD;
had often gone ba k to the dear old starting-place,&#xD;
and sometimes there would come a longing to&#xD;
drink from the clear water of the well, or sit in the&#xD;
old oaken chair on the porch. At times he could&#xD;
almost hear the murmur of the little stream which&#xD;
ran through (the middle of the farm, where he had&#xD;
so often stopped to let the cows drink when he was&#xD;
driving them home at night. Then he would think&#xD;

of the dinner in the old' kitchen pi&#xD;
mother's hands, and which'. even no&#xD;

twenty years older, looked filling his&#xD;
and the children ! how many were t&#xD;
did they compare with his father's chi&#xD;
Sometimes during the last summer&#xD;
brances had been so vivid that he&#xD;
Mrs. Winthrop about going to Bee&#xD;
his brother and the old place. If it p&#xD;
go, she expected he would, without&#xD;
agement on er part. She'only said,&#xD;

Laura was nineteen; she had inher&#xD;

her complexion clear and dark. She.&#xD;
all the advantages of education which&#xD;
supply ; and having left school and ent&#xD;
she was receiving the usual amount&#xD;

and now if&#xD;
t them and&#xD;
&#xD;
follow their wondering eyes, we shall see that the&#xD;
rooms are very spacious and connected by folding-&#xD;
doors, that the ceilings are high, the 'carpets so&#xD;
unlike that model of stripes in the spare roo n at&#xD;
home that it can hardly bear the ,same name. No&#xD;
bom in America had ever produced such a mavel&#xD;
cf beauty ; it was a study in itself to their n-&#xD;
sophisticated eyes. Then the mirrors! it would&#xD;
surely tak e three or four of those at home to make&#xD;
one of these; and the tables were so beautifully&#xD;
carved, and the chairs were so handsome!&#xD;
"Ernest," whispered Grace, "what is that long&#xD;
narrow table on the other side of the room, with&#xD;
so many twisted legs, it .looks as if it opened with&#xD;
a lid."&#xD;
"I don't know," said Ernest. "I'm getting pretty&#xD;
near the end of my knowledge, and if Uncle Ed-&#xD;
ward does not come before long, I shall find my&#xD;
way back to Beechford. I had rather cut hay all&#xD;
day than sit here perched up in this strange place."&#xD;
"It is so different from anything I expected,"&#xD;
said Grace, "it seems alniost like fairy land. Hark!&#xD;
I hear somebody coming!" Just then the door&#xD;
opened, and the stately man advanced to see who&#xD;
waited for him.&#xD;
With a native dignity, as rhuch a part of himself&#xD;
as it was of his uncle, Ernest rose to ,meet him.&#xD;
"It is Colonel Winthrop, I 'believe?" said he.&#xD;
"Yes ;" and a pair of kecn eyes rested on the&#xD;
young man's face with sudd n intensity.&#xD;
"I am Ernest Winthrop, your brother Henry's&#xD;

"Laura," said he, goingto the door and speaking&#xD;
to some one who had just come in, "I want you&#xD;
here."&#xD;
Laura came; the expression on her father's face&#xD;
was unusual. She saw the strangers sitting near&#xD;
the window ; she hardly comprehended when he&#xD;
led her towards them and said, "Your cousins,&#xD;
Grace and Ernest Winthrop, from Beechford."&#xD;
She had heard of her Incle Henry, but of his&#xD;
children she knew nothin . Sometimes in her&#xD;
yearnings for brother or sister, she had wondered&#xD;
if she had no cousins who could in any degree fil&#xD;
the place, but she seldom sp ke to her father about&#xD;
such things. One glance revealed that her cousin's&#xD;
dress was provincial; but that sweet face! and&#xD;
that irresistible charm of a refined nature which&#xD;
spoke in the simple act of salutation,,opened Lau-&#xD;
ra's heart at once. She felt that there had come&#xD;
to her the very love she had so long desired. Er-&#xD;
nest pleased her too; he did not seem out of. place&#xD;
in his new surroundings. There was such a quiet&#xD;
independent manner in his, greeting, that she felt&#xD;
an involuntary respect for him.&#xD;
"Come, daughter," said Colonel Winthrop, "take&#xD;
your cousin up to your mother's roam."&#xD;
"I suppose I must look after my' horse, Uncle,"&#xD;
said Ernest, going to the window.&#xD;
"Give yourself no trouble about him. I will see&#xD;

but, as he took&#xD;
esolved that it&#xD;
&#xD;
should not spoil his visit or hinder him from getting&#xD;
all the ideas he could while he staid in Boston.&#xD;
He gave his glossy, chestnut hair an extra brush.&#xD;
His well-shaped mputh and fine, dark eyes express-&#xD;
ed more power than, wanting these, all the tailors&#xD;
in the land could have given him.&#xD;
Mrs. Winthrop met her niece with kindness.&#xD;
She was never demonstrative. She was glad she&#xD;
was so pretty, and if her husband and daughter&#xD;
were pleased at her coming, she was glad she had&#xD;
come.&#xD;
She came down to the parlor just before dinner&#xD;
to be introduced to Ernest. She was very cor-&#xD;
dial, and.even fancied he bore some. resemblance&#xD;
to his uncle.&#xD;
The announcement of dinner came very soon,&#xD;
and our travelers who, for the last three days, had&#xD;
dined by the road-side, found themselves seated at&#xD;
an elegant table in a richly-furnished dining-room..&#xD;
The goblets were of silver, the dishes all perfectly&#xD;
matched, and Ralph, the shining black man, who&#xD;
met them at the door, took his place behind his&#xD;
master's chair. Grace instinctively felt that here&#xD;
was a new place, and that awkwardness or mistake&#xD;
would annoy her uncle especially. It was a mutual&#xD;
mystery to. herself and Ernest how they ever got&#xD;
through with 'that, ceremonious dinner. They&#xD;
thought of home, and the table set with blue-and-&#xD;
white dishes, and di-shes that were, not white-and-&#xD;
blue. Several variet es they could have mention-&#xD;
ed-it was not the dishes, it was the freedom they&#xD;
.were thinking of, and they wished Ralph would&#xD;
have some errand that would take him out. of the&#xD;

room entirely. It seemed to them  ha4 they could'&#xD;
not eat while he stood there watching them.&#xD;
Then tney thought of their last thre dinners, how&#xD;
free and easy they had been with orly the squirrels&#xD;
to watch them. They felt greatly relieved when,&#xD;
at last, they rose from the 'table without having&#xD;
made any positive mistake. "Going to Boston"&#xD;
was a more wonderful undertaking than they had&#xD;
imagined.&#xD;
"I shall go to drive this afternoon, and take Ernest&#xD;
with me,"'said Colonel Winthrop.&#xD;
Grace went to her room to unpack her trunk,&#xD;
and to begin a letter to her mother.&#xD;
Laura went to her mother's room. "Is n't she&#xD;
lovely, mother ?"&#xD;
" Yes, she is ; but you must put a few touches to&#xD;
her dress. You can attend to tha better than I&#xD;
can. She might think I was finding fault."&#xD;
About an hour 'after, Laura tapped lightly at&#xD;
her cousin's door, and found her busily writing to,&#xD;
her mother.&#xD;
" I was going to ask you to let e come in and&#xD;
sit with you, but I shall interrupt you."&#xD;
" Never mind that. I did not intend to finish&#xD;
my letter until I had seen Ernest again. 'Do come&#xD;
in."&#xD;
It was astonishing how rapidly their acquaint-&#xD;
ance progressed. Laura was asking about "mother&#xD;
and Annie and father and the boys and little Mary,"&#xD;
and Grace felt as if talking about them to an inter-&#xD;
ested listener was next to seeing them.&#xD;
After awhile Laura unrolled a beautiful piece of&#xD;
ribbon which was lying in her work-basket. " Isn't&#xD;
&#xD;
FIFTY YEARS AGO.&#xD;
&#xD;
that pretty ?" said she, handing it to Grace. "I&#xD;
bought it this morning to trim my bonnet."&#xD;
Grace had. never seen anything so beautiful in&#xD;
the way of ribbons, so she expressed her admira-&#xD;
tion of it.&#xD;
" I am going to treat you just as if you were&#xD;
my sister," said Laura; "and as I never had one,&#xD;
maybe I shall- be tyrannical. But you must not&#xD;
rebel. You must not say a word if I put this rib-&#xD;
bon on your bonnet and get some' more for my-&#xD;
self." She took Grace's bonnet in her hand as she&#xD;
spoke, and laid the rich ribbon over it. "There !"&#xD;
said she. "Your straw is very white and neat-&#xD;
looking, but I know you cannot get such ribbon in&#xD;
Beechford."&#xD;
Grace did not tell her she went six miles on&#xD;
horseback to get a brand-new ribbon for this very&#xD;
visit, and paid more for it than for any she or&#xD;
Annie had ever owned before; how Aunt Lois&#xD;
had admired it, and thought there' could be none&#xD;
in Boston to vie with it. She only thanked. her&#xD;
cousin in her own sweet way, and begged her to&#xD;
do just as she pleased with her bonnet.&#xD;

CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
INCIDENTS OF THE VISIT.&#xD;
NATE sill leave Laura and Grace to their pleas-&#xD;
ant chat, and follow Colonel Winthrop and&#xD;
his nephew in their afternoon drive.. Colonel Win-&#xD;
throp had not been long in discovering that. his&#xD;
nephew's coat did not do him full justice. If there&#xD;
had been no way to remedy it, he would have&#xD;
thought it a very secondary' consideration ; but&#xD;
there was, and, with a feeling of relief that he&#xD;
could express his joy at seeing him in some tangible&#xD;
way, he ordered John to drive to his tailor's.&#xD;
Leaving Ernest in the carriage, he went in to in-&#xD;
quire how soon it was possible to make a new suit&#xD;
for a' young gentleman.&#xD;
"We will attend to it immediately," said the&#xD;
proprietor. "Wait a moment, sir, if you please,",&#xD;
said he, as if a sudden thought had struck him.&#xD;
"We have just made a suit for a young gentle-&#xD;
man, a very handsome one. Unfortunately there&#xD;
was a mistake in the size, and he has brought them&#xD;
'back. They are a size too large, anyway. Per.-&#xD;
haps, as you are in a hurry, you would like to look&#xD;
at them."&#xD;
Colonel Winthrop examined she garments which&#xD;
&#xD;
the tailor produced,' and pronounced them just&#xD;
what he wanted, provided they would fit. Telling&#xD;
the man he would return soon, he went ont to&#xD;
Ernest. Speaking so that John need not hear,.he&#xD;
said, " I want you to go in here with me, and ac-&#xD;
cept what I do, just the same as if you were with&#xD;
your father. If he thought you ought to have a&#xD;
new coat, you would not refuse it. if I can afford&#xD;
to buy it better than he can, then it is my right to,&#xD;
I think, so you must come in with. me here for a&#xD;
few minutes and do just as I think best."&#xD;
It was Ernest's turn to be amazed now. He be-&#xD;
gan to say something, but his uncle stopped him&#xD;
by saying, "No time for words now,; this is ac-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
There was something so decided and prompt in&#xD;
his manner that .Ernest started as if he must 'be&#xD;
out of the car iage' and following him quickly.&#xD;
Once before they reached the door he managed&#xD;
to ejaculate " Uhcle !" but the rest of it was never&#xD;
heard, for he was hurried on and into the back&#xD;
room to try on lie-new suit.&#xD;
It was prono nced a perfect fit; and if he could&#xD;
have fully understood the light in his uncle's face,&#xD;
he would have k own that this outlet was reliev-&#xD;
ing the pent-up emotions of his heart. It was the&#xD;
first active expression he had given to the mem-&#xD;
ory of his home in Beechford for m py years,&#xD;
and he wondered if it could be true that such an&#xD;
opportunity ha really come to him to-day !&#xD;
He enjoyed 3rnest's looks of surprise, remon-&#xD;
strance, appreci tion and gratitude; and as they&#xD;
continued their ride, and he :attempted to thank&#xD;

him, he stopped him by saying, " I know you are&#xD;
pleased, and so am I; now we are on equal terms.&#xD;
Remember, I was once a little boy in the same&#xD;
house where you have grown up--that the same&#xD;
parents loved your father and myself; and now,&#xD;
when it is so many years since I have heard from&#xD;
that home, I want you. to understand how glad I&#xD;
am that you came to tell me about it."&#xD;
By this time they had reached home.&#xD;
You can, at least, dress for tea," said his uncle,&#xD;
smiling.&#xD;
Fortunately Ernes met no one as he carried his&#xD;
bundle to his own room.&#xD;
Grace,. at Laura'ssuggestion, had arrayed her-&#xD;
self in Annie's silk. It seemed to her like trespass-&#xD;
ing, for Annie never wore it except on very pleas-&#xD;
ant Sundays, or on some great occasion. She&#xD;
smoothed its folds very tenderly, and assured her-&#xD;
self that she would treat it with great care ; but,&#xD;
of course, she must wear it if Laura wanted&#xD;
her to.&#xD;
"I like the way you arrange your hair," said&#xD;
Laura. , Now, you must wear this collar and rib-&#xD;
bon, and here is a ribbon for your hair to match the&#xD;
one for your neck."&#xD;
It seemed to Grace a ldng time since she h q&#xD;
seen Ernest, and as Laura was not quite ready, s e"&#xD;
thought she would go down to the parlor, hopir&#xD;
to find him alone. She drew back as she was en-&#xD;
tering, for a strange gentleman was there, standing&#xD;
with his back to her.as he looked out of the win-&#xD;
dow. She turned to go away, supposing herself to&#xD;
be unseen. The gentleman turned around and&#xD;
&#xD;

said, in.a voices&#xD;

&#xD;
.Tea was less elaborate than dinner had been.&#xD;
Grace did not pay so much attention to the beau-&#xD;
tiful silver service as she'would have done if her&#xD;
eyes had not wandered continually over to the fine-&#xD;
ly dressed gentleman who sat opposite her. There&#xD;
was a merry twinkle in her eye which could scarce&#xD;
be held in check by her strange surroundings. The&#xD;
evening brought some friends of Colonel and Mrs.&#xD;
Winthrop to call. Colonel Winthrop introduced&#xD;
his nephew and neice with evident pleasure, and&#xD;
they quietly enjoyed their new surroundings.&#xD;
"Come, daughter," said Colonel Winthrop, "give&#xD;
us some music. Your cousins would like to hear&#xD;
some, too, I suspect."&#xD;
The gentleman with whoin Laura was convers-&#xD;
ing rose immediately, and went with her across the&#xD;
room to the "long table with twisted legs," which.&#xD;
had attracted Grace's attention when they sat&#xD;
waiting for their.uncle. He raised the lid, and&#xD;
Laura drew out a curious chair from under "the&#xD;
table,"placed some music in front of-her, and with&#xD;
her fingers on the-ivory keys, made such a delight-&#xD;
ful combination of sweet sounds,'that her cousins&#xD;
were silently enraptured. They exchanged most&#xD;
expressive glances; no other manifestat on showed&#xD;
that they had never heard or 'seen a piano before.&#xD;
When Grace laid her head on her pillow that&#xD;
night, she tried to realize all that had befallen her&#xD;
since she left home, but it seemed weeks and weeks&#xD;
ago. Even this first day in Boston had been long-&#xD;
er than three ordinary ones. She felt a ittle afraid&#xD;
of her uncle and aunt, and yet she liked them both.&#xD;
She was delighted with Laura. She wondered&#xD;
&#xD;
FIFTY'YEARS AGO.            83&#xD;
how Ernest lik d them. She had so much to say&#xD;
to him, but she did not see as there would be much&#xD;
opportunity urtil they were on their way home.&#xD;
She woke the next morning to wonder where she&#xD;
was-a wonde{ which her waking senses quickly&#xD;
dissipated. Laura came for her soon after she was&#xD;
dressed, and they went down-stairs together. Col-&#xD;
onel Winthrop had returned from his morning&#xD;
ride, and Ernest from a short walk. Mrs. Win-&#xD;
throp soon joi ed them, and .then breakfast wa&#xD;
ready. Ernest spent the morning with his uncle,&#xD;
who took him to places of interest in the city&#xD;
Grace went wi h her cousin on a shopping expedi&#xD;
tion. All he   life long .she had , only known&#xD;
the buying w ich necessity prompts. it seemed&#xD;
strange to see aura selecting from so. many beau.&#xD;
tiful things just what her taste dictated; such&#xD;
marvels of silk and ribbons almost confused her.&#xD;
She had never even thought of such stores where&#xD;
ladies chose shades and fabrics as their fancy dic-&#xD;
tated. Occasionally she expressed h r admiration,&#xD;
but her wonde ing thoughts were no often suffer&#xD;
ed to escape. As Laura afterwards told her moth&#xD;
er, "She took o pretty things so naturally."&#xD;
The dinner id not seem quite so tedious to her&#xD;
the second da . She enjoyed the long, delightful&#xD;
drive afterwards, and listened with great interes&#xD;
as her uncle jointed out paces of revolutionary&#xD;
interest. The  the grand harbor, with its white&#xD;
sails and many islands stretched away in the dig.&#xD;
tance, gave a  ondrous variety to the views from&#xD;
the hills. Colonel Winthrop was in his element&#xD;
pointing out his favorite views to .his appreciating&#xD;

The Sabbat- daypassed on. Ernest and. Grace&#xD;
remembered the gathering in the "spare-room "&#xD;
at home ; they knew that they were missed and&#xD;
remembered there.   With Monday came new&#xD;
'plans for riding and sightseeing: Colonel Win-&#xD;
throp, with his usual precision, had arranged t&#xD;
have their whole visit comprise as much of Bosto&#xD;
-and its belongings as would be possible to get mto&#xD;
the time allotted for it. At first he objected to it&#xD;
shortness, but at last compromised the matter by&#xD;
insisting on Ernest's writing to his father that, in-&#xD;
stead of leaving on Thursday as they intended,&#xD;
they should wait until the following Monday. The&#xD;
only real objection was the gig, and that they&#xD;
thought Mrs. Wheeler would excuse when they&#xD;
explained it to her. Ernest's school did not com-&#xD;
mence until the first of November, so he had the&#xD;
time on that account. Colonel Winthrop pro-&#xD;
posed. that Ernest should join him in his morning&#xD;
rides on horseback. Fearnaught always had the&#xD;
appearance on these occasions of being occupied&#xD;
with some mysterious subject, which he vainly tried&#xD;
to solve. It was plainly evident that there was&#xD;
something wrong in his surroundings. He neighed&#xD;
at Ernest in a demanding sort of way, as if he alone&#xD;
could tell him what all this meant, and where "his&#xD;
barn and pasture lot could be found. Grace watch-&#xD;

ively that her uncle would not like t have her;&#xD;
he did not understand what a familiar, home-friend&#xD;
this favorite horse was. Laura and Grace were&#xD;
becoming excellent friends. Laura made so many&#xD;
improvements in her toilette, in such a delicate&#xD;
way, that she never felt hurt by seeming to be de-&#xD;
ficient in the many luxurious articles which were&#xD;
so,.indispensable to her cousin.&#xD;
It was Thursday evening, and they had been near-&#xD;
ly a week in Boston. Colonel Winthrop, with his&#xD;
hands folded behind him, was taking his customary&#xD;
walk back and forth throb gh the parlors. Mrs.&#xD;
Winthrop, leaning back in her easy-chair, silently&#xD;
contemplated the group at the piano. Ernest was&#xD;
finding a song which he wished Laura to sing.&#xD;
Laura was softly playing a prelude whilst 'she&#xD;
waited for the song. Grace's attitude was one of&#xD;
unconscious repose. She was thinking of how&#xD;
Annie would enjoy the music, and o how many&#xD;
things she would have to tell her when she got&#xD;
home.&#xD;
Thus communing with herself, her face reflected&#xD;
the quiet happiness within. "My mother!" said&#xD;
Colone Winthrop, to himself, "how she comes&#xD;
back to me in that face; I cannot spare it yet."&#xD;
"Grace!" said he, pausing in his w lk directly&#xD;
in front of her, " I think we must keep you&#xD;
here all winter, and let Ernest go back with-&#xD;
out you."&#xD;
"Father!" said Laura, turning suddenly around,&#xD;
"that is just what I have been thinkin  about to-&#xD;
day.'. I -should be delighted to have  er stay all&#xD;

winter. Do you hear it, mother? would n't you&#xD;
be glad too ?"&#xD;
"bCertainly, daughter. I think it is quite singu-&#xD;
lar that we should each have.thought of it without&#xD;
speaking to any one about it."&#xD;
Grace did not say a word; the proposition was&#xD;
so unexpected, and so impossible, that she only&#xD;
looked her astonishment at Ernest. Then there&#xD;
came such a vision of home, and the dear ones&#xD;
gathered there, that her heart nestled back asiif it&#xD;
would rest in it forever.&#xD;
" Oh, thank you, uncle !" said she, recalling her-&#xD;
self enough to know that they were all waiting for&#xD;
her answer. "I could not let Ernest go. back&#xD;
alone; besides, mother and 'Annie need me very&#xD;
much this winter."&#xD;
"Suppose 'I should write to them, and tell them&#xD;
how much we need you here? -I.think they would&#xD;
consent."&#xD;
"Oh, yes !" said Laura," we will all write ; I must&#xD;
have you for a sister.. I was thinking to-day, that&#xD;
it was you I had- been wanting for a long time.&#xD;
You will let her stay, cousin Ernest, won't you ?"&#xD;
"I hardly know what to say. I think mother&#xD;
would be very much disappointed to see me com-&#xD;
ing home without her."&#xD;
"I know she would," said Grace. "I have had&#xD;
a delightful visit, and shall want to come again very&#xD;
much; but I do not believe, uncle, I could let Er-&#xD;
nest go home without.me." Her tones were al-&#xD;
most tremulous, for the thought of that dear home&#xD;
fading out, of sight for the whole winter was full.of&#xD;
uridefined sarrow..&#xD;

" Let it go for to-night," said Color,&#xD;
Perhaps, when you think of it to-i&#xD;
will feel differently. But, remember,&#xD;

Grace thanked him just like herse&#xD;
cerity he could not fail to appreciate,&#xD;
decision might be.- " No, I cannot st&#xD;

every thing here very much; it is&#xD;

and I am sure she will not urge me."&#xD;
ting her troubles, she fell asleep, and&#xD;
home. When she awoke, her mind wa&#xD;
up to brave even her uncle's displeas&#xD;
between her and Beechford. She did&#xD;
nest alone all day, though she watche&#xD;

herself with great vivacity over the new things she&#xD;

"If you ha e seen so much in one week, think&#xD;
how much nore you could s e in a whole winter.&#xD;
You must remember such adyntages do not come&#xD;
to every body."&#xD;
" I know it ; and you are very kind, uncle, to ask&#xD;
me to stay and enjoy them, but I must go back&#xD;
with Ernest. I had to urge mother very hard to&#xD;
let me come for only a week, and I know she will not&#xD;
like it if I do not." This speech cost Grace a great&#xD;
effort, and she waited: to see how it was received.&#xD;
" Well then ! I have thought of a new plan.&#xD;
Suppose next September .I should go to Beech-&#xD;
ford, will you promise to get your father and moth.&#xD;
er's consent to come back with me ?"&#xD;
"Do you really mean you will come to Beech-&#xD;
ford, uncle?"&#xD;
"It is looking into an uncertainty. I do not&#xD;
know what may happen to prevent, but you and&#xD;
Ernest have made me feel so like a boy again, that&#xD;
I am very anxious to see the old place once more.&#xD;
I should like to have your aunt and cousin see the&#xD;
spot where I was once young like you."&#xD;
"I should be "delight d with that plan, father,"&#xD;
said Laura; "only I ha1 rather keep Grac now,&#xD;
and take her home fo : a visit then. It is a long&#xD;
time to wait-a whole year."&#xD;
" Oh! it will come quickly, Laura," said Gi ace,&#xD;
with one of her pleased smiles. "I should like that&#xD;
very much, uncle. Father and mother woukt be&#xD;
so glad to see you, and then they might think it&#xD;
best to. let me come back with you."&#xD;

"Will you come ?" said Laura, rathe sadly.&#xD;
"If they will let me. I should be very happy&#xD;
here, if I had come from home expec ing to stay&#xD;
away so long, and they were reallywilling to let me."&#xD;
Ernest rode up to, the carriage jut .then, and&#xD;
Grace 1 aned out to tell him of their u cle's propo-&#xD;
sition. He smiled his approval of th settlement&#xD;
so heartily, that his sister felt that he. as as much&#xD;
relieved by it as she was herself.&#xD;
Ernest rides splendidly," said Laur .&#xD;
'" Yes, yes," said her father, "we had a fine gallop&#xD;
this morning; it almost made a young man of me.&#xD;
Even your mother told me this morning that I had&#xD;
grown fifteen years younger in the last week."&#xD;
Mrs. Winthrop smiled quietly. She was accus-&#xD;
tomed to seeing her husband polite, but unap-&#xD;
proachable even to his most familiar fri nds, and it&#xD;
did seem to her strange that these two young peo-&#xD;
ple, with whom he had no particular association,&#xD;
should so move him. She had never thought of&#xD;
him as related to anybody but herself and Laura.&#xD;
She enjoyed the new phase in his character, and con-&#xD;
gratulated herself that his nephew and niece were&#xD;
presentable; "for," said she to Laura, "if they&#xD;
had been awkward and disagreeable, your father&#xD;
would have insisted on having his brother's chil-&#xD;
dren made conspicuous when they came so far to&#xD;
look him up."&#xD;
"But she is lovely, mother! Henry Marshall&#xD;
told me last night that she had one of t e sweetest&#xD;
faces he ever saw.&#xD;
"Your father says she has so. much character.&#xD;
He thinks there is something about h r so much&#xD;
&#xD;
like your grandmother. He says she could sur-&#xD;
mount almost any difficulty, and always made&#xD;
things look bright and cheerful about her. He&#xD;
has told me more about her since Grace came,&#xD;
than I ever heard him say before. Did you notice&#xD;
last night how he drew Gr4ce on to tell him how&#xD;
she and Ernest ever got their mother's consent .to&#xD;
making this journey. He told me afterwards that&#xD;
I could not understand the difficulties that lay in&#xD;
the way as he did. But he was convinced that&#xD;
Grace had his mother's way of accomplishing what&#xD;
she set about doing."&#xD;
" Well, I like her as much as father does. I&#xD;
think they have enough at Beechford without her,&#xD;
and 1 wish she would be content to stay with us."&#xD;
"There is not much use in wishing at present.&#xD;
We would not want a captive: and I am sure she&#xD;
would be one, if she staid now. Your father thinks&#xD;
he shall surely go to Beechfo 'd next year. Then&#xD;
she may like to come home wlth us."&#xD;
It was a great relief to Grace, when she found&#xD;
the idea of. going to Beechford was making things&#xD;
smooth. It grieved her, after receiving so much&#xD;
kindness,-to seem so unwilling to stay longer with&#xD;
her friends, and perhaps, by another year, her&#xD;
fath r and mother. might think ,it best, and she&#xD;
might want to come back very much.&#xD;

CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
"HOMEWARD BOUND."&#xD;
M      ONDAY morning came. Fearnaughi, look-&#xD;
ing fresh and sleek from the hand of his city&#xD;
groom, stood harnessed before Mrs. Wheeler's gig&#xD;
ready to carry our adventurers home. He pawed&#xD;
the stones with .an impatient hoof, as if some new&#xD;
idea had taken possession of him. .Home must be&#xD;
somewhere in the wide world, and he was deter-&#xD;
mined to find it. Grace's trunk was packed to&#xD;
overflowing. It was astonishing how much it&#xD;
could be made to hold. Besides, there was a&#xD;
carpet-bag filled with remembrances for those at&#xD;
home. Not one of them had been forgotten. The&#xD;
box of the gig was packed full. Aunt Nannie and&#xD;
Aunt Lois" had each a white neckerchief. Laura&#xD;
had been so-.interested in Grace's description of&#xD;
them that she wanted to send them something, and&#xD;
Grace had suggested these. Even Fearnaught's&#xD;
bag for oats was filled with packages which were&#xD;
never designed for him to eat up.&#xD;
At last, everything being ready, our travelers&#xD;
took leave of the friends who had welcomed them'&#xD;
so cordially, and done so much to make their visit&#xD;

Ernest gave a meaning rap on his pocket.&#xD;
",Uncle was equal to mother, only in another way.-&#xD;
He gave me money enough to .take us home.&#xD;
We can have a good dinner if we can find it."&#xD;
"How kind he was. At first it seemed strange ;&#xD;
but I kept thinking he was father's brother, and&#xD;
then I did not wonder so much.'"&#xD;
"Yes," said Ernest; "-if a stranger had taken&#xD;
me to a tailor's and dressed me up, I should have&#xD;
thanked him, and ut on my old clothes again. I&#xD;
did feel rather uncomfortable at first, as it was ;&#xD;
but I thought father would have been just as gen-&#xD;
erous if he had had Uncle Edward's purse ; and I&#xD;
know, by the way he did it, he meant it."&#xD;
Ernest left his incle's house in these same new&#xD;
clothes, but the second morning of their journey&#xD;
he folded them carefully up and attired himself-in&#xD;
the garments he had worn away from home.&#xD;
Their ride was marked by no especial incident.&#xD;
They spent one night at their Uncle Josiah's&#xD;
whose welcome-was like one who had known'them&#xD;
for years. The shortness of their stay was all that&#xD;
troubled him. H6 wished to hear all about "Ed-&#xD;
ward" and.Boston, and sent so many messages to&#xD;
Henry" and "Arinie," and " Nannie" and " Lois,"&#xD;
and "your grandfather and grandmother," that&#xD;
Grace was afraid she should forget them amid the&#xD;
multitude of things she should have to say.&#xD;
"Tell them that I shall go home before long,&#xD;
and I shall expect to see them coming, when their&#xD;
work on earth is done. And I want to see you&#xD;

"What did uncle say ?"&#xD;
"He told me he had no active connection with&#xD;
the firm in which he used, to do business, but he&#xD;
had influence, and he would remember me if a de-&#xD;
sirable vacancy should occur. In the meantime,&#xD;
he advised me to read and study all I can keep on&#xD;
teaching, and working with father for, at least, a&#xD;
year longer. He encouraged me very much by say-&#xD;
ing that young mien who are educated -i such a&#xD;
home as ours make the firm, reliable men of the&#xD;
country. He saic I would never be a loser by&#xD;
staying with father, at least, another year, unless a&#xD;
very desirable opportunity should offer."&#xD;
"Home would be very lonely withou you. I&#xD;
don't like to talk about it."&#xD;
" No, we will not. I do not mean to say any-&#xD;

"His carriage is very fine, and I like them all;&#xD;

the travelers, as if he were balancing which&#xD;
e greatest pleasure, to be the first to tell&#xD;
y had come, or the first to greet them.&#xD;

of bundles, and curious. eyes tried to look through&#xD;
mysterious wrappings.&#xD;
"Children !" said Mrs. Winthrop, in a tPne of au-&#xD;
thority, "don't you touch one of the bundles until&#xD;
Grace gets ready to open them. I shall send you&#xD;
away unless you are more quiet."&#xD;
Ernest's first care was to take the carriage back&#xD;
in the same good condition in which it went away.&#xD;
"Don't unpack your things until after supper,&#xD;
Grace," said Mrs. Winthrop, "the children are so&#xD;
excited now that they are beside themselves. Sup-&#xD;
per will be ready as soon as your father comes."&#xD;
Ernest had just returned .from Mrs. Wheeler's,&#xD;
when Deacon Winthrop drove in sight. Fear-&#xD;
naught and CosaP recognized each other in a mo-&#xD;
ment, and neighed- wonderful welcomes. Father&#xD;
and son clasped hands most warmly. Grace was&#xD;
not' far away, and quickly ran out to greet her&#xD;
father. ~&#xD;
By the time the family were once more together,&#xD;
the supper was ready. In daily expectation of&#xD;

f equal softness, but of brighter hues; there&#xD;
liars and ribbons, and two or three dresses&#xD;
a's, slightly worn,\which would make up&#xD;

Annie hastened to open it; for a moment -&#xD;
not recognize her guest, only the face be-&#xD;
to Ernest, and wondering she drew back&#xD;
ned the door wider. The gentleman bowed&#xD;
in very politely, and goiig directly up to&#xD;

up in amazement; for a moment silence fell&#xD;

imful of admiration, they shouted, ".Oh,&#xD;

"Come, children," said Mrs.: Winthrop, "that&#xD;
will do; you must be more quiet or I shall send&#xD;
you to bed." This was a quietus. Children have&#xD;
a natural aversion to going to bed, especially if&#xD;
anything unusual is going on. Arthur and Mary&#xD;
subsided at once; being the youngest they knew&#xD;
they were in the greatest danger of banishment.&#xD;
The old porch vas neglected now, for the even-&#xD;
ings had grown so chilly. A cheerful fire blazed&#xD;
on the hearth in the sitting-room, and sent a ruddy&#xD;
glow over.the' white walls and simple furniture. A&#xD;
little round stand was in the middle of the room,&#xD;
on which burned two tallow candles. Mrs. Win-&#xD;
throp and Annie had honored the occasion by&#xD;
"only knitting to-night." There was so muchto&#xD;
say they wanted to give their whole attention.&#xD;
Deacon Winthrop sat in his armed-chair in the&#xD;
corner revealing, even by the "fitful fire-light,"' a&#xD;
face on, which was written, in well defined expres-&#xD;
sion, "Godliness with contentment is great gain."&#xD;
Ernest sat opposite him with little Mary on his lap.&#xD;
Grace's face was lowing with animation as she&#xD;
repeated incident after incident of her visit. Ar-&#xD;
thur sat on a low  ench at her side. Henry leaned&#xD;
over the back of her chair and played with her&#xD;
curls, expressing thus his caressing gladness at her&#xD;
return; while Charles, a step.higher in the scale&#xD;
of boyhood, sat demurely in his chair quietly di-&#xD;
viding- his attention between .Grace's story and&#xD;
Ernest's new clothes. It was a beautiful picture,&#xD;
over and around which the light of home love was&#xD;
laying.&#xD;

inthrop dwell on the words, "Bless the Lord, oh&#xD;

Even little Mary never forgot her father's prayer&#xD;
at night; it seemed to fold them all so tenderly&#xD;

CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
DOCTOR ALLERTON.&#xD;
MONG the first items of news which Annie&#xD;
communicated, was the arrival of a new doc-&#xD;
at Beechford. Old Doctor Stanhope had min-&#xD;
red long and faithfully. He was regarded as one&#xD;
he institutions of the place; but of late years&#xD;
strength had declined, and the fact that he must&#xD;
ner or later.give his duties into younger hands,&#xD;
growing more and more apparent. Nobody&#xD;
compelled to take the responsibility of inviting 'a&#xD;
one into the place. As long as Doctor Stan-&#xD;
e could ride out, he seemed a reliance. Sud-&#xD;
ly Doctor Allerton appeared in their midst,&#xD;
ging very reliable credentials from very re-&#xD;
ctable sources. He called on some of the lead-&#xD;
people of the town, and received from them suffi-&#xD;
nt e encouragement to decide him to take up his&#xD;
)de w th them for the present. He had procured&#xD;
oardi g place.in a good location, near the cen-&#xD;
of t e town, and, by the middle of November,&#xD;
ectel to establish himself in Beechford.&#xD;
How old is he ?" asked Ernest.&#xD;
Twenty-eight, I believe."&#xD;
Is he good looking ?"&#xD;

"He i s fine looking, and very social and gen-&#xD;
tlemanly, 57ou would never think of calling him&#xD;
handsome; 'but there is something about him wh ch&#xD;
attracts your attention and commands your respect.&#xD;
Father and mother liked him very much. By the&#xD;
way, Ernest, he proposed to father to take a class&#xD;
of young ladies and gentlemen for the winter. He&#xD;
said he, should probably have to wait for practice;&#xD;
and if Mrs. Lee would let him have an extra room,&#xD;
he could devote a couple of hours three evenings&#xD;
in each week to recitations, with the privilege of&#xD;
being professionally absent, if it should be neces-&#xD;
sary. Ordinary practice he could regulate so as&#xD;
not to interfere with these hours."&#xD;
"Capital !" said Ernest; "just the thing we want.&#xD;
I will call on Doctor Allerton this very evening."&#xD;
"But he will not be here in two weeks; so mod-&#xD;
erate your joy, young man," said Annie, with mock&#xD;
gravity.&#xD;
."Well, then, I'll do what I can to get up a class&#xD;
when he gets here. I shall have time enough to&#xD;
study, these .long winter evenings. I have been&#xD;
wishing, of all things, for just this opportunity ;&#xD;
and it has come almost as unexpectedly as my new&#xD;
suit did. Hurrah for Dodtbr Allerton, say I! Be-&#xD;
hold me, his attached friend !"&#xD;
"hReally !" said Annie, ' you begin your rejoic-&#xD;
ings in good season. Yogi had'better wait and see&#xD;
where the scholars are coining'from."&#xD;
"No, I sha'n't wait. I m going to do allI can to&#xD;
help him find scholars, and if nobody else cares to&#xD;
study, I think I shall offer myself as a private pupil.&#xD;
I can't get sick, to induce him to stay ; but I'm&#xD;

" Suppose you should be disappointed in him ?"&#xD;
"From your account, I do not expect to be."&#xD;
A nie," said Grace,' " do you believe mother&#xD;
'ill let me go? I want to go to school this winter,&#xD;
nd I m sure this will be an excellent opportunity.&#xD;
believe Julia Thorn, and Mary Ross, and all the&#xD;
irls will go."&#xD;
"Yes," said Ernest, "I'll answer for her. Mother&#xD;
lways approves of schools. So 'll put you down&#xD;
cholar number two, and leave  ou to make the&#xD;
rrangements for getting there.  ome, I'll go with&#xD;
ou to Julia Thorn's this evening, and get her name&#xD;

"The very thing I wanted you to do. I have&#xD;
carcely seen Julia since I came back, and I've got&#xD;
great deal to tell her."&#xD;
"But, remember, you go in my interests to-&#xD;
ight ;-first the school, and your talk afterwards."&#xD;
Ernest's efforts for the next few eenings were&#xD;
ond rfully successful. He had twenty names&#xD;
nough to form a fine clasa of really determined&#xD;
pint. Charlie and Julia Thorn Edward Nelson,&#xD;
nd   ary Ross, were among the  embers.&#xD;
Gr ce had obtained her mother's permission to&#xD;
join t e class. Mrs. Winthrop did not exactly like&#xD;
n evening school, but as the necessities of her son&#xD;
ould be met in no oth r way, sh made as few ob-&#xD;
ectio s as possible.  here were fher good moth.&#xD;

FIFTY YEARS AGO.&#xD;
&#xD;
For convenience, it was arranged that each&#xD;
young man, in his turn, should carry all the pupils&#xD;
in his neighborhood. They had yet to submit&#xD;
their plans to Doctor Allerton, and now his coming&#xD;
had grown to be very important.&#xD;
Doctor Allerton came at the appointed time, and&#xD;
was quite'surprised to find himself so anxiously&#xD;
expected and so warmly welcomed by Ernest Win-&#xD;
throp, Charles Thorn, and Edward Nelson, as a&#xD;
committee from the class to make arrangements for&#xD;
hearing their recitations. He met them very cor-&#xD;
dially, and after talking the subject over in its va-&#xD;
rious aspects, he invited. thenA to call with the&#xD;
whole number of proposed pupils the next evening.&#xD;
The evenings they mentioned would suit his con-&#xD;
venience. At present they interfered with none of&#xD;
his arrangements. It must be understood that he&#xD;
should be at liberty to attend to any unexpected&#xD;
call. The young men left, highly pleased with&#xD;
their interview, and quite enthusiastic over their&#xD;
plans for study.&#xD;
And now, a word about Doctor Allerton. He&#xD;
was, as Annie said, about twenty-eight years old,&#xD;
with a strong, well-developed physical frame. His&#xD;
eyes were deep hazel, and full of expression. There&#xD;
was something in them which made you involun-&#xD;
tarily feel that their owner looked beneath the sur-&#xD;
face and was forming an opinion of his own. His&#xD;
firm, well-set mouth expressed fixedness of purpose.&#xD;
He had fine natural talents, was gifted with a rare&#xD;
memory, which placed his knowledge of men and&#xD;
books at a ready and practical command. His&#xD;
manners were courteous, and his powers of conver-&#xD;

tion unusually fine. He had studied faithfully,&#xD;
ad a natural love for his profession, and a hopeful&#xD;
ispos tion to inspire his efforts: All ready to work!&#xD;
ut" there .should he go ?" had been a difficult&#xD;
uestion to solve. Cities and larger places were&#xD;
lled with toilers in his profession, and he had no&#xD;
ieans to support him in years of waiting. The&#xD;
oungest of a large family, he had been tenderly&#xD;
sared by a widowed mother, and received from&#xD;
er such lessons of wisdom, that his heart was filled&#xD;
rith high purposes and, earnest desires for useful-&#xD;
ess. "Do not be ambitious about place, my son,"&#xD;
te had said to.him, when he was filled with anx-&#xD;
ity a out his field for labor. "Fird something to&#xD;
o, and do it well. Then leave the results with&#xD;
rod. Honor him, and he will honor you enough&#xD;
r your earthly needs." His uncle, whom he had&#xD;
onsulted, and who was himself a physician of high&#xD;
andi g, had recommended his present location.&#xD;
Bee hford is a quiet town," said he, "possessing&#xD;
reat natural beauty. The people are staid and&#xD;
itelligent. I think you will find strong elements&#xD;
f growth among them. You will not want for&#xD;
lateri l on which to exercise your knowledge and&#xD;
kill, for disease reveals itself as surely in the coun-&#xD;
ry as in the city. A well stored mind, capable of&#xD;
ringi g its power to bear upon the occasion, is at&#xD;
ome, and in its place, be that place city or coun-&#xD;
ry." So, taking his letters of introduction, he had&#xD;
ome to Beechford to meet with as cordial a re.&#xD;
eption as any stranger could, expect. The plan of&#xD;
°achi g had suggested itself as'accomplishing a&#xD;
iree- old purpose. It would be a slight foothold&#xD;

in the way of certain occupations. It would&#xD;
him into closer acquaintance with the young&#xD;
ple, and it would open a way of usefulness i&#xD;
parting instruction to others. Of course, it&#xD;
cheering to find himself so pleasantly expe&#xD;
when, with his few worldly effects, one chilly&#xD;
vember day, he returned to take up his abo&#xD;

&#xD;
On the appointed evening, the young physician&#xD;
received the proposed members of his class in-Mrs.&#xD;
Lee's pleasant sitting-room. His easy, happy man-&#xD;
ner did much towards overcoming the stiffness of&#xD;
the occasion. He made his inquiries of each one&#xD;
so quietly, and drew them out so unconsciously,&#xD;
that the reserve gradually wore away, and he was&#xD;
enabled to get some definite idea of the plan of&#xD;
study best adapted to their wants. He arranged&#xD;
for as few classes as possible, made suggestions as&#xD;
they occurred to him, and formed a general plan&#xD;
subject to such improvements as his better knowl-&#xD;
edge of their needs would enable him to adopt.&#xD;
As he knew better than they where, and how: to&#xD;
buy books, it was proposed that he should furnish&#xD;
them. This would cause some delay, and as Thanks-&#xD;
giving was not far off, he suggested that they should&#xD;
wait until its festivities were passed before they&#xD;
entered upon their winter's work.&#xD;
Thi4 met with a cordial response from them all.&#xD;
And thus their first meeting passed pleasantly&#xD;
away. They were pleased with Doctor Allerton,&#xD;
pleased with the new arrangements, and pleased&#xD;
with each other.&#xD;

encouraged Grace's going,'. aid waited anxi&#xD;
to hear her first impressions of the underta&#xD;
"Come, tell us all about it," said she, as so&#xD;
Grace drew her chair up to the fire.&#xD;
"I was half frightened to death when&#xD;
said 'this is my sister Grace, Doctor Allerton,&#xD;
I remembered that 'sister Grace' had come t&#xD;
her lesson to him. I don't think I could hav&#xD;
him my own name,.but he did not seem to n&#xD;
it, and after awhile I felt less strange, and b&#xD;

quite composed. He is a gentleman, but I&#xD;
think I should ever dare look off of my b&#xD;
minute in his school-room. The girls we&#xD;
frightened, but now they think they shall&#xD;

Annie laughed, and asked Ernest how lon&#xD;
thought Grace would remain so awe-struck&#xD;
keep her ey s in one place a whole evening.&#xD;
"Not lon ," said Ernest, "but the girls all&#xD;
as if they were going through some wonderfi&#xD;

given.him some insight into his silehtly-che&#xD;
future plans&#xD;
Doctor A lerton had also spent one eveni&#xD;
Deacon Winthrop's, where he mad  himself&#xD;
agi-eeable by his intelligent conversation and&#xD;
ing address. Grace sewed assiduously the&#xD;
evening, only now and then stoppin to ans&#xD;
question- he put. directly to her.  e seem&#xD;
old and stately, compared with Ernest, C&#xD;
Thorn  and   Edward  Nelson -hr and&#xD;
Thorn's particular friends. She thought he&#xD;
properly belonged to her father and  other&#xD;
Uncle Henry. Doctorspiturally were oldi&#xD;
estimation. Doctor Stanhope was and a&#xD;
had been, far anything she had see  to the&#xD;
trary ; and, of course, Doctor Allerton ou&#xD;
be; and she was sure he seemed   o, hew&#xD;
grave and dignified.&#xD;

"I thought you like Doctor Allerton."&#xD;
" So I do, in his way. But he is so old and&#xD;
wise. I want to 1ugh and be happy over my&#xD;
Thanksgiving-dinner, and I shall feel as .solemn as&#xD;

" It would be a pity to make you 4#ela'ncholy on&#xD;

"I don't care. I don't want him to come. Do&#xD;

"Let'it go, daughter," said Deacon Winthrop.&#xD;
"Mother will not miss him, and you may lahigh&#xD;
as much as you like. I suppose you do not object&#xD;

Henry on account of their age."&#xD;
" Oh! no, indeed! They are part of my Thanks-&#xD;

Annie blushingly told her that she should be&#xD;

Thanksgiving morning dawned one of the 1&#xD;
est, cheeriest of the whole month. There w&#xD;
keenness enough in the air to make it exhil&#xD;
and send the blood tingling through the vei&#xD;
parting -a glowing life, which made itself f4&#xD;
a blessed possession.&#xD;
Aunt Nannie and Aunt Lois were always&#xD;
of the Winthrop's on Thanksgiving -day..&#xD;
usually rode' to, church with them aind cam4&#xD;
to dinner, but to-day Aunt Lois insisted upo&#xD;
ing at home to help "Mis' Winthrop."&#xD;
"I reckon I can fix potatoes and turnips&#xD;
equal to any body. Let Annie and Grace b(&#xD;
to meeting, and I'll look after things while th&#xD;
gone."&#xD;
To "look after things" meant a great deal&#xD;
Aunt Lois said it.  Annie and Grace kn&#xD;
well what an extensive ground it covered&#xD;
they felt that their places would be well sup&#xD;
so they weje soon ready to go with the rest&#xD;
family to church. ,The boys wore their new&#xD;
nut-colored suits and Mary her  right,&#xD;
dress.&#xD;
The sermon was sound and excellent, but&#xD;
scarcely appreciated by the younger meml&#xD;
the congregation, their thoughts were so oc&#xD;
with sundry things at home. If Grace, for&#xD;
meant, felt t at she had been selfish in not w&#xD;
Doctor Allerton to share in their leasant&#xD;
dinner, she was relieved when Julia  horn tc&#xD;
that he was invited to dine with their good]&#xD;
Mr. *ilson.&#xD;

Aunt Lois had lighted the wood which. Ernest&#xD;
had laid in the fire-place in the "spare room." It&#xD;
glowed and sparkled, and sent up fantastic flames,&#xD;
and looked cheery enough to wake up a spirit of&#xD;
thankfulness in anybody's heart.&#xD;
The old mirror opposite reflected its glow, and&#xD;
seemed to kindle and keep up just such a fire, on&#xD;
its side of the room; even the cherry tables tried to&#xD;
twinkle with little fires all over their polished sur-&#xD;
faces. In the sitting-room, the bright blaze leaped&#xD;
out between the great sticks cf walnut-wood, then&#xD;
suddenly disappeared, and soon revealeditself in&#xD;
a broad, enveloping sheet, sending out such waves&#xD;
of genial warmth that they pervaded every corner&#xD;
of the room. The door between the two rooms&#xD;
was open, and everything wore a festal look, which&#xD;
the fires seemed to vie with eachother in keeping&#xD;
up. Modern furnaces warm as well, but they haye&#xD;
no language, they are dull, gloomy, uninviting&#xD;
companions, only tolerated because they are so&#xD;
convenient. When the dear, old -fashioned fire-&#xD;
light went. out, a charming household spirit went&#xD;
with it. That spirit was at the old mansion to-day&#xD;
working faithfully, and well did it succeed.&#xD;
The dinner-table was always in the sitting-room&#xD;
on Thanksgiving-day. -This was left for Grace to&#xD;
arrange-only Grace could produce such an effect&#xD;
with such limited means. Every choice 5lish the&#xD;
house afforded was pressed into service, and with&#xD;
the ground-pine, "Everlasting," and bitter-sweet&#xD;
berries, which she and Aunt Lois had- collected,&#xD;
the table was prettily adorned.  There were&#xD;
bunches of ground-pine, dotted witi everlasting,&#xD;

Grace transferred these things to the table, Mrs.&#xD;
Winthrop disappeared to.add a few touches to her&#xD;
holiday dress.&#xD;
Then the family, fourteen in all, gathered round&#xD;
the table. Grandfather always asked the blessing&#xD;
on Thanksgiving-days. The .family stood instead&#xD;
of sitting while he said grace in his own peculiar&#xD;
patriarchal way. The clatter of knives, forks and&#xD;
plates announced that the feast had begun. Every-&#xD;
thing was goo1, and enjoyed to its fullest extent.&#xD;
Love presided, giving to grandfather's laugh a&#xD;
merry ring, and to grandmother's faded face and&#xD;
silvery hair a quiet beauty; it touched father,&#xD;
mother and Uncle Henry with smooth "erasing&#xD;
fingers,", making the care lines almost invisible.&#xD;
It revealed itself to Annie, Ernest and Grace in&#xD;
bows of golden promise, and into the children's&#xD;
hearts it poured floods of undefined happiness over&#xD;
which no shadow rested ; it whispered gently to&#xD;
Aunt Nannie and Aunt Lois that past trials were&#xD;
only seeds of quiet joy ripening in their autumn&#xD;
years, and enduring enough to afford them shelter&#xD;
as far into life's winter as they should need.&#xD;

blessing, mde for us such a starting point in, life,&#xD;
and whose influence over us can never end.&#xD;
Mrs. Wiinthrop realized it as her eye rested fond-&#xD;
ly on the faces of her father and mother. She felt&#xD;
that in the home where she was mother, her moth-&#xD;
er's life work was carried on, and that her father's&#xD;
wisdom and counsel had made her stronger for the&#xD;
right.&#xD;
Ernest in his new suit was the perfect admira-&#xD;
tion of his brothers, while Annie and Grace in&#xD;
their bright ribbons, looked more than beautiful to&#xD;
them. Mary expressed her views particularly to&#xD;
her confidant Arthur, and taking it altogether was&#xD;
one of the most satisfied little beings that day's&#xD;
Thanksgiv ng sun shone upon.&#xD;
"Don't you feel sorry, Grace, that you would&#xD;
not let Doctor Allerton have a taste of this good&#xD;
dinner?". hispered Ernest, as h  sat next his&#xD;
sister.&#xD;
"No!    hy should I.  Mr. Wilson took him&#xD;
home with him, besides, if we had any company, I&#xD;
should rather have Julia and Charli Thorn."&#xD;
Doctor Allerton's con ing was fully discussed by&#xD;
the older members of the family, an was approved&#xD;
of by all. Doctor. Stanhope had received him&#xD;
kindly, and expressed himself as  eling relieved&#xD;
from a heavy burden by his coming. He had re-.&#xD;
ceived no professional calls as yet, but he had only&#xD;
been there two weeks, and it was a time of unusual&#xD;
health.&#xD;
Grand other did not know about the evening-&#xD;
school. ay-time seemed best to her for such&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
things, still she wanted Ernest to attend it, and&#xD;
that rather modified her views.&#xD;
When dinner was over, Aunt Lois.said, "Now,&#xD;
Mis' Winthrop, fou go right in the other room, and&#xD;
see 'your folks,( Nannie and I don't want you&#xD;
'round. Annie and Grace may clear off the table&#xD;
and put things to rights in this room, and then we&#xD;
don't want any more of them."&#xD;
Mrs. Winthrop hesitated,. but Aunt Lois again&#xD;
assured her that she would "look after things,"&#xD;
which in this case meant put all the broken&#xD;
pieces and right slices into the baskets waiting to.&#xD;
receive them when their poor owners came for&#xD;
them .before dark. Aunt' Lois knew the li~t of&#xD;
Mrs. Winthrop's "poor folks," and Mrs. Winhrop&#xD;
knew her kindness and judgment were equal te the&#xD;
occasion, so she went in with her father, mother,&#xD;
and husband, to chat by the glowing fire in the&#xD;
spare room. The children were in and out, some-&#xD;
times bringing wood to heap on the fire, then a&#xD;
pan of walnuts which they had cracked for even-&#xD;
ing, to see if here was enough, and then a basket&#xD;
of rosy - cheeked apples, to see if they were the&#xD;
right kind, until' the daylight began to fade, and&#xD;
grandfather and grandmother mu t go home be-&#xD;
fore it was gone,&#xD;
Then evening came, the fires sent up fresh glows,&#xD;
and reddened the white walls, and looked as cheery&#xD;
as the children felt: Grace brought extra candles,&#xD;
and drew up the chairs for Aunt Nannie and Aunt&#xD;
Lois where her grandfather and grandmother had&#xD;
.sat. Aunt Nannie thot ght they had better go&#xD;
home before dark, but thechildre all wanted them&#xD;

Annie smiled at Grace's earnestness; it seemed&#xD;
as if she had grown suddenly thoughtful: She had&#xD;
always been efficient, but had not yet learned to&#xD;
bring this efficiency to uniform action. Now she&#xD;
must have a definite time for study. If it was only&#xD;
summer-time, and she could sit in the window&#xD;
where she spun the flax,. she could secure plenty&#xD;
of quiet. One thing she could do. Aunt. Nannie&#xD;
always had a good fire. and a quiet corner; here&#xD;
she could retreat at any time and be always wel-&#xD;
come with only the buzz of the spinning-wheel to&#xD;
interrupt her. Aunt Nannie'was rather doubtful&#xD;
about the wisdom of going to school evenings; but&#xD;
Ernest and Grace had got.it into their heads to&#xD;
go, and she supposed there would be no stopping&#xD;
them. So it was settled that Grace's chairshould&#xD;
always be ready ii the corner fot cher whenever&#xD;
she chose to take it.&#xD;
It was Ernest who was to take the neighborhood&#xD;
circle the first evening. Deacon Winthrop wished&#xD;
to aid him as much as possible, so he harnessed&#xD;

Grace's heart beat faster than it id when they&#xD;
started for Boston. She actually felt more per-&#xD;
sonal responsibility. They found the four belong-&#xD;
ing to theirkcompany waiting to coe out, and&#xD;
punctually at seven o'clock they, were seated in&#xD;
Mrs. Lee's pleasant sitting-room. The whole twen-&#xD;
ty were there. Doctor Allerton  et them with&#xD;
an ease and cordiality which made them feel that&#xD;
he was glad to see them. He had purchased the&#xD;
books; and after these were talked over, he pro-&#xD;
ceeded to arrange the classes, and in a familiar,&#xD;
conversations way give various suggestions about&#xD;
studying. Their work was so. laid out that on&#xD;
Wednesday evening they could begi in earnest.&#xD;
It was soon "next week," and he beginning&#xD;
over, and then the skillfully-conducted classes&#xD;
moved smoothly on with a steadily-growing inter-&#xD;
est in their work. Doctor Allerton. as an excel-&#xD;
lent instructor, and was fast gaining their respect.&#xD;
He was beginning to be occupied professionally&#xD;
too. His first case was one of surgery, which he&#xD;
attended so successfully that it aforded him a&#xD;
pleasant introduction to others. He had a case or&#xD;
two of fever. The various pains an aches which&#xD;
come and go wherever man abides, aimed his at.&#xD;
tention enough to -make quite an important ent y&#xD;
on his day-book. Occasionally he was absent from&#xD;
his evening circle; then Ernest, at his and t-he pu-&#xD;
pils' request, presided.&#xD;

It was a winter long remembered by the young&#xD;
people of Beechford. They had all varieties of&#xD;
wind and weather ; but as no one had to be driver&#xD;
all of the time, they did not mind it in their turns.&#xD;
Sometimes when the sleighing was fine, and the&#xD;
moon brought out the glorious frost-work in forms&#xD;
of unspeakable beauty, we will not call them un-&#xD;
scholarly if there *as some changing of seats, and&#xD;
the ride home was  a few miles longer than usual.&#xD;
Once, on such an evening, Doctor Allerton's sleigh&#xD;
was standing at the door when they all came out.&#xD;
He had some calls to make, and as he stood wait-&#xD;
ing to see them off, Ernest playfully said, "Your&#xD;
sleigh looks lonely, Doctor Allerton."&#xD;
"I was just thinking so; perhaps you will lend&#xD;
me a little cheer from yours. Miss Grace, I think&#xD;
your brother will not accuse me of trespassing if I&#xD;
ask you to change your seat in his sleigh for one&#xD;
in mine."&#xD;
The, proposition was so unexpected that Grace&#xD;
hardly took it in before the doctor was extending&#xD;
his hand to assist her out from the comfortable seat&#xD;
where she was stowed away between Julia Thorn&#xD;
and Edward Nelson. She knew the girls were&#xD;
smiling at her discomfiture. A tete-a-tete ride with&#xD;
Doctor Allerton in exchange-for the capital time&#xD;
she was going to have with her boon companions !&#xD;
He inspired her with respect. She always admired&#xD;
him when he conversed with others; but if he ad&#xD;
dressed her particularly, she usually answered him&#xD;
in monosyllables, without any attempt to .prolong&#xD;
the conversation. Now here she was actually rid-&#xD;
ing alone with him. She hoped Ernest would go&#xD;

home the shortest way, but instead.of that he turn.&#xD;
ed the corner for a half hour's longer ride, and&#xD;
Doctor Allerton turned the corner too.&#xD;
"Will not this detain you from your patient,&#xD;
Doctor Allerton ?" asked Grace.&#xD;
" Oh ! no, I have plenty of time ; besides, 'I must&#xD;
see your brother safe home."&#xD;
Happily the doctor asked her some questions&#xD;
about her visit at Boston; this put her quite at her&#xD;
ease, and before she knew it she was talking and&#xD;
he was listening. They were just behind Ernest&#xD;
when he stopped to leave his first way passengers.&#xD;
Doctor Allerton passed him with a cheerful good-&#xD;
night, and reached Deacon Winthrop's just in ad-&#xD;
vance of him.&#xD;
Will you go in ?" said Grace, rather doubtfully,&#xD;
as he held open the gate for her.&#xD;
"Not-tonght, thank you ;" and he drove away&#xD;
leaving her standing in the porch waiting for Er.&#xD;
nest to come up.&#xD;
After the horses were disposed of, Ernest joined&#xD;
his sisters by the warm fire in the sitting-room.&#xD;
Grace had been telling Annie of their evening les-&#xD;
sons, but said nothing of her ride home. Ernest&#xD;
looked very smiling as he poked the fire and drew&#xD;
the brands closer together, and then he asked.&#xD;
Grace how she liked the teacher out of school.&#xD;
"Only think of it, Annie !" said he, "Grace ac-&#xD;
tually rode home with so 'old and wise' a man as&#xD;
Doctor Allerton."&#xD;
" Is it possible !" said Annie, "how did that hap-.&#xD;
pen?" '&#xD;
" Why, Ernest, of course, had something to do&#xD;

with it; he expressed so much sympathy for Doc-&#xD;
tor Allertonrs loneliness that he offered to take me&#xD;
home, to show him how much he appreciated it."&#xD;
"Well, Grace, a man must have something be-&#xD;
sides books and medicine, scholars and sick folks.&#xD;
I don't knoW but Mrs. Allerton elect writes to him&#xD;
every day, but he did look lonely to-night ; of&#xD;
course I did not think of his asking you to ride&#xD;
with him. You always look so demure when he is&#xD;
around, I s would not think he would expect much&#xD;
cheer from  ou. Did you discourse on the benefit&#xD;
of pills and powders ?"&#xD;
"Ernest, you are too bad; we did not talk about&#xD;
medicine og, books either. I always imagined he&#xD;
was bound up in both. Come to think of it, I be--&#xD;
lieve I did most of the talking; but what did the&#xD;
girls say to my sudden leave-taking?"&#xD;
"Julia laughed heartily, but I don't believe Ned&#xD;
Thorn liked it quite so well;.it took a good deal&#xD;
of the fun out of him, On the front seat we got&#xD;
along very nicely without you; only I kept think-&#xD;
.ing what a colding I should get when I got home&#xD;
for my innocent share in the matter; but if Doctor&#xD;
Allerton only got you to talking, yoU enjoyed it, I&#xD;
know."&#xD;
"Is Doctor AllertQn engaged ?" asked Annie.&#xD;
"You spoke of Mrs. Allerton elect."&#xD;
"I never heard a word about it. I only sup-&#xD;
posed he might be, -sensible men usually. are.-&#xD;

very sleepy, and if this fire will do to cover up, I&#xD;
think we had all better go to bed."&#xD;
" I promised mother that I would look after the.&#xD;

fire," said Annie; ".so you can go to bed as soon&#xD;
as you like."&#xD;
There was little time for idleness that whole win-&#xD;
ter in the Winthrop household. Except to spend&#xD;
a day with her grandmother. once a week, Grace&#xD;
rarely went out. Her books, her household duties,&#xD;
and her needle, kept her constantly busy. Meet-&#xD;
ing the young circle to which she belonged three,&#xD;
evenings in a week, and in their rides to and from&#xD;
Mrs. Lee's, she found no lack of social pleasures.&#xD;
She could always secure a quiet hour at Aunt&#xD;
Nannie's fireside, when the busy sounds of home&#xD;
were likely to trespass too. far on her attention.&#xD;
Sometimes Aunt Lois would forget that "the&#xD;
child" could not study and talk at the same time,&#xD;
'but after awhile she held the .study hour quite sa-&#xD;
cred, and kept all of her thoughts and questions to&#xD;
herself, until it was over.&#xD;
One morning, in February, Grace had taken her&#xD;
books and her sewing and started to spend the day&#xD;
with her grandmother. The clear, bracing air,&#xD;
and the smooth, well-trodden snow made the walk-&#xD;
ing very agreeable. She felt just like enjoying it.&#xD;
The hills, and the trees, and the white-robed earth&#xD;
never appeared to her n ore grandly beautiful than&#xD;
on this winter morning. Out from her full heart&#xD;
came the thought of whata beautiful world this is,&#xD;
and how much there is in it to make one very&#xD;
glad. She had been so absorbed in her own re-'.&#xD;
flections that she had not even heard the sound of&#xD;
sleigh-bells. The pleasant voice of Doctor Aller-&#xD;
ton aroused her with a " Good morning, Miss&#xD;
Grace."&#xD;
&#xD;
FIFTY YEARS AGO.&#xD;
&#xD;
131&#xD;
&#xD;
",Why, Doctor Allerton! I did. not hear your&#xD;
bells."&#xD;
"I though t not," said he: " or else you intended&#xD;
to make me tipset in this bank, in turning out for&#xD;
you. I dro   quite slowly before  knew who it&#xD;
was, hoping  should get my share of the road, at&#xD;
least. You must allow me to keep you out of dan-&#xD;
ger the res tof the way,"said he, stepping out of.&#xD;
his sleigh a offering to help her in.&#xD;
Grace th riked him. She did not care to ride.&#xD;
She was only going to grandmother's, and needed&#xD;
the exercise 6f walking.&#xD;
"You can take that to-morrow," said he, still&#xD;
holding out is hand to assist her. Grace took it,&#xD;
and allowed im to seat her in his sleigh, wishing&#xD;
in her heart hat she had walked 'faster and turned&#xD;
the corner, little way beyond, before he overtook&#xD;
her.&#xD;
Doctor   lerton had just come from the bed-&#xD;
side of a p  r suffering man, one whose "bed of&#xD;
languishing' had no divine support. He had been&#xD;
full of sad thoughts; and when that bright, glow-&#xD;
ing face looked upon him so suddenly, he felt that&#xD;
it was like carrying a sunbeam. To have it in his&#xD;
sleigh for a little time would brighten the whole&#xD;
.day. He hJ quickly discovered that Grace Win-&#xD;
throp. wasn ordinary girl. Her recitations were&#xD;
excellent. 'he comprehended things easily, and&#xD;
was in her class, as everywhere else, a leading&#xD;
spirit, yet she never seemed to know it. She was&#xD;
so unselfish, 1oo ; the happiness of others was a&amp;amp;p$'r&#xD;
of her happy ness. Her ready, appreciating syii&#xD;

right place. Her laugh was full of merriment.&#xD;
Nothing escaped her quick perceptive faculties.&#xD;
Doctor Allerton had observed her easy flow of&#xD;
conversation with her companions, and had been&#xD;
highly entertained at her remarks, when he was&#xD;
not directly listening. To him she was always re-&#xD;
served. If he called at her father's house, she&#xD;
seemed to consider him as belonging to the elder&#xD;
members of the family. The evening she rode&#xD;
home with him from Mrs. Lee's was the first time&#xD;
she ever really talked with him. His skill in-the&#xD;
selection of a subject had drawn her out very suc-&#xD;
cessfully, Since then her bow and smile had been&#xD;
more kindly, but it was always as if their pathways&#xD;
were in different directions. He had an instinctive&#xD;
idea that if Charlie Thorn or Edward Nelson had&#xD;
overtaken her this morning, she would have bound-&#xD;
ed into either of their sleighs, almost without an&#xD;
invitation, and chatted gayly the whole way. 'Why&#xD;
did she take his offered seat so reluctantly?&#xD;
"You seem to be a combination of occupations,"&#xD;
said he. "Books and work-baskets are both rep-&#xD;
resented."&#xD;
" Oh, yes," said she; "time is very precious&#xD;
now. I must work when I visit, or else not visit&#xD;
at all. Cousin Laura asked me if w e did not get.&#xD;
very dull in the country, especially in winter. I&#xD;
think if she could see how this.winter is passing,.&#xD;
she  woild ask how we got along with so little&#xD;
timee"&#xD;
"Do you find your studies irksome ?"&#xD;
"Not in the least. - I enjoy them very much."&#xD;

"Don't you like the country ?"&#xD;
"Yes ; butthis beginning life among;strangers,&#xD;
with all the anxieties attending my profession,&#xD;
is often depressing. I have been to see a patient&#xD;
this morning who ought to be better, but he is&#xD;
not; he need a little of your cheerful spirit to tone&#xD;
up his system."&#xD;
Grace looked up astonished. Here was Doctor&#xD;
Allerton talk ng to her j st as Ernest would have&#xD;
done. He was not all hooks and medicine'then !&#xD;
and he was lonesome and discouraged sometimes&#xD;
just like other people. She had never thoughtyif&#xD;
him in this light before, and a touch of something,&#xD;
akin to symp thy filled her heart for him It wvas&#xD;
not exactly lke riding with Doctor Stanhope, after&#xD;
all,and her manner was more free and cordialtlhan&#xD;
it had ever been before with him.&#xD;
He left her at her grandfather's. The cheerfTul&#xD;
old man was standing at his gate as they drove up.&#xD;
He saluted the doctor very cordially, and expressed&#xD;
his satisfaction that he had so much to do. Doc-&#xD;
tor Allerton declined his invitation to go in, and&#xD;
drove ~away, cheered by the little interview he had&#xD;
had with Grace Winthrop.&#xD;
"Riding out with Doctor. Allerton, this fine&#xD;
morning, eh, Grage !" said her grandfather, as he&#xD;
poked the  re and sent the sparks fl ing up the&#xD;
wide chimney.&#xD;
" He over ook me, grandfather, and asked me.&#xD;

to ride; so I could not very well help it, you&#xD;
see."&#xD;
"Need n't help it, child ! it is alwaysbetter to&#xD;
ride than it is to walk, when you can just as well as&#xD;
not. Doctor Allerton is a young man of great&#xD;
promise, I think. Did you hear him say how Mr.&#xD;
Fleming is this morning ?"&#xD;
"Not any better, I believe."&#xD;
"I'm afraid he won't be, poor man. It's my&#xD;
opinion that his mind is more in fault than his body.&#xD;
He's very fretful, they say. It's a dreadful thing&#xD;
to be old, without an interest in Jesus Christ. I&#xD;
remember talking with Fleming some years ago.&#xD;
He told me there was plenty of time to look after&#xD;
another world when sickness and old age gave a&#xD;
person nothing else to do, and now he is finding&#xD;
out his great mistake. His great mistake !" said&#xD;
the old man, musingly; "his 'want has come like&#xD;
an armed man,' and there is nothing to supply it.&#xD;
'Cast me not off in the time of old age, forsake me&#xD;
not when my strength faileth."' He held his hands&#xD;
to the blaze, and seemed lost in his own tl oughts.&#xD;
Old age had come upon him like a finishin. touch,&#xD;
mellowing his heart, and making him ready for the&#xD;
harvest.&#xD;
Grace looked at his time-worn face and thought&#xD;
there was something beautiful in its calm repose.&#xD;
Now she began telling her grandmother of the&#xD;
little home incidents ,she always loved to hear,&#xD;
until, warned by the clock, she gathered up her&#xD;
books. " I will study awhile," said she, untill it&#xD;
is time to help you get dinner, grandmother."&#xD;
" No, child, I can get dinner without you as well&#xD;

to-day as yesterday. Attend to your lessons, be+&#xD;
fore anybody comes in to'interrupt you."&#xD;
So, in the. quiet of her grandmother's kitchen,&#xD;
she got possession of the remainder of her lesso s,&#xD;
and was ready for dinner ,and its after duti s.&#xD;
While her grandmother slept "just fifteen minute,&#xD;
and her grandfather dozed in his armed-chair, she&#xD;
sewed and thought over the lessons she had been&#xD;
learning.&#xD;
These quiet days were feasts to Grace. From&#xD;
her earliest childhood she had been often at her&#xD;
grandmother's; sometimes staying weeks at a time.&#xD;
As she grew older, she loved to listen to, the 4lsl&#xD;
lady's stories of her own childhood and youth.&#xD;
She almost fancied she was acquainted with 1he&#xD;
young people of her day. She knew all about her&#xD;
grandmother's two young sisters, who died of con-&#xD;
sumption, before they were twenty. years old. She&#xD;
sympathized in her loneliness after they were gone,&#xD;
and was always glad that she found such a dear,&#xD;
good companion as grandfather to cheer and com-&#xD;
fort her. Unconsciously this dear grandmother&#xD;
wove many an enduring truth into the woof of he&#xD;
young girl' life, which time brought out ith&#xD;
astonishing vividness. The fifteen minutes nap&#xD;
extended into half an hour, and then,'with  er&#xD;
clean cap and apron, grandmother took her eat&#xD;
by the south window, and, with her knitting-sheath&#xD;
adjusted, was ready to give-the. bright needles a&#xD;
chance to work. "I'm getting behind with  y&#xD;
knitting,". said she ; "the boys wear out their&#xD;
stockings so fast, that it will take us all to keep up&#xD;
with them. I don't know what your mother would&#xD;

do, if she hadn't Nannie and Lois to '&#xD;
wonderful to me how your mother does&#xD;
with all she has to do."&#xD;
" She is an uncommon smart woman," sa&#xD;
father, roused from his pleasant nap by t&#xD;
of his wife's voice, arid comprehending&#xD;
was speaking of "our Annie." " If you c&#xD;
as good a woman as your mother and grar&#xD;
Grace, I shall be satisfied."&#xD;
The short afternoon soon wore away&#xD;
set the table, while grandmother made the&#xD;
from a closet which was always mysterious&#xD;
with good things, brought out some extra&#xD;
to make the tea-table more tempting. Unc&#xD;
came in from a long business ride he 4&#xD;
taking, cold but cheery, and soon joined&#xD;
the table. After tea, Grace walked to M&#xD;
As it was only a short distance, she was&#xD;
ample time. Doctor Allerton was very su&#xD;
in his mode of instruction. He would&#xD;
questions which called out expression' f&#xD;
pupils. This evening, he and Ernest hadc&#xD;
discussion, which prolonged the allotted l&#xD;
made them rather late in starting for hon&#xD;
the horses were fleet, and the bells rang c&#xD;

SUMMER DAYS.&#xD;
TpIME has a way of hastening on, carrying days,&#xD;
weeks and months along with it. Just as you&#xD;
think you are nicely settled for winter, the pro-&#xD;
gramme of spring is before you, and you must lay&#xD;
aside what for the moment seemed a permanent&#xD;
way of living and take up something iew.&#xD;
Before our friends were half ready for them, the&#xD;
blue birds came and told, in sweet warbling strains,&#xD;
that winter was over, and with-it Doctor Allerton's&#xD;
school. It was a regretful parting. for all of them;&#xD;
they had enjoyed it, and felt that it had done them&#xD;
all good. Doctor Allerton was regarded as a fixture&#xD;
now. He had treated his cases with skill, and had&#xD;
gained the confidence of all whohad employed-&#xD;
him. He took an active interest in church matters,&#xD;
and was regarded by Mr. Wilson as 4 great addi-&#xD;
tion to the town. He had become well acquainted&#xD;
with the young people. His cultivated mindhav-&#xD;
ing been brought to bear so directly upon them,&#xD;
gave him an influence which he hpped to use&#xD;

I might as well despise the springs from w&#xD;

indeed, feed and sustain the moral and int&#xD;

positions, equal rights. It seems to me on&#xD;

From that spring-time, with all the en&#xD;
his strong will, Doctor Allerton set himselft&#xD;
out his life work in the quiet town of Beec&#xD;
No letters had come from Boston. But&#xD;
substantial proofs of their visit, Ernest and&#xD;
might have set it aside as a wonderfully p&#xD;
dream. They had only had time to talk it&#xD;
intervals, for the actual occupation .of ea&#xD;
had crowded out everything else.&#xD;
Ernest's school had closed, and-he was ag&#xD;
cupied with his father on the farm. Life a:&#xD;
tivity marked the opening season. As the&#xD;

who had come from school with a .violent head-&#xD;
ache, and was now so dull and sleepy that her moth-&#xD;
er's practiced eye discerned symptoms of illness&#xD;
which demanded immediate attention. Aunt Lois&#xD;
had been there all the afternoon, but her usual&#xD;
remedies had failed. She roused at hearing Grace's&#xD;
voice, but it was only momentary, she was too&#xD;
sleepy to respond to her inquiries.&#xD;
"We must send for the doctor right away," said&#xD;
'Mrs. Winthrop.&#xD;
"I shall go for Doctor Allerton," sail Ernest.&#xD;
"No," said his mother, "Doctor Stanhope has&#xD;

It would be very ungrateful to leave him now for&#xD;
a new one."&#xD;
"He is very feeble. :I saw him yesterday, and&#xD;
he looked as if he needed a 'doctor himself," said&#xD;
Ernest.&#xD;
"Well, I shall not forsake old friends for new.&#xD;
If you were sick, you could have who you chose.&#xD;
You must go for Doctor Stanhope first, and if he is&#xD;
not able to come, of course you must go for Doctor&#xD;
Allerton."&#xD;
Ernest was not long in finding Doctor Stanhope,&#xD;
too ill to attend to a patient, and Doctor Allerton at&#xD;
his office ready to accompany him. He was soon&#xD;
at the child's bedside, administering such remedies&#xD;
as her symptoms demanded.&#xD;
For nearly a week little Mary was very -ill, then&#xD;
her disease began to yield, leaving her feeble and&#xD;
very dependent on good n rsing for her recovery.&#xD;

140           FIFTY.YEARS AGO.&#xD;
&#xD;
Aunt Lois had been invaluable in her aid to Mrs.&#xD;
Winthrop and Annie during the doubtf1 days;&#xD;
but as the child grew better, she was left for Grace&#xD;
to nurse and amuse..&#xD;
I was July now. Grace would bring hr sister&#xD;
into the porch, and soothe and divert her in vari-&#xD;
ous ways. She grew stronger daily. Doctor llerton&#xD;
no longer came professionally, but he ofte found&#xD;
it convenient to drop in when Mary was comforta-&#xD;
bly seated in the armed chair, which was rought&#xD;
into the porch for her use, with her doll and its&#xD;
wardrobe on one side, and Grace and' the nend-&#xD;
ing-basket on the other. He always had scme en-&#xD;
tertaining story for the little invalid, making her&#xD;
quite; forget her doll and her  earjness, and Jausing&#xD;
Grace to wonder how a man who knew so much&#xD;
of books could tell a child's story so p ettily.&#xD;
These visits seemed all for Mary, and she looked&#xD;
for his coming with great eagerness. Sh4 even&#xD;
knew the sound of his horse's footsteps before he&#xD;
came in sight.&#xD;
Was it the shadowy coolness of the old eln,; was&#xD;
it the:deep interest he took in his fast conval scing&#xD;
patient,;or was it the bright, fair face he  as so&#xD;
sure to find a this hour attending the littl girl,&#xD;
that made him call so often ? No matter which, ome-&#xD;
thing made Doctor Allerton very attentive.  ary&#xD;
was such a pet in the household, that it was very&#xD;
easy to believe that anybody would take great&#xD;
pains to make her happy  but it came to an end.&#xD;
Mary was well again, and ran merrily abott en-&#xD;
tertaining herself. Grace went back to her hare&#xD;
of domestic duties, and I5octor Allerton called oc.&#xD;
&#xD;
FIFTY YEARS AGO. .        .141&#xD;
casionally, as a friend of the whole family,.though&#xD;
Mary claimed him as her special property.&#xD;
The harvest days ca e, and seemed very like the&#xD;
harvest days of the last yar. The old porch was&#xD;
again the family meeti g place at evening. A nd&#xD;
sometimes Ernest and Grace discussed the possi-&#xD;
bility of their uncle's coming in September.&#xD;
" Shall be glad to see him if he comes," said&#xD;
Deacon Winthrop, "but I hardly expect him.'&#xD;
Grace wondered if they would want her to go&#xD;
back with them. She was very doubtful of her&#xD;
own desire to do so, even if her father and mother&#xD;
shouldbe willing. It was to her -a peculiarly pleas-&#xD;
ant summer, she was busy and happy at. home.&#xD;
And after harvest, 'Ernest, Charlie Thorn and Ed-&#xD;
ward Nelson, got up such delightful berry parties&#xD;
and horseback excursions and rides to the lake,&#xD;
that she could .hardly tell where the days went,&#xD;
they glided along so full of work and play. ,She&#xD;
was at home on horseback. Caesar was her favor-&#xD;
ite for riding, she could gallop over the hills with&#xD;
Ernest, Charlie Thorn, or Edward Nelson, and not&#xD;
tire any .sooner than ,they. Her life was such a&#xD;
freedom from care, such a mingling of childhood&#xD;
and womanhood. Of course there were vexations&#xD;
and perplexities in her daily path, but they were&#xD;
such as 'ended with the passing event.&#xD;
"Grace !" said her mother, .one day, "how lit-&#xD;
tle you knob what life really is.'&#xD;
"Sevente'n years old and not. realize what .life&#xD;
is ! Why, m ther ! how strangely you talk."&#xD;
"1 suppose I do to' you, my child ;" and Mrs.&#xD;
Winthrop was silent, feeling how impossible it&#xD;

would be for her daughter to com&#xD;
thoughts, shadowed and shaped as t&#xD;
the realities, and responsibilities she&#xD;
through since she; was seventeen years&#xD;
With the conking of September&#xD;
strongly impressed-with the idea th&#xD;
would come. She took especial pains t&#xD;

Ernest's help she manufactured a toilet&#xD;
she draped with white, it was simple&#xD;
and the little mirror above it shone a&#xD;

facture, held a bywl and pitcher.&#xD;
curtains were very white, and looked&#xD;
they waved back and forth in the br&#xD;
daily aired and dusted the room, keep&#xD;
"if they should come,"a few chairs c&#xD;
furniture. A contrast truly to her aur&#xD;
surroundings in her own house, but&#xD;
was so relieved by its exquisite neat&#xD;
seemed inviting. Grace had a room b&#xD;
Mary always slept with Annie. Here&#xD;
sleep, and here she expended all her sk&#xD;
ing, and rearranging, until she thou&#xD;
available means she could do no more.&#xD;
It was the -second week in Septe&#xD;

t this moment, Deacon Winthrop came up on&#xD;
-sebacl from an opposite direction. Steadily&#xD;
two   en looked at each other. "It must be&#xD;

By this time Grace had come out to welcome&#xD;
her uncle followed by her mother a d Annie. The&#xD;
children meanwhile suddenly disappeared into their&#xD;
mother's bed-room,- leaving a crack of the door'&#xD;
open, so that they could get a clear idea of what&#xD;
was going.on. The carriage no  came up. On&#xD;
hearing it Charles and Henry jumped out of the&#xD;
window and ran into the garden to get a bet-&#xD;
ter view through the fence. It was truly a rare&#xD;
sight that cartage, and those horses. And when&#xD;
their uncle opened a door in the carriage, and let&#xD;
down some stairs, arid ,gave his hand to two such&#xD;
finely dressed ladies to come out, they were ready&#xD;
to believe that Cinderella and her coach had really,&#xD;
come.&#xD;
Mrs. Winthrdp nd Laura met Grace as if they&#xD;
had kno n he   always, and were very cordial to&#xD;
her mothr and sister.&#xD;
The windows of the spare roo  were quickly&#xD;
thrown open, and into it these goes s of state were&#xD;
invited.&#xD;
Mrs. Colonel -Winthrop and La ra knew very&#xD;
little of country life. Colonel Wintirop had given&#xD;
them no idea of his early home; understanding&#xD;
him as they did, they knew his heart was both glad&#xD;
and sad ; that lhe had come to what was to him a&#xD;
very dear spott, and they must resect and honor&#xD;
it, however plain and homely it might seem to&#xD;
them. Grace. 4as a little embarrassed at first. She&#xD;
felt what must be passing through the minds Qf&#xD;
her aunt and cousin, but her uncle's manner quick-&#xD;
ly re-assured her it was his home tQo&#xD;

rs. Winthrop and Laura were shown up-stairs,&#xD;
re the runks. had gone before them ; there was&#xD;
od dea1 of bustle and confusion everywhere&#xD;
ssarily attending the coiing of so important&#xD;
its. It was astonishing how.quickly Grace ar-&#xD;
ed little Mary in her holiday dress, and gave&#xD;
hair, which had such curling propensities,&#xD;
thing touch. Charles, Henry and. Arthu\&#xD;
* a due amount of coaxing, consented to come&#xD;

a difficult task of introducing them to their&#xD;
relati ns. Arthur and-Mary were quite will-&#xD;

age u  to the highest point, suddenly disap-&#xD;
ed as she opened the door to bring them in.&#xD;
only heard their suppressed .laughter as they&#xD;
led over each other in their haste to retreat.&#xD;
plainly saw she must bide her time to bring&#xD;
Syourig gentlemen into notice, and left them&#xD;
ijoy their outside posts.&#xD;
ter s.tting a few moments, Grace said in a low&#xD;
to Annie, "I. am going. to meet Ernest, but&#xD;

and added: "I wish you would take me to grand-&#xD;
mother's a fe~v moments. I will tell you by the&#xD;
way what my errand is."&#xD;
What Grace told her brother, or what her errand&#xD;
was at her grandmother's, we will not stay to hear.&#xD;
When tea was ready in the sitting-room, and Mrs.&#xD;
Winthrop began to fill the cups, she discovered&#xD;
her mother's hina was on the tray before her, and&#xD;
an unusual number of.silver spoons were at her&#xD;
service. She smiled to herself and remembered&#xD;
that Grace had been mis ing just when she wanted&#xD;
her, a little wiile before Ernest came home. She&#xD;
was sure she  ever would have thought of such a&#xD;
thing ; but Gdace had ways of her own, and if her&#xD;
grandmother sanctioned them, she should say noth.&#xD;
ing. Charles 4nd Henry had by degrees got within&#xD;
speaking dista ce of their uncle. Their curiosity&#xD;
to see .the horses led then into the. front yard,&#xD;
where they came suddenly upon him as he was&#xD;
giving some directions-to the coachman. Mrs.&#xD;
Winthrop and Laura were standing in .the front&#xD;
door, and Colonel Winthrop called the boys to&#xD;
come and speak to them ; finding a retreat impos..-&#xD;
sible, they cate forward, and now at the tea-table&#xD;
they were intensely interested in watching all that&#xD;
went on.&#xD;
"You know our errand, sister," said Colonel&#xD;
Winthrop. " did have some scruples about ask-&#xD;
ing so great i favor, but as I see all these young&#xD;
folks gathered round your table, I feel more bold&#xD;

throp; "even this tallow-candle seems to flicker al&#xD;
sort. of welcogie."&#xD;
After theiriguests had retired, Grace assisted her&#xD;
mother in some preparations for breakfast, and&#xD;
then had a little chat with Annie. She was anx-&#xD;
ious to know what impression her aunt and cousin)&#xD;
had made. Annie never made up her mind hastily.&#xD;
She liked them very well, especially Laura. She:&#xD;
wanted to. see more of her aunt before she could;&#xD;
tell what she thought of her. The next day was&#xD;
very beautiful. Colonel Winthrop spent the morn-&#xD;
ing in wand ring over familiar spots, and in the&#xD;
afternoon,, accompanied by his. wife and daughter,&#xD;
Ernest and Annie, he started for a ramble about&#xD;
the farm. Laura was delighted with the beautiful&#xD;
views. MrsJ Winthrop managed to get up all the&#xD;
interest she could, but she soon tired of walking&#xD;
and climbing stone fences. Ernest went back with&#xD;
her to a path which led to the house, and she came&#xD;
up to the porch and seated herself very gladly fobl&#xD;
a talk with little Mary, who was alone there play-&#xD;
ing with a pair of frolicksome kittens. .  n&#xD;
Mary was very much pleased with "the new&#xD;
lady," as she called her aunt. She grew very con-&#xD;
fiding and told her that she was goings to have&#xD;
some of the ''beautifulest" cake for tea that she ever&#xD;
saw. Grace was making it now, and she was "put-&#xD;
ting sugar all over the top;" then she thanked her&#xD;
for the pretty dress she sent her when.Grace went&#xD;
to Bostonandtold her items of household doings&#xD;
which greatly,amused her.&#xD;

Mrs. Colonel Winthrop was taking a new view,&#xD;
of life; it seemed to her so, impossible that this&#xD;
large family could go on so quietly without the aid&#xD;
of servants. She did not even see that their pres,&#xD;
ence caused extra labor. They helped each other,&#xD;
and everything seemed to go on so harmoniously.&#xD;
It was a new style of life, and its .novelty pleased'&#xD;
her.&#xD;
Just before sunset Colonel Winthrop appeared&#xD;
he had taken a different route from  rest and the&#xD;
girls.&#xD;
"I am more changed than the old arm," said he&#xD;
to his wife. ' I have had a sad enjoyment all the&#xD;
afternoon. I wonder I could be content to stay&#xD;
away from the _old place so long. .'Look at that&#xD;
sunset! it is just such as I used to witch from this&#xD;
very place. I can almost hear mother's voice call-&#xD;
ing me to do some forgotten thing. e boys liked'&#xD;
play, and mother's hands were ver busy at this&#xD;
hour." Again the boy stood in th man's place,.&#xD;
and Mrs. Winthrop was silent.&#xD;
Annie and Laura soon came. Ernest had left&#xD;
them at the gate and gone to attend to his evening&#xD;
tasks. Laural was glowing in her description of&#xD;
her ramble. Her mother called her attention to&#xD;
her torn dress as a testimony of some of the incon-&#xD;
veniences attending the. way.&#xD;
"Never mind that, mother ! the rock I climbed&#xD;
was worth more than my dress. I was the one;&#xD;
where father used to call the sheep to give them&#xD;
salt., The top of it is broad and flat like a table..&#xD;
To-morrow, Ernest is going to take us to ride in:&#xD;
the wagon. I shall enjoy that, I know."&#xD;

atl to Mary's delight, Doctor Allerton rode&#xD;
He did. not know of the arrival, but came iri&#xD;
as resented by Annie to her uncle, aunt and&#xD;
With his peculiarly happy manner, he&#xD;
sse  himself to Colonel Winthrop. He was&#xD;
ar ith Boston ; so he was at home with Col..&#xD;
Yin hrop there. He was well acquainted&#xD;
he  olitics of the day, and with the general&#xD;
sts Of the country, at home and abroad. The&#xD;
fib of conversation went on with an, ease&#xD;
leas re which made Ieacon Winthrop, who&#xD;
ome in, very glad that the new doctor hap-&#xD;
to all. When tea was ready, he rose to go,&#xD;
s .s cordially invited to stay, that he ac-&#xD;
th invitation .and prolonged his visit an&#xD;
fter yards ; then he excused himself, to see a&#xD;
at is a very intelligent young man," said&#xD;
l Winthrop to Ernest. "Do you expect to&#xD;
im in Beechford ?"&#xD;
hopp to. He is getting quite an extensive&#xD;
e, andi seems interested in his work. There&#xD;
ood many fine people in Beechford, uncle."&#xD;
now there must be. It was always a good.&#xD;
n. Only I have grown so accustomed to&#xD;
tle and activity of a city, that I forget. how&#xD;
here is in the quiet of the country. I have&#xD;
to think of the country as a place for rest."&#xD;
u had. better hire out to me next summer,"&#xD;
eacon. Winthrop, laughing heartily. "You&#xD;

father used to; but my recollection of toil and&#xD;
hardship is so much more in the army than on the&#xD;
farm, that I never think of farm life with any feel-&#xD;
ing but rest and enjoyment."&#xD;
''Not much rest," said Ernest; ' for nothing:&#xD;
stays as you leave it. The weeds and briars keep&#xD;
up a constant strife with the corn and otatoes, and&#xD;
in the garden the work is never done."&#xD;
" I have not come to the restingpla:e yet," said&#xD;
Deacon Winthrop; " but I suppose he world is&#xD;
alike all over ; it was intended to be 4 busy place,&#xD;
and, if we are good for any thing, we niust all have&#xD;
our share in its labors."&#xD;
By and by Col. Winthrop led the co versation to&#xD;
the subject of Grace's going home with them.&#xD;
" We shall not be content to go back without her,"&#xD;
said he, "unless there are positive obje tions to her&#xD;
going."&#xD;
"Don't you know, Brother Edward," said Mrs.&#xD;
Winthrop, "that she cannot dress as aura does,&#xD;
and that it would ,be impossible for her father to&#xD;
increase his expenses ?"&#xD;
"I. know it perfectly well; and, if I take her, it&#xD;
shall be at my own expense. Laura wants a com-&#xD;
panion. Her aunt is very anxious t have her,'&#xD;
and to me she will be a link from the old place."&#xD;
"How long do you mean to keep he ?"&#xD;
"I will not .promise to bring her back under a&#xD;
year, unless some of you are sick and really need&#xD;
her. I do not mean to rob you' of G ace, sister;&#xD;
though I would gladly .adopt her. Oily promise&#xD;
she may stay a year with us, and then be guided&#xD;
by circumstances afterward."&#xD;

olonel Winthrop found he had a good many&#xD;
acles to overcome from the whole family. The&#xD;
g lady herself did not help him much. She&#xD;
too happy at home, to seek to leave it. If her&#xD;
er and smother decided she had better remain,&#xD;
would be content. Laura was very earnest&#xD;
It it. She pictured in glowing colors the plea-&#xD;
s of the coming winter, and always spoke as&#xD;
going was a matter already decided.&#xD;
shall notgo directly home," said Colonel&#xD;
hrop. " I intend to journey until the first of&#xD;

Grace will have a fine opportunity. of see-&#xD;

acon and Mrs. Winthrop were a good deal&#xD;
exed. They thought about, talked about, and&#xD;

e, with her accustomed generosity, made no&#xD;

that ley another spring he should be able to&#xD;

said she. "I should think the young ladies here&#xD;
would enjoy his society.".&#xD;
"He does not seek ladies' society," said Ernest.&#xD;
" We have an idea that he has an interest outside&#xD;
of Beechford."&#xD;
"1 think the girls are a little afraid of him," said&#xD;
Grace. "He is always polite, but he seems so far&#xD;
off.''&#xD;
"That is your opinion," said Ernest. f'The&#xD;
truth is, Cousin Laura, Grace likes to have a good&#xD;
time, and manages to find plenty to jdin her.&#xD;
Here are Charlie Thorn and Edward      elson,&#xD;
always ready to do whatever she says, and he rest&#xD;
follow. Doctor Allerton strikes out his o n path.&#xD;
She regards him as quite too 'old and wise for her&#xD;
notice."&#xD;
Grace laughed, and said, "Ernest Winthrop had&#xD;
a path of his own as well as Doctor Allerton; at&#xD;
least the girls thought so. She was sure they&#xD;
could never manage him, if she was gone; but, for&#xD;
all that, he is one of the best brothers in the orld,"&#xD;
and she laid her head caressingly on his shoulder,&#xD;
and was half a mind not to go'away and leave him.&#xD;
Sunday, Deacon and Mrs. Winthrop rod in the&#xD;
carriage with their brother and sister, littl Mary&#xD;
accompanying them ; while Laura rode in the&#xD;
wagon with the family. Such an establishment&#xD;
had never come up to the village-green before, and&#xD;
we must not think it strange that many ey s were&#xD;
directed to it. Its owner was thinking  ore of&#xD;
the faces that were gone, and enjoying th shake&#xD;
of the' few friendly hands that were left t greet&#xD;
him, than of the sensation his carriage was making.&#xD;

s. Winthrop and Laura were watching the&#xD;
I scene with much interest,, and Grace  was&#xD;
ing h w cold and formal her uncle's, church&#xD;
ston was, compared with this dear home one.&#xD;
Deac n Winthrop always shrunk from dis-&#xD;
of any kind. Her own seat in the wagon&#xD;
d have been much more to her taste; but she&#xD;
ht it 'ardly polite to say so. She accepted&#xD;
3 as hey were. Mr. Wilson's discourse was&#xD;
hims excellent. Grace felt really home-&#xD;
s she ooked over the familiar scene from her&#xD;
the choir. The girls were full of regrets&#xD;
r going. They should miss her so much&#xD;
wher .&#xD;
remaining days of their stay, Grace was&#xD;
occupied in gathering together the treasures&#xD;
wardrobe and making farewell calls. Aunt&#xD;
as almost inconsolable, it was "such a poor&#xD;
or young girls to go away from home." She&#xD;
red "Mis' Winthrop" could consent to it.&#xD;
es," said Nannie, " but taint no use for us to&#xD;
word, Lois. Edward Winthrop was always&#xD;
having his own way when he was a' boy;&#xD;
thinks it's.a fine thing to take such a pretty,&#xD;
creature as. Grace to ride in his carriage and&#xD;
company with his daughter."&#xD;
at's it, Nannie. She is such a pretty creat-&#xD;
d every body takes toher so; that .I expect&#xD;
g but she'll be getting married out there to&#xD;
,and we shall never have her back again.&#xD;
ar ! I wish she had staid to home. She&#xD;

let her go !" And Aunt Lois wiped the te&#xD;
her poor old eyes, and tried to be resig&#xD;
what she could not help.&#xD;
"I don't believe she'll be sot up with&#xD;
tions," said Aunt Nannie.. "She's got a&#xD;
common sense, and that's worth more t&#xD;
pretty face and wonderful taking ways.&#xD;
a good bringing up, and the Lord will tak(&#xD;
her wherever she goes. May be He'll b&#xD;
back to us."&#xD;
So they comforted each other, and- tri&#xD;
cheerful over the loss of their favorite.&#xD;
Colonel Winthrop had called on them,&#xD;
a substantial proof of his early recoliectior&#xD;
Mi-s. Winthrop had been entertained&#xD;
quaint ways and curious little cottage, ar&#xD;
had become quite familiar with the' "all&#xD;
and their blooming contents. She had&#xD;
the big bunches of fennel which they g&#xD;
and quite won Aunt Lois's good opinion&#xD;
ing one of her sage beds as nicely as s&#xD;
have done it herself.&#xD;
If they had not been determined to car&#xD;
off, the old ladies would have considered&#xD;
wonderful nice family-not a bit "stuck&#xD;
their fine things.&#xD;
Laura took them to ride in her father's&#xD;
Annie accompanying her. This time the&#xD;
were left at home, as Grace told them the&#xD;
not need them' at all. So, leaving out the&#xD;
they enjoyed the visit.&#xD;

FIFTY YEARS AGO.           159&#xD;
Aft r di ner Sandford Ross and Annie, Ernest,&#xD;
Julia  hor and Laura went to the lake, which lay&#xD;
about four miles distant.&#xD;
Charlie horn had invited Grace,. but she was&#xD;
oblige d to excuse herself, because she had so much&#xD;
to do, and she -must go to bid her grandfather and&#xD;
grandmother good-bye. Her mother was going&#xD;
out to ride with her uncle and aunt; Arthur and&#xD;
Mary were to go with them to have their last ride&#xD;
in the carriage.&#xD;
She wen alone to her grandfather's and staid&#xD;
with the ol people to an early tea.&#xD;
"Remember, my child !" said her grandmother,&#xD;
at par ing, ' your Bible and your prayers. I may&#xD;
be go e w en you come again, but I would have&#xD;
this t oug t abide with you always. Unless you&#xD;
love tM Lord Jesus Christ and serve Him above every-&#xD;
thing ise, our life will be a failure.  May He&#xD;
'keep you from temptation and deliver you from&#xD;
evil.'"&#xD;
" Ycur grandmother's words are good, my child,"&#xD;
said her grandfather; "and I will add to them,&#xD;
'Be not wise in thine own eyes ; fear the Lord and&#xD;
depar from evil,' and 'the Lord shall guide thee&#xD;
contin ally. "-&#xD;
Grace was weeping now, and with one, more&#xD;
farewell from these faithful sentinels of 'her child-&#xD;
hood and youth, she. went on her way. Once she&#xD;
turned back to look, and there they stood. watch-&#xD;
ing her out of sight.&#xD;
There were two ways home--one by the usual&#xD;
road, and an other more retired, where they walked&#xD;
or rode on horseback ; it was once the highway, but&#xD;
&#xD;

I64           FIFTY YEARS AGO.&#xD;
had been so ittle used since the shorter road was&#xD;
made that it had growh impassable for wheels.&#xD;
She chose this latter path, that she might have&#xD;
time to compose herself without much  anger of&#xD;
meeting anybody. She had gone about half-way,&#xD;
-and was trying to look at the bright side of things,&#xD;
determining that her last evening at home should&#xD;
be a cheerful one, when the was aroused by the&#xD;
sound of horse's feet coming in the path behind&#xD;
her. Who could it be? Her first impulse was to&#xD;
wait behind a tree until the rider passed, but be-&#xD;
fore she had time to get out of sight the horse was&#xD;
beside her and its rider had dismounted.&#xD;
Her eyes were so swollen and so red from the&#xD;
tears she had.. been shedding that she di not look&#xD;
up until a pleasant voice said, "Is it possible that I&#xD;
find you here, Miss Grace ?"&#xD;
"Doctor Allerton !" said she, in equal astonish-&#xD;
ment, "who would have thought of meeting you&#xD;
here?  I did not lknow that you ever ame this&#xD;
way."&#xD;
"I have learned all the traveled path of your&#xD;
town. I was going to your house, and, for con-&#xD;
venience, came across here. Most fortunately, I&#xD;
think, since I have overtaken you in it. Is it"&#xD;
really true, Miss Grace,. that you are going to&#xD;
leave us ?'.&#xD;
" I suppose so. I have just been to bid grand-&#xD;
father and grandmother good-bye, I did not think'&#xD;
it would be so hard to leave them." .&#xD;
"And are they the only ones you regret to&#xD;
leave-?"&#xD;
" Oh, no ! I -have so: many friends that I won-&#xD;
&#xD;
FIFTY YEARS AGO.&#xD;
&#xD;
der I can go at all." And she choked back the&#xD;
tears that were ready to start again.&#xD;
"Did it ever!occur-to you," said her companion,&#xD;
gently detaining her, "that anybody outside of&#xD;
your imr mediate home circle might deeply regret&#xD;
your uncle's invitation ?."&#xD;
"Yes, the girls all do. It has been a great trial&#xD;
to part with them."&#xD;
"Grace Winthrop !" said Doctor Allerton, tak-&#xD;
ing her hand, "you must pardon my abruptness,&#xD;
and, listen while I tell.you something which, but&#xD;
for your going I should have kept longer to tmyselt&#xD;
and revealed at a moie fitting time. I hoped, as&#xD;
we saw more of each other, you would understand&#xD;
my feelings towards you, for I have learned to love&#xD;
you very much, and to hope that sometime in the&#xD;
future yo will return my love, and-consent to be-&#xD;
come my wife."&#xD;
Had any earthquake uddenly rent the ground at&#xD;
the young girl's feet, she could not have been more&#xD;
utterly astonished. S e had been so full of happi-&#xD;
ness, had had so many to love,.and so much to inter-&#xD;
est and occupy her, th t she had had little room&#xD;
to dream of what mig t be. When she got to it,&#xD;
possibly she might marry, but not for years and&#xD;
years.i She was not uite eighteen, only a dear,&#xD;
home child, and Doctor Allerton, of all persons,&#xD;
to ask her to become  is wife! He was so Much&#xD;
older and so much wiser that, she never thought&#xD;
he self a companion for him. What could have&#xD;
pu such a thought intc his head! Had she heard&#xD;
aright ? Yes, she had, or it was very plainly said,&#xD;
and here stood Docto} Allerton still holding her&#xD;

hand, and looking with such an intense ex&#xD;
in his speaking eyes.&#xD;
Hastily withdrawing her hand, she coy&#xD;
face, and wept. The tears she had' just p&#xD;
all came again. It seemed to'her that th&#xD;
had grown strangely dark, and she was&#xD;
trouble. Her impulse was to run away, an&#xD;
believe she had heard a word of what Do&#xD;
lerton certainly said. But in the apparent&#xD;
posed man, who had turned away to let&#xD;
cover herself, she felt that she had met a r&#xD;
In a little time he came to her, and sal&#xD;
quietly, "We must not wait here, Miss&#xD;
the dew is heavy, and however much 1 mi&#xD;
to detain you, I should not like to have&#xD;
sick."&#xD;
Drawing his horse's bridle over one&#xD;
placed her hand in the other and they&#xD;
slowly on.&#xD;
" I must consider this meeting provid&#xD;
said he, breaking the silence. "Ever since&#xD;
you were going, I have been seeking an&#xD;
tunity to speak to you on this subject. I&#xD;
despaired of obtaining it, when I found you&#xD;

Once Grace.would have said this was her&#xD;
for choosing it this afternoon, but she seem&#xD;
denly bereft of the power of speech.&#xD;

Withdrawing her hand from  i1s arm,&#xD;
soon out of sight, and going through the&#xD;
she entered a back door and went up to h&#xD;
The others had not yet come, and the h&#xD;
very still. It seemed to her as if a shad&#xD;
fallen over everything. She loinged to&#xD;
door and weep until it passed away.&#xD;
there was the cheerful voice of C arles, ca&#xD;
from the foot of the stairs.  He had a i&#xD;

It was her last night at home or a lo&#xD;
and she'had intended to have everything r&#xD;
tea as soon as-they came from their ride.&#xD;
bad enough parting with her grandfather an&#xD;
mother, how could Doctor Allerton add&#xD;
trouble by such an unheard of, proposition&#xD;
his wife! or anybody's wife ! And a whiol&#xD;
regrets for her lost child-life again came&#xD;
over her. Now she was glad she was goi&#xD;
to-morrow ; she should forget it n the ch&#xD;
scene, and when she came back it would b&#xD;
never happened. Charles' second . call rou&#xD;

in spite of herself, and by the time the&#xD;
came she was tolerablT composed. If her&#xD;

I wanted to see you young doctor again," said&#xD;
Colonel Winthrop. "I thought he might happen&#xD;
in to tea."&#xD;
"I did not know but e might be here when we&#xD;
got home," said Mrs. W nthrop,-"has he been here&#xD;
this afternoon, Charles ?"&#xD;
Charles having been left ii capacity of liouse-&#xD;
keeper, quickly responded.  No, ma'am, and&#xD;
Mrs. Winthrop surmise that he would probably&#xD;
call in the evening.&#xD;
Grace felt the blood rush to her face at the very&#xD;
mention of his' name.  he turned to speak to her&#xD;
little sister, though she scarcely knew what she&#xD;
asked her. Mary was a good covert, for she was&#xD;
too frill of the grandeur of her ride in ",that beau-&#xD;
tiful carriage," to hear a word her sister said.&#xD;
Doctor Allerton did call at evening, and was&#xD;
to all appearance quite absorbed in conversation&#xD;
with their guests. Several of Grace's most inti-&#xD;
mate friends came too. So she had enough to do&#xD;
to talk to them all. S-e did not once speak to&#xD;
Doctor Allerton, but sh felt 'his- presence every-&#xD;
where. She was more grave than usual, but that&#xD;
was easily accounted for in the jct that she, was&#xD;
leaving so much that she loved. To have a some-&#xD;
thing in her keeping which she could not even tell her&#xD;
life-long confidant Julia Thorn, was oppressive, some.&#xD;
thing which she could no: speak of even; to Ernest,&#xD;
required new strength on her part to carry alone.&#xD;
She hoped to avoid speaking to Doctor Allerton&#xD;
vvhen he left. Seeming, to. be absorbed with last&#xD;
words to her young friends, she tried not to notice&#xD;
his-going. But he advanced 1o the corer where,&#xD;

thinking over her perplexities, until she was too&#xD;
weary to think any. longer, she forgot them all,&#xD;
and- did not wake until the, sun was shadowing the&#xD;
elm leaves all over her window curtain.&#xD;
Things look to us so differently by daylight, es-&#xD;
pecially when there is something to'fill out every&#xD;
moment of our time, even her interview with Doc-&#xD;
tor Allerton involved less than her midnight view&#xD;
of it presented. She had only promised to answer&#xD;
his letters. After all he might not write.. If he&#xD;
did he would soon tire of it, and she should not&#xD;
have to see him again until she had forgotten what&#xD;
he said. She went down stairs, determining to be&#xD;
very cheerful, and assist as usual in the breakfast&#xD;
duties, but Charles had entered the service before&#xD;
her.&#xD;
"Mother says'I must try and fill your place,"&#xD;
said he; " but should not wonder if I should be&#xD;
missing a good .many times this winter just when&#xD;
she wants the table set, boys are so unrelia le, you&#xD;
know," and he gave his sister a wise, comprehen-&#xD;
sive nod. "I suppose she will not expect me to&#xD;
sew, and do all the family things you do. I won-&#xD;
der what sort of a cap I should make for grand-&#xD;
mother, or how Annie would like the way I should&#xD;
trim her winter bonnet." So the lively boy chat-&#xD;
ted on, until breakfast was ready, his mother clecid-&#xD;
ing that in one thing at least, he could equal Grace,&#xD;
and that was talking.&#xD;
They were to start in the morning, the carriage&#xD;
was at the gate, the horses in their silver-decked&#xD;
harnesses seemed impatient to be gone. Colonel&#xD;

CHAPTER- XIII.&#xD;
THE JOURNEY.&#xD;
rP.HE journey to New York had variety in scen-&#xD;
ery and in people. Sometimes when Laura&#xD;
and Grice were tired of riding, they walked for a&#xD;
mile, stoppino- to admire the fine views. Every-&#xD;
thing was different from the journey which Ernest&#xD;
and Grace took the year before, no wayside din-&#xD;
ners or friendly cou ins were in this.&#xD;
Colonel Winthrok .never went beyond a certain&#xD;
degree of familiarity, and his excessive punctuality&#xD;
made no allowances for any waiting on the part of&#xD;
his family. Mrs. Winthrop often said she had to&#xD;
live half an hour ahead to keep time with her. htis&#xD;
band, and Laura was fast learning this half hour&#xD;
principle. Grace did not anticipate much trouble&#xD;
from this point in her uncle's character, she had-&#xD;
never been in the habit of k eping people waiting.&#xD;
At length they reached N, w York. New York&#xD;
fifty years ago! .Where are the hotels and places&#xD;
of note to-day, which were so conspicuous then?&#xD;
Where are the old forest rees that were then&#xD;
strong undisputed possessors of even the "down&#xD;
town" of to-day ? Who could have foretold that the&#xD;
on-marching tide of life and ctivity would in fifty&#xD;

years uproot them all, and plant in their places&#xD;
broad 'venues and princely d ellings, with the&#xD;
ever-ircreasing' demand for "more room, more&#xD;
room." Well! New York met all the necessities&#xD;
of the country then and it on y doe's that now.&#xD;
Probably in another fifty years he wonder will be&#xD;
how we ever called it "'a gre t city." Colonel.&#xD;
Winthrop knew where to find he best accommo-&#xD;
dations the city afforded, and having established&#xD;
his family quite to his mind, he left them to enjoy&#xD;
themselves for the rest of the da in their own .way.&#xD;
Grac's perceptive faculties vere on the alert&#xD;
now, for everything was strange and new. She&#xD;
felt more lonely than she had one since leaving&#xD;
home, and was glad when she a d Laura could go&#xD;
to their room and be themselves again. Her trunk&#xD;
looked like an old friend. She pened and shut it&#xD;
with special satisfaction, and almost felt like pat-&#xD;
ting its unpretending surface.&#xD;
" Cone, Grace," said Laura, "you have done all&#xD;
homage to that trunk. I wish  o'h would leave it&#xD;
and sit in this window with  e and look at the&#xD;
people and the fashions; that's t e way when you'&#xD;
come to New York."&#xD;
Grac  looked on and was    oon entertaining&#xD;
Laura. ith her original remarks as the' morning&#xD;
picture came under her eye.&#xD;
" We are going on a shopping expedition to-&#xD;
morrow,'' said her cousin; " ait until you see&#xD;
yoursel arrayed in  ome of m ther's purchases,&#xD;
and then no more smiling at th 'fashions from my&#xD;
lady! Don't look sober, now; mother has good&#xD;
taste, not at all inclining to the r diculous."&#xD;

It was as Laura said ; the,&#xD;

&#xD;
after, dinner was announced. Robert-Oakley, the&#xD;
eldest, escorted Laura, and his brother gave his&#xD;
arm to Grace. Conversation at the table was easy&#xD;
and general, but there was so much.ceremony that&#xD;
Grace was glad. she had taken some lessons at her&#xD;
uncle's table, or with all her powers of quick ob-&#xD;
servation, she. could hardly have failed to have felt&#xD;
herself in a trying' position. She was glad when&#xD;
after sitting two full hours, the ladies, rose and left&#xD;
the table. Then Laura and she wandered about&#xD;
the rooms looking at some old paintings, which&#xD;
Laura explained to.her and made them tell a story&#xD;
of their own. Then came some music, to "which&#xD;
Grace listened with great delight, and soon the&#xD;
gentlemen joined them. Robert Oakley came and&#xD;
stood by her; and very naturally fell into conversa-&#xD;
tion with her. Grace was never at loss for lan-&#xD;
guage; she only needed somebody to draw her&#xD;
out. She had seen so many of the noted things.of&#xD;
the city that they had plenty to talk about. And&#xD;
Boston, which he had left .only a few years before,&#xD;
afforded. an ample topic,; by-and-by Laura came,&#xD;
and James Oakley and two or three others, And in&#xD;
the general conversation which followed, Grace&#xD;
was a' silent, but appreciating listener. She had'&#xD;
forgotten herself long ago. She did not know that&#xD;
the secret of her success wherever she went was&#xD;
her gift' of forgetting herself and enjoying other people.&#xD;
She had scarcely thought how she appeared since&#xD;
she came; there was so much to'entertain and in-&#xD;
'terest her that she had no time for it.&#xD;
Robert and James Oakley were old acquaint-&#xD;

revive-some of them very amusing and quite en.&#xD;
joyable to live over again. Mrs. Oakley was talking&#xD;
with Mrs. Winthrop, but her eye often wandered&#xD;
to the merry group where her sons vere.&#xD;
"I have a very happy thought, Mrs. Winthrop,"&#xD;
said she. " I wish you would leave these two young&#xD;
ladies with me a couple of months. I think I could&#xD;
make it very pleasant for them."&#xD;
" Thank you," replied Mrs. Wint rop. "I have&#xD;
no doubt of the pleasure they would have, but Colo-&#xD;
nel Winthrop would not consent to that; heis fond&#xD;
of having young people in the house. Laura has&#xD;
been away at school a great deal, and his niece is&#xD;
a prize too hard to obtain to part with so soon."&#xD;
" I am afraid you are making-Colonel Winthrop&#xD;
your shield," said Mrs. Oakley, laughing. "Will&#xD;
you consent to it if he does ?";&#xD;
"I am so sure that he will not, that it is quite&#xD;
safe to say yes."&#xD;
"Here he comes " said Mrs. Oakley. "I will&#xD;
see what his unbiassed opinion is.  o you know,&#xD;
colonel, that I am strongly dispose to keep these&#xD;
young ladies for a couple of months, and giVe them&#xD;
some idea of New Y rk ? You Bostonians are not&#xD;
half aware of our superior advantages."&#xD;
"Don't forget that you are a Bostonian yourself,&#xD;
Mrs. Oakley !"&#xD;
I'll promise not to, if you will leave these girls&#xD;
with me ; it is just he season for enjoyment, and&#xD;
I shall be most happy to chaperone them."&#xD;
" You are certain1j very kind, and if they could&#xD;
be in two places, I should be disposed to accept&#xD;
your invitation, but it will be impossible to leave&#xD;
&#xD;
'77&#xD;
&#xD;
them now, our journey is not yet. completed.- I&#xD;
propose to start for Philadelphia to-morrow."&#xD;
"Oh, you had not told us that !" said Mrs. Oak-&#xD;
ley; "then you can leave them on your return."&#xD;
"Thank you; it will be impossible. I like young&#xD;
people in the house in the winter."&#xD;
Mrs. Oakley understood Colonel Winthrop's "im-&#xD;
possible " so well, that she did not press the sub-&#xD;
ject any farther, and shortly after her guests took&#xD;
their leave.&#xD;
On their way home Laura asked her father "if&#xD;
their going to:Philadelphia was not sudden."&#xD;
".No," said h ; "I thought of it before we came&#xD;
from home. I did not tell your mother until we&#xD;
got to New York, for my mind was not fully made&#xD;
up. I did not like to drive my horses on so long&#xD;
a journey, and unless I could hire a pair that suited&#xD;
me, and leave mine in good care to rest, I did not&#xD;
expect to go. I have found a pair to-day,-.and a&#xD;
driver, so I shall leave John to take care of mine,&#xD;
and they will be fresh for starting when we come&#xD;
back. I suppose you and Grace will not object to&#xD;
seeing a little more of the world, even if the an-&#xD;
nouncement was sudden."&#xD;
"I shall enjoy it doubly for having Grace, and I&#xD;
have long been wanting to go to.Philadelphia."&#xD;
"New York and Philadelphia !" thought Grace,&#xD;
as she leaned back. in the carriage and thought.&#xD;
"I suppose Iram Grace Winthrop, but I almost doubt&#xD;
it." The poor girl had had a succession of  doubts&#xD;
ever since she .met. Doctor Allerton on her way&#xD;
home from hex grandfather's. The rapid succes-&#xD;

her thoughts from the scene, but now and then it&#xD;
came up very forcibly. On reaching the hotel the&#xD;
girls went directly to their room, and after laying&#xD;
aside their. shawls, they sat down to talk.&#xD;
"Were you not surprised to hear we were going&#xD;
to Philadelphia to-morrow ?" asked Grace.&#xD;
"Yes ; but father likes to surprise us by some&#xD;
plan he thinks out and expects us to enjoy. It is&#xD;
very pleasant this time, surely. You don't know&#xD;
how much more I enjoy this journey for having&#xD;
you along ; I am always so lonely in my room at a&#xD;
hotel. I even enjoy d the dinner at Mrs. Oakley's&#xD;
to-day better for hating you there. I was think-&#xD;
ing when you sat so quietly dignified at the table,&#xD;
how thoroughly yo'9 were taking in every thing&#xD;
around you. What a happy thought it was for&#xD;
you to come to Boston ! It will be such a pleasure&#xD;
to me this winter to have some one to enjoy things&#xD;
with me. I know now how lonely I have been.&#xD;
I felt it more when I saw how much you all loved&#xD;
each other at your house, and how many ways you&#xD;
had of being happy without riches. But I am run-&#xD;
ning on about myself, without asking you how you&#xD;
like New York dinner-parties."&#xD;
"I got through this one a great deal better than&#xD;
I expected to. I was so entertained with the&#xD;
novelty that I forget to be embarrassed. I .never&#xD;
once thought about my ncw silk dress."&#xD;
"I thought you did not," said Laura, .smiling.&#xD;
"Iow did you like Mrs. Oakley's proposal ?"&#xD;
"I had better reply by.asking how you'liked it,&#xD;
for I am so bewildered with New York, Philadel.&#xD;
phia and Boston, that Iyam sure I cannot' tell."&#xD;

"I knew father would not listed. to it; in the first&#xD;
place, he would not leave us anywhere ;- and in the&#xD;
next place, he does not like Robert Oakley. ,It is one&#xD;
of his unaccountable dislikes. When they lived in&#xD;
Boston he fancied he was too attentive to his daugh-&#xD;
ter. We were very young, and father seemed pos-&#xD;
sessed with the idea that I should be snatched away&#xD;
from him before he was ready to let me .go. He&#xD;
and mother are great friends. of Mr.. and Mrs.&#xD;
Oakley, and he never speaks-of Robert now. I&#xD;
think he is convinced that there was nothing more&#xD;
than friendship between us ; but you may be sure&#xD;
he will not leave us to. visit with, Mrs. Oakley.&#xD;
Mother told re to come to her - room," said&#xD;
she, suddenly starting up. "Be sure you do&#xD;
not run away if I leave you alone a 'few mo.&#xD;
ments."&#xD;
Mrs. Winthyop was lying down after the fatigues&#xD;
of the day.  he only wished to.tell,Laura to send&#xD;
everything to her room that she and Grace could&#xD;
do without on their trip to Philadelphia, as her&#xD;
father desired as little baggage as possible, and to&#xD;
tell her that she should not go down tothe parlor&#xD;
again this evening ; so, of course, she. and Grace&#xD;
need not.&#xD;
"Crace may. send her black silk dress- to my&#xD;
room, she will not need it while we are gone.&#xD;
And, by the way, Laura, I was more than satisfied&#xD;
with her to-d y, she did not make a single blunder,&#xD;
and that dress is particularly becoming. Mrs. Oak-&#xD;

the morning. Your father says we must leave by&#xD;
ten o'clock."&#xD;
Punctually at ten o'clock Colonel Winthrop's&#xD;
carriage, with its new horses. and driver, stood at&#xD;
the door of their hotel, and his family were soon&#xD;
in it driving towards Philadelphia.&#xD;
It was now the second week in October, the&#xD;
weather was fine, an 1 in due time, by easy stages,&#xD;
they reached Philadelphia.&#xD;
" What a contrast to Boston !" said Laura, as&#xD;
they, drove through its regular streets. "I am so&#xD;
used to going crooked at home, that I really be-&#xD;
lieve I should lose myself in this-good order."&#xD;
Here, as in New York, Grace gathered up every&#xD;
thing of interest.&#xD;
"How shall I ever keep so much to tell them at&#xD;
home," sai she to Laura one day; "letters are so&#xD;
poor to cairy the half I have to tell."&#xD;
"You must see the old State House, where that&#xD;
glorious Declaration was read," said. Colonel Win-.&#xD;
throp the first morni g after their arrival; and to&#xD;
the State House tlhey went. They visited the&#xD;
library which Franklin's public spirit founded ; the&#xD;
Athenaum, the Academy of Fine Arts, and- he&#xD;
United States Mint.&#xD;
Colonel Winthrop was intensely national; he&#xD;
looked upon these foundations of future improve-&#xD;
ment, as foretastes of the country's growth in peace&#xD;
and prosperity. In its days of darkness and peril&#xD;
he had fought for its welfare, and now its omens&#xD;
of future life and g eatness filled him with rejoic-&#xD;
ing. He had not b en so far south since weary,&#xD;

"What an expression,, Grace ! I have been&#xD;
watching your face ; it has a look of sad intensity&#xD;
which I never saw ybu wear before. Do smile, or&#xD;
I shall think my sun1y cousin has a shadow some-&#xD;
where."&#xD;
Grace did smile, end drop the thought which&#xD;
Laura's remark had brought to light.&#xD;
Just then Mrs. Winthrop came in to tell Laura&#xD;
her father thought that she had made so many&#xD;
purchases, that it wpuld be necessary to get an&#xD;
extra trunk for packing, and send it by the mail-&#xD;
coach to Boston.&#xD;
" So you must send all that you and Grace can&#xD;
do without to my room as soon as possible."&#xD;
While Laura was packing, Grace wrote to An-&#xD;
nie. She had only sent one letter home since she&#xD;
left, and had not heard a word from them.. She&#xD;
expected to find a letter waiting for her when she&#xD;
reached Boston. The horses were fresh and strong&#xD;
to undertake the journey, and.John had them in&#xD;
readiness for their homeward trip the next morn-&#xD;
ing at an early hour.&#xD;
November is fitful, and if she beams softly through&#xD;
hazy vapors on her "opening days," she may sweep&#xD;
away every vestige of such moods in one of her&#xD;
gustful attacks. Colonel Winthrop made no un-'&#xD;
necessary delays, driving as far each day as he&#xD;
could, with safety to the horses. Two or three&#xD;
days of rain were the only interruptions they&#xD;
had.&#xD;
About'the middle of the month, one windy day,&#xD;
Grace found herself in front of the same stately&#xD;
mansion which she so well remembered 'to have&#xD;

184.          FIFTY YEARS AGO.&#xD;
Doctor Allerton looked less iormidable than he had&#xD;
ever done before, and for the first time she thought&#xD;
of his letters as a source of unexpected pleasure.&#xD;
Her heart was aching to ask if there were any letters&#xD;
waiting for her; but there was so much bustle and&#xD;
inquiry after this and that, that she did not venture&#xD;
to mention it.&#xD;
" I am tired and hungry," said Laura, coming in&#xD;
from a general survey of the house, and throwing&#xD;
herself on the bed. "After dinner 1 expect to&#xD;
sleep until to-morrow morning, if I can, and then&#xD;
we will begin housekeeping. Such a cleaning of&#xD;
drawers and closets as I expect to make ! You.&#xD;
shall have your share of'all the conyniences,' as&#xD;
Mrs. Clark says.&#xD;
" Do you keep a fire here all of the time ?"&#xD;
"Yes, always.. Ralph fills that box :wice every&#xD;
day, and Mrs. Clark looks after the fire when I am&#xD;
out. This fire has been my special companion. I&#xD;
shall not be on half as social terms with it, now that&#xD;
I have you to talk to. .I'm so glad to see you sit-&#xD;
ting in that chair, Grace Winthrop, that I do not&#xD;
believe I shall ever let you go away. Come to&#xD;
this window," said she, rising up and going to it.&#xD;
"See what a beautiful view we have ! I have&#xD;
watched all of these surroundings so ong, that I&#xD;
feel as if they were my especial friends.'&#xD;
It was rather a chill November day, and people&#xD;
w ere hurrying along as if increased  peed were&#xD;
necessary to keep up a brisk circulation. Grace&#xD;
tried to think how it would look under a sunny&#xD;
sky, and Laura was satisfied that she would admire.&#xD;
it sufficiently by and by.,&#xD;
&#xD;
FIFTY YEARS AGO.&#xD;
&#xD;
There was a knock at the door, and Mrs. Clark&#xD;
appeared, holding up a letter. "It came for you&#xD;
three days ago Miss Grace. I forgot to give it:to&#xD;
you as soon a you got here, though I kept it by&#xD;
itself on purpose."&#xD;
"A letter !" and Grace's face lit up so beamingly&#xD;
that Laura called it very beautiful.&#xD;
"Oh! thank you, Mrs. Clark. It is the very&#xD;
thing I wanted.. Annie !" she exclaimed, and dance&#xD;
round the room in very joy.&#xD;
"Good-bye," said Laura. "Don't fly out of th&#xD;
window and go to Beechford, while I am gone,'&#xD;
and in a moment Grace was alone. She opened&#xD;
the dear letter and read, and-read, and laughed,&#xD;
and cried. It was the first sound from home for&#xD;
six weeks. There were messages from, every one&#xD;
of them,.and little items of news. They had missed&#xD;
her so much! Mother had no idea of how many&#xD;
steps she saved her.' Ernest said the house was&#xD;
lonely from top to bottom, and the children were&#xD;
always in trouble about -something which would&#xD;
not be so if-Grace were here. "Father and I make&#xD;
the best of it," wrote Annie. "If we did not, I&#xD;
think you would see the whole family, with Aunt&#xD;
Nannie and. Aunt Lois, in close pursuit of you.&#xD;
Aunt Lois says, 'It's a-foolish piece of business to&#xD;
let young gals go off with their fine relations, but&#xD;
folks must do as they are a-mind to with their&#xD;
own.' Mother says, 'Remember your uncle's kind-.&#xD;
ness, and repay him by your dutiful attention to&#xD;
his wishes.'&#xD;
" Can I stay away a whole year!" said she, half&#xD;
aloud. 'Why did I come ?" Then the thought&#xD;

CHAPTER            XIV.&#xD;
THE NEW HOME.&#xD;
HEN Grace opened her eyes the next morn-.&#xD;
te fing, Mrs. Clark had been in and lighted&#xD;
the fire. Sl ei had thrown open the blinds and let&#xD;
the sun in through the curtains. The room had a&#xD;
very cheerful aspect, and there, in the corner, was&#xD;
. her trunk, the most attractive thing on which her&#xD;
eye rested. She got up quietly, not intending to&#xD;
waken Laura, but in a few moments she sprang. up,&#xD;
exclaiming, "Grace! where are you? I was just&#xD;
dreaming that I got up and could not find you any-&#xD;
where. Father and mother were looking and call-&#xD;
ing, and finally somebody told us that Annie sent&#xD;
for you in that letter, and you had gone home. I&#xD;
was so grieved and indignant that it woke me, and&#xD;
when I saw your place empty, I did not know but&#xD;
you had gone."&#xD;
"No, I anm not quite so uncertain in my move-&#xD;
ments as th t," said Grace; "I shall take daylight,&#xD;
when I run away."&#xD;
" When did Mrs. Clark open these blinds? That&#xD;
is always  y signal for rising. I do not suppose&#xD;
breakfast w 11 be one minute later, for all the long&#xD;
ride we have taken. I have no doubt father has&#xD;

been out on horseback a full hour this morning I&#xD;
don't believe he was ever tired in his life."&#xD;
" I was wondering how you ever knew wh n it&#xD;
was time to get up. At home, the children are&#xD;
always awake so early that I depend on them."&#xD;
"You, will find Mrs. Clark equal to a host of chil-&#xD;
dren. She never gives me any peace when she&#xD;
thinks it really time for me to get up. She always&#xD;
.lets in the sun as soon as the fire is kindled."&#xD;
As soon as the girls had completed their morn-&#xD;
ing toilette, Laura proposed they should go down&#xD;
stairs. "Father always comes into the back parlor,&#xD;
after his ride, and he .considers it a great omission&#xD;
if I am not there."&#xD;
Colonel Winthrop looked quite satisfied when&#xD;
he saw the two girls waiting to receive his good-&#xD;
morning. The keen, frosty air had given a glow&#xD;
of health and cheerfulness to his face, and his smile&#xD;
was most gracious as he remarked on the benefits&#xD;
of the morning air. "If you want to keep young&#xD;
and vigorous," said he, "never lie in bed in the&#xD;
morning."&#xD;
Grace remembered that she had always been ac-&#xD;
quainted with this same morning air, and she&#xD;
thoughtof it at that moment reddening the cheeks&#xD;
of her young, healthy brothers as they were about&#xD;
their morning tasks.&#xD;
When Mrs. Winthrop came-down, breakfast was&#xD;
served, the coffee came steaming from a massive&#xD;
silver urn, and Grace was again reminded of her&#xD;
last year's admiration for the beautiful table service..&#xD;
She thought of it in contrast to their own at home,&#xD;
but affection so gilded that plain,.unmatched set&#xD;
&#xD;
FIFTY YEARS -AGO.     .    89&#xD;
in daily use there, that it did not lose one particle&#xD;
of its dignity in her estimation.&#xD;
CoJonel Winthrop never made haste over break-&#xD;
fast, dinner o tea; his time was. so much at his&#xD;
disposal that he could arrange its expenditure to&#xD;
suit his own convenience.  Grace. was. so much&#xD;
accustomed to dispatch, particularl-y in the morn-&#xD;
ing, that she could hardly feel content to sit so&#xD;
long only for breakfast.&#xD;
This ended, Laura sat down to hear how the&#xD;
piano sounded after its long silence. Grace was a&#xD;
very ready listener; but Laura, after playing a few&#xD;
times, said, ." Come, Grace, we must proceed to&#xD;
business. . Don't expect to see us again until din-&#xD;
ner, mother," said she, as she went gaily up-stairs.&#xD;
"Unless I tell you that'my trunk from New York&#xD;
has arrived, and you want some of the things that&#xD;
are in it."&#xD;
'-' That, of course, might induce us out of our&#xD;
retreat.  ut has it come ?"&#xD;
"Yes, it as here before we were, but you must&#xD;
not come down at present. I 'am too tired to open&#xD;
it. I am going to get rested before I do any--&#xD;
thing."&#xD;
Mrs. Clark :had put the room in oruer while the&#xD;
young ladies were down -stairs. Two easy- chairs&#xD;
were drawn cozily up before the fire, and the&#xD;
whole room had a most inviting aspect..&#xD;
" No use for easy -chairs this morning," said&#xD;
Laura. "We must get ready to live first."&#xD;
It did, indeed, prove a very busy morning.&#xD;
Bureau drawers were emptied and re-arranged,&#xD;
and plenty of room made .for Grace... Summer&#xD;

&#xD;
apparel was packed away and winter things un-&#xD;
packed and brought out. Grace had no longer any&#xD;
use for her. trunk, so she regretfully saw it put away&#xD;
ip a store-room in the attic.&#xD;
At last, everything had a place-the easy-chairs&#xD;
were one at each window, a table standing between&#xD;
them. Laura had produced a' basket well sup-&#xD;
plied with sewing materials, which she placed on&#xD;
Grace's side of the table.&#xD;
"You see I knew the habits of your busy&#xD;
fingers," said she, "and here is amusement for&#xD;
them."&#xD;
The morning had gone so fast, that, before they&#xD;
knew it, dinner-time came.&#xD;
Grace had read over her letter from home, but&#xD;
she had been so interested in her busy morning&#xD;
that she had not felt the dreadful homesick feeling&#xD;
which so troubled her the afternoon before.&#xD;
At dinner, Colonel Winthrop said the horses&#xD;
were too tired to go out to-day, so they would dis-&#xD;
pense with their ride if Mrs. Winthrop felt so dis-&#xD;
posed.&#xD;
" I am too tired myself," said she. "I feel as if&#xD;
I had had riding enough to last for a long time,&#xD;
and shall esteem it quite a privilege to stay in the&#xD;
house. The girls can walk if they reed exer-&#xD;
cise."&#xD;
"We are something like you, mother too tired.&#xD;
to need.it. -.Besides, we have seen so much lately,&#xD;
we prefer quiet and rest for a day or two."&#xD;
After dinner, the girls went with Mrs. Winthrop&#xD;
to her room to examine the contents of the trunk.&#xD;
Grace found that a beautiful blue cashmere dress'&#xD;
&#xD;
J&#xD;
&#xD;
FIFTY YEARS AGO.&#xD;
&#xD;
191&#xD;
&#xD;
and sundry collars, handkerchiefs and ribbons had&#xD;
someway got in there for her. Laura had ascrim-&#xD;
son cashmere to match the blue one.&#xD;
"My brurtte and my blonde," said Mrs. Win-&#xD;
throp, "are represented in these two dresses."&#xD;
Grace adinired her's very much; and, as she&#xD;
passed her hand over the soft material, she asked&#xD;
her aunt if she could not cut and make it herself.&#xD;
"No, child, you want it at once ; Laura's dress-&#xD;
maker will do it."&#xD;
"I wish, aunt, you knew h w nicely I can fit&#xD;
myself. I shall have so much time for sewing. I&#xD;
am sure I must have something to do."&#xD;
"Time wiil get away faster than you imagine;&#xD;
but you need a pretty morning dress ;" and Mrs.&#xD;
Winthrop went to her wardrobe, and, after search-&#xD;
ing for  few minutes, took down a handsome one&#xD;
of her own. "Here is a dress which I was unfor-&#xD;
tunate enough to upset ink on the front breadth ;&#xD;
you may take it, and, leaving out that breadth,&#xD;
make it over! for yourself, taking one of Laura's for&#xD;
a pattern. ;Here is plenty of new material for.&#xD;
waist and'sleeves."&#xD;
Grace's "thank you,"-was very genuine,,for she&#xD;
had begun to wonder what occupation she should&#xD;
have.   he had been so used to a busy life that she&#xD;
easily imagined Boston, with nothing in it for her&#xD;
to do, ould be very dull.&#xD;
The twilight hour, again, brought visions of&#xD;
home. She strove to be cheerful, but she'was not&#xD;
sorry when she could go to sleep and dream of the&#xD;
life she had left, and which seemed to her now&#xD;
must be always fresh and beautiful.&#xD;

The next day was cold and wintry, but Grace&#xD;
did not heed it much, she was so bisy with her&#xD;
needle. The morning dress was f st assuming&#xD;
shape ; and, before her aunt thought such a thing&#xD;
possible, the young lady presented, herself most be-&#xD;
comingly arrayed in it.&#xD;
Grace had been in Boston nearly two weeks, and&#xD;
was sitting at twilight in her room thinking of&#xD;
home, and wishing she could hear fro  the  when&#xD;
Laura came smiling in.&#xD;
" Suppose I were a fairy," said she, 'what would&#xD;
you ask me to bring you."&#xD;
"A letter from home," said Grace.&#xD;
"Granted. HMere is a letter fro  Ernest; he&#xD;
writes very well,'' said she, glancing at the address&#xD;
as she handed it to her cousin."&#xD;
Grace took the letter eagerly, bu the moment&#xD;
her eye rested on it her deep blush drew Laura's&#xD;
attention.&#xD;
"All that over a letter from Ernest! I am afraid&#xD;
I must call you to an account for this; but you&#xD;
shall have a fair chance to enjoy it while I go and&#xD;
try a piece of music which came this afternoon.'&#xD;
Grace went to' the window, and, with a beating&#xD;
heart broke the seal. It was, indeed, a letter from&#xD;
Doctor Allerton, written so full of pleasant things,&#xD;
that she smiled, involuntarily as she read. Not an&#xD;
allusion to any thing that occurred he afternoon&#xD;
before she left. He told her of ho e, and of his&#xD;
own doings, in a way that held her an attentive&#xD;
reader to the end, and made her tur the sheet to&#xD;
see if, in some corner, she could not find another&#xD;

ot alone again until they went up to their&#xD;
They sat awhile talking over the events of&#xD;

e, glancing at the signature. "Grace, you&#xD;

letters after you. Well, he is a gentle&#xD;
and very intelligent, and if he lived i&#xD;
would not mind his letters now and t&#xD;
am too selfish to want you to have an~&#xD;

"No special interest in Beechford! X&#xD;
it's all the world to me."&#xD;
4(Just now, you tpean. But you mus&#xD;
in by degrees, as I have no doubt yo&#xD;
you get really interested in the pleasant&#xD;

The girls grew very social and con&#xD;
their warm hearth-stone, until Laura,&#xD;
her watch, said : "This will never do,-&#xD;
almost twelve, we must not speak an&#xD;
to-night."&#xD;
How well they adhered to that wise,&#xD;
will leave those to judge who have bee&#xD;
tempted ; only they were very silent w&#xD;
clock on the landing struck one.&#xD;
So far there had been a good deal c&#xD;
incident to their return from a long vi&#xD;
making, receiving calls, and getting rea&#xD;

Then came Tharksgiving, a feast wh&#xD;

loved so well. Sloe missed her grand&#xD;

aces gathered round it just one year ago, and&#xD;
new how they wanted her to-day. She miss-&#xD;
gr.andfather's prayer, so full of tenderness and&#xD;
t trust in the Giver of every good. She had&#xD;
thought before how much of her Thanksgiv-&#xD;
at prayer had beeA, and she did not now realize&#xD;
: much of the charm of her home-life lay in&#xD;
onderful, beautiful trust, which went up from'&#xD;
arts of her parents, to their Father in heaven.&#xD;
s was the first time in her life that she had&#xD;
)een absent from home on such an occasion,&#xD;
st clinging to her heart, among its tenderest&#xD;
actions, was the consciousness that thevoice&#xD;
yer sweetened the feast, even more, wa's itself&#xD;
of the Thanksgiving. She wondered how&#xD;
ncle, so kind and generous 'as he was, could&#xD;
to return thanks on such 'an occasion; but&#xD;
he never heard him pray. He was not very&#xD;

asked yo4i twice, some question, to which you&#xD;
paid not the slightest attention. Have you&#xD;
to Beechford ?"&#xD;

&#xD;
Graced roused very quickly at this, and turning&#xD;
to Mr. Sinclair made a truthful.apology, that she&#xD;
was thinking very strongly of .home, but she had&#xD;
conie back now, and would promise to be very at-&#xD;
tentive in future. She enjoyed the music, and re-&#xD;
sponded very heartily to her uncle's smile, when&#xD;
he told her how glad he was to have some, repre-&#xD;
sentative from Beqchford at. his Thanksgiving&#xD;
table.&#xD;
After Thanksgiving the odd routine of the house-&#xD;
hold seemed.established. Colonel Winthrop's uni-&#xD;
formity was unconsciously felt in all the family&#xD;
regulations. After breakfast Laura usually prac-&#xD;
ticed, while Grace read,-or sewed or wrote, just as&#xD;
she fancied. Then, if they had shopping, they&#xD;
went out, but were expected to be at home by&#xD;
twelve, the hour for driving in winter. They were&#xD;
usually at home again a little after one, in time to&#xD;
dress for dinner. Mrs. Winthrop remained in the&#xD;
parlor after that, and expected the young ladies to&#xD;
sit with her. They usually had some light sewing&#xD;
or embroidery. Then Grace often thought of her&#xD;
mother's mending-basket, and felt almost reproach-&#xD;
ed when she remembered how much she must be&#xD;
needed to take stitches which were necessarily&#xD;
added to her mother's and Annie's already filled&#xD;
up time.&#xD;
Mrs. Winthrop and Laura had a large circle of&#xD;
acquaintances, so th t they usually had calls after&#xD;
dinner. Wednesday afternoon Mrs. Winthrop made&#xD;
calls. Of course Grace was soon included in their&#xD;
list of friends, and began to go out with them.&#xD;
After tea they had music. Colonel Winthrop al-&#xD;

ing callers. Laura Winthrop was very at-&#xD;

clination which certain of her friends had to&#xD;
s often as seemed desirable.&#xD;
was a generally understood fact, that Colonel&#xD;
:hrop would expect to be well pleased before&#xD;
ould consent to bestow his daughter's hand&#xD;
ny man. So far his wishes and hers had never&#xD;
in collision in that respect. She enjoyed&#xD;
pleasant circle of friends, but was in no haste&#xD;
ange her present mode of life. She had. not&#xD;
hed twenty years without abundant opportu-&#xD;
for coquetry ; but this was not an element in&#xD;
h she took any special pleasure. She was&#xD;
and bright, but she had a real, living heart,&#xD;
[ craved strong, healthful nourishment. Now&#xD;
Grace for e companion, she would have been.&#xD;
content to i1ake home-pleasures her chief joy&#xD;

different. She must accept invitations and&#xD;

orgetfulness of self gave her, a quiet, self-pos-&#xD;

glowing in her heart,.and when a letter ca e, her.&#xD;
gladness was child-like in its expression. She had.&#xD;
answered Doctor Allerton's letter finding it not&#xD;
such a difficult task as she had anticipated. Her&#xD;
journey furnished themes enough.  His second&#xD;
letter had been even more acceptable than t e first,&#xD;
it 'seemed less like a stranger. On the whole, thirst-&#xD;
ing for home news as she was, the arrangement&#xD;
might be a very good one, since it involved not the&#xD;
least obligation on either side.&#xD;
Ernest had written, but he was very bush. He.&#xD;
was teaching again, and reciting by himself to Doc-&#xD;
tor Allerton, of whom he spoke in term of in-&#xD;
creasing respect and confidence. He missed Grace&#xD;
every where ; it seemed to him that all Beechford&#xD;
was lonely without her. Annie, out of the multi-&#xD;
tude of her cares, wrote very seldom. She wrote&#xD;
cheerfully, but Grace always felt a little sad after&#xD;
reading her letters. .She thought of her o vn leis-&#xD;
ure, and Annie's busy hours, and still shecculd not&#xD;
see how she could help it. Once she spoke of this&#xD;
to Laura.&#xD;
A few days after Laura came up-stair's with a large&#xD;
roll of linen in her arms. "Here, Grace," said she,&#xD;
"is a present from mother to you, to mak up for&#xD;
Annie, it will gladden your sisterly heart, I know,&#xD;
and give you an idea that you are doing so ebody&#xD;
some good. I will help you sew, now ou hands&#xD;
are full, and we do not care how often it storms."&#xD;
Grace was delighted, now she could inde d help&#xD;
Annie. "You will have to be my scholar, Laura,&#xD;
for in plain sewing j know that I could teaci you."&#xD;
"Mrs. Clark will think you more wonderful than&#xD;

CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
HOW   THE DAYS WENT ON.'&#xD;
. rp HE sewing was like a charm to Grace, and&#xD;
T   the days flew on rapidly, until the earl part&#xD;
of January had come. She sat by the bright,&#xD;
cheerful fire sewing and thinking when Laura came&#xD;
up from practicing. "Here, Miss Grace," said she,&#xD;
"see what is expected of you. Mrs. Marshall has&#xD;
sent invitations for a party next week. So you&#xD;
will have to lay asides your practical work, and set&#xD;
about preparing for t e occasion.".&#xD;
i Oh, Laura ! I can' go ; I have n't any th ng to&#xD;
wear, besides  -"&#xD;
S" Not another wor I; Colonel Winthrop will not&#xD;
excuse you, unless you are sick in bed. The&#xD;
Marshall's are his special friends, and go you must.&#xD;
And by way of encouragement, let me tell you'&#xD;
this is only the beginning of a series."&#xD;
"'Oh, Laura !"&#xD;
Laura laughed. "Mother is going out this&#xD;
morning to get you a dress."&#xD;
"Let me wear one of your old ones."&#xD;
"No, Miss Grace, I shall not agree to that; you&#xD;
are to be new entirely. Mother says she shall shop&#xD;
(zoo)&#xD;
&#xD;
I,&#xD;
&#xD;
FIFTY YEARS AGO.&#xD;
&#xD;
this morning, and we can go oi not, as we&#xD;
please."&#xD;
"I'll stay-at home, then.. I had rather aunt&#xD;
woulld select what she pleases without asking me."&#xD;
"And I will go; so you- may sit in expectancy&#xD;
until our return."&#xD;
Laura was -soon ready, and accompanied .her&#xD;
mother out, while Grace sewed on and wondered&#xD;
if going to parties would be half as, pleasant as&#xD;
their social evenings at home.&#xD;
When Laura returned, she placed in her cousin's&#xD;
hands a roll, with her mother's compliments. Grace&#xD;
open d it and discovered a dress-pattern, of rich,&#xD;
white silk.. She surveyed it with afeeling akin to&#xD;
dismay. It was more elegant than she. ever saw&#xD;
for a bride to wear, and now she was to be arrayed&#xD;
in it for an evening party!&#xD;
" When you recover sufficiently, I should like to&#xD;
show you mine," said her cousin, highly amused at&#xD;
the expression of her speaking face. Opening her&#xD;
package, she, displayed a dress of the same mate-&#xD;
rial, only it was pink.-&#xD;
"Are you relieved by seeing this ?"&#xD;
"Yes ; that' seems so beautiful and proper for&#xD;
you, but I think I should have a less costly mate-&#xD;
rial."&#xD;
"Don't criticise your aunt's taste," said Laura.&#xD;
"Shemight not like it, you'know; she has engaged&#xD;
the dress-maker to come to-morrow, so behold&#xD;
yourself arrayed ! Will you take a pocket-hand-&#xD;
kerchief to-hem,.you queer, old-fashioned body, or&#xD;
will you spend the evening.at Mrs. Marshall's, just&#xD;
as I ave had to spend a great nany. I'm so glad&#xD;

&#xD;
mother has somebody to, fix besides me, and that&#xD;
that somebody is you, Grace Winthrop."&#xD;
The dressmaking was accomplished and every-&#xD;
thing in readiness for the party. The evening was&#xD;
clear and cold, and the two girls were in their'&#xD;
room dressing. Grace's beautiful hair had a way&#xD;
of its own, which Laura. always insisted should be&#xD;
followed in dressing it.  Her cheeks wer rosy&#xD;
with health, and her violet eyes were full f ex-&#xD;
pression.  She was taller than Laura, th  two&#xD;
formed a striking contrast.. Laura's pink silk and&#xD;
flowers of the same hue in her jet black hai were&#xD;
very becoming.&#xD;
"Here, Grace," said she, "you must wear my&#xD;
pearls to-night; they are all you need to complete&#xD;
your dress."&#xD;
"Pearls, Laura! I think I have on borrowed&#xD;
plumage enough ; please do not add your beautiful&#xD;
pearls. I shall surely lose them ; besides, I've got&#xD;
into the mist of fairy land again. I expect all my&#xD;
fine things may vanish at any moment."&#xD;
"Grace Winthrop, you are a queer girl; you&#xD;
will appear in Mrs. Mar hall's .drawing-room to-&#xD;
night as if you had worh white silk always; and&#xD;
my pearls will seem 'to de honored by your wear-&#xD;
ing them. I think father must have been thinking&#xD;
of you when he bought them. I admire them very&#xD;
much, but they are too fair for me. I must see&#xD;
them on you to-night. I am sure you will wear&#xD;
them to please me."&#xD;
"Yes, to please you; but if I lose them?"&#xD;
I will take the blame, then." So Laura clasped&#xD;
the pearls about her cousin s neck and arms, and&#xD;
&#xD;
FIFTY YEARS AGO.         203&#xD;
&#xD;
smiled in quiet satisfaction t9 see how well they&#xD;
became her. The mirror reflected a lovely picture,&#xD;
as Grace stoo before it to see the effect of Laura's&#xD;
pearls, and just at that moment she remembered&#xD;
a verse her mother gave her to learn once when&#xD;
she was a little girl and had shown strong symp-&#xD;
toms of vanity: "Whose adorning, let it not be&#xD;
that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of&#xD;
wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; but let&#xD;
it be the hidden man of the heart." It came like a&#xD;
gentle, friendly whisper, and seemed to give the&#xD;
outward adornment its real place. The principles&#xD;
of internal beauty, in which she had been so thor-&#xD;
oughly trained, asserted their supremacy and&#xD;
quenched the uprisings of vanity. She knew that&#xD;
her dress was rich and becoming, and she admired&#xD;
it, but she knew that it was not herself.&#xD;
Mrs. Marshall's drawing-room was brilliant with&#xD;
the guests .assembled there, the very lite of the&#xD;
city  Colonel Winthrop was always one of the last&#xD;
to arrive on such occasions, for the sole reason that&#xD;
being obliged to stay until a proper hour for leav-&#xD;
ing, he shortened the time while he had it in his&#xD;
control. An hour later in his arrival, made an&#xD;
hour less to stay. He liked dinner parties; but he&#xD;
only endured evening parties because .he wished&#xD;
his wife and daughter to observe the customs of&#xD;
society.&#xD;
Mrs. Winthrop was conscious of chaperoning&#xD;
two. very pretty girls; and enjoyed the attention&#xD;
they received. T~o Grace the scene was novel and&#xD;
interesting.. She enjoyed it in perfect unconscious.&#xD;
ness of the pleasing impressions. she was making.&#xD;

&#xD;
She forgot her white silk dress,.and even Laura's&#xD;
pearls, in' listening to and observing the people&#xD;
about her; nor was she deficient in her share of&#xD;
conversation. Shehad met Henry Marshall and&#xD;
several other of'the gentlemen at her uncle's house.&#xD;
She had met all of Laura's particular lady friends,&#xD;
so she was not quite a stranger. She designed to&#xD;
keep as near Laura as possible, but they were often&#xD;
unavoidably separated ; then her quick perceptive&#xD;
faculties proved verge reliable friends. During the&#xD;
evening she was introduced to a Mr. Lenox, who&#xD;
like herself had lately come to Boston. He was a&#xD;
nephew of Mrs. Marshall and had just commenced&#xD;
practicing law. - He attached. himself particularly&#xD;
.to her, quite to the annoyance, Laura thought, of&#xD;
some who called themselves older friends.&#xD;
The evening had its variety of amusement and&#xD;
entertainment and quickly wore away. Colonel&#xD;
Winthrop was as sure to be the first to go as he&#xD;
had been the last to come. His friends laughed at&#xD;
what they termed his "military precision," but'&#xD;
that never moved his purpose.&#xD;
"It is time to go,' Mrs. Winthrop," wasthe sig:&#xD;
nal for that lady, without undue haste, to assemble&#xD;
her forces and be ready to leave. Henry Marshall&#xD;
and Mr. Lenox were waiting to escort the young&#xD;
ladies to the carriage.&#xD;
"Well, Grace !" said Colonel Winthrop, on their&#xD;
Way home, "how have you enjoyed your first party&#xD;
in:Bostonb?"&#xD;
"Very much, uncle; it seemed to me something&#xD;
like a moving picture and I as looking on."&#xD;
" I think you more than looked on," said&#xD;

Lau. "Ernest would say you made a figure&#xD;
in it."&#xD;
"I do not 'qdite understand who that Mr. Lenox&#xD;
was, Laura," said her father.&#xD;
"He is a nephew of Mrs. Marshall's, a young&#xD;
[awyer lately come to Boston. Mrs. Marshall in-&#xD;
troduced him to us."&#xD;
" Oh!.very well.", And Laura knew her father&#xD;
was satisfied so far. When they reached home the&#xD;
girls went directly to their room, where they found&#xD;
i cheerful fire, and Mrs. Clark asleep in an easy&#xD;
:hair. i She was a faithful old sentinel; and after&#xD;
luly admiring -the young ladies, and putting up&#xD;
:heir wrappers, she left them to get warm before&#xD;
;hey went to bed.&#xD;
" Here are your pearls, Laura," said Grace, as&#xD;
;he carefully replaced them in the jewel case. ":I&#xD;
im h ppy to return them safe and sound, and to&#xD;
ay that they did not keep me in an anxious state&#xD;
ill the evening. My attention was so occupied&#xD;

the people if I had ! I saw some ladies there to-&#xD;
night who were all made up, of fine clothes; it&#xD;
seemed to me that they laughed when there was&#xD;
nothing to laugh at, and talked when they had&#xD;
nothing to say. I saw a lady hanging on Mr.&#xD;
Rexford's arm., who reminded me so strongly of&#xD;
one of the pictures on Aunt Lois's fan that Ilwas&#xD;
half a mind to shake - hands with her, for old ac-&#xD;
quaintance sake. I saw some very pretty ones&#xD;
too, and some beautiful dresses."&#xD;
"Did you see much of Lizzie M rshall ?"&#xD;
"Yes, and I liked her very much."&#xD;
"How.did you like the gentlemen-Mr. Lenox,&#xD;
for instance ?"&#xD;
"Very well; I think he is very agreeable."&#xD;
"Do you like Henry Marshall ?"&#xD;
"Yes, I do; better than ,any of your gentlemen&#xD;
acquaintances; he seems to me frank and sin ere,&#xD;
like Ernest."&#xD;
"How does he compare with Robert 9ak-&#xD;
ley?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"I like him better. You know I did not&#xD;
much of Robert Oakley, but I think I should&#xD;
ways like Henry Marshall best. I am so usei&#xD;
Ernest's manly ways that I do not fancy pe&#xD;
who say so many things which I am sure t&#xD;
cannot mean."&#xD;
"Do you call Robert Oakley a flatterer?"&#xD;
"Perhaps that is not just what I should call Ih&#xD;
I should believe Henry Marshall when I shc&#xD;
not believe Robert. Oakley ; but, Laura, what&#xD;

som thing better suited to 'going right to bed,' as&#xD;
Auntie told us to when we came up-stairs?"&#xD;
Laura roused herself and began to lay aside her&#xD;
dres .&#xD;
"I is such a luxury to have, somebody to go out&#xD;
with me and then come home and chat over a nice&#xD;
fire," said she, "that I shall forget to go to bed at&#xD;
all by-and-by."&#xD;
It took Grace some time to get asleep after she&#xD;
and Laura had said good-night. She was thinking&#xD;
of the last winter evenings, where they all met in&#xD;
Mrs. Lee's sitting-room and recited to Dr. Aller-&#xD;
ton. She was very happy then, and as she went&#xD;
over the scenes - and contrasted them  with .this&#xD;
evening, she fell asleep and knew no more of the&#xD;
joys and sorrows of life until Mrs. Clark opened&#xD;
the linds and let in a full tide of morning light.&#xD;
H nry Marshall and Mr. Lenox were guests at&#xD;
Col nel Winthrop's house the next evening after&#xD;
Mrs. Marshall's party; indeed, from that time they&#xD;
were often there. Mrs. Marshall's party was, as&#xD;
Laura had said, only the beginning of a series.&#xD;
More new dresses were purchased, until Grace&#xD;
found herself in possession of quite an extensive&#xD;
wardrobe. She had persuaded her aunt to dis-&#xD;
pense with the dress-maker beyond fitting. She&#xD;
proved herself so skillful and capable with her nee-&#xD;
dle, that Mrs. Winthrop was quite satisfied with its&#xD;
results. Her time was now fully occupied ; they.&#xD;
rarely had an evening to themselves. If they were&#xD;
at. home, .Henry Marshall or Mr. Lenox or Mr.&#xD;
Rexford were there, sometimes all three at once:&#xD;

sation, and Mrs. Winthrop, in her easy chair,&#xD;
always an entertaining hostess. One evening&#xD;
the early partlof February, they were all at a pa&#xD;
at Mrs. Sinclair's. .Grace had been listening tc&#xD;
entertaining account of some of Mr, Lenox's trav&#xD;
when she bethought her of Laura and proposed&#xD;
go and look her up. Mr. Lenox rallied her on'&#xD;
great devotion to her cousin, remarking at&#xD;
same time that she was standing nearly oppo&#xD;
them in the next room apparently quite interes&#xD;
in conversation with a gentleman who was&#xD;
stranger to him. Grace looked over that way a&#xD;
was quite surprised to see Robert Oakley. La&#xD;
caught her eye that moment and nodded.&#xD;
"It is a friend of her's whom we 'met in N&#xD;
York," said Grace. "They are coming this wa&#xD;
Mr. Oakley's greeting was very cordial.&#xD;
had come to Boston for a few days to see his&#xD;
"friends. He met Mr. Sinclair soon after his arrive&#xD;
and Mrs. Sinclair had sent him an invitation&#xD;
come to her house that evening. He was very att&#xD;
tive to both of the young ladies. Grace did r&#xD;
quite understand it, but she thought Laura v&#xD;
not as lively as usual, and once or twice detail&#xD;
her near her, for some very trifling reason. Cc&#xD;
nel Winthrop left earlier than usual. On th&#xD;
way home, he said, rather sternly, "Laura, did&#xD;
expect to meet Robert Oakley at Mrs. Sinclair's&#xD;
"No,.sir; I did not know when he was comic&#xD;
to Boston.".&#xD;
"Well, it's a foolish thing this, for people to&#xD;
traveling about.in winter. Better stay at home,&#xD;

case meant Robert Oakley; and the "foolishness,"&#xD;
i her father's mind, was his probable errand.&#xD;
Until their visit, in New York, she had never&#xD;
t ougit of any closer friendship between Robert&#xD;
akle and herself than had always existed. At&#xD;
times, Isince then, she had not felt, quite so sure-&#xD;
perhaps not quite so sure of herself either-at&#xD;
I ast, until recently. She had seen so much of&#xD;
Henry Marshall,  during the winter, that she had&#xD;
come to regard him as a very pleasant friend.&#xD;
race- had unconsciously drawn them together.&#xD;
She had from the first liked him; because he was&#xD;
in some .things, she fancied, after the manner of&#xD;
Ernes". To be "like Ernest," Laura knew meant&#xD;
as high a. compliment as Grace could pay, and&#xD;
Grace had such an instinctive insight into charac-&#xD;
ter, that Laura found herself influenced by her&#xD;
more than she could have thought possible.&#xD;
To-:bight, when they were seated by their. own&#xD;
glowing fire, ready to talk over the events of the&#xD;
evenirig, Laura's face wore a troubled look, and'&#xD;
she poked the fire in a restless sort of way, as if&#xD;
she hoped to rouse up something cheering from its&#xD;
embers.&#xD;
.What a dreadfllyunsatisfactory fire that is;'&#xD;
said Grace, laughing.&#xD;
ell, don't you know the fire has been 'my&#xD;
companion. I've had to think to it, and talk to it,&#xD;
befor I had you, and I forget sometimes. Grace,&#xD;

now. Did you see how coldly father met him,&#xD;
we used to be such pleasant friends ?"&#xD;
" Why does your father dislike him ?"&#xD;
"Do you remember the night we came f&#xD;
Mrs. Marshall's party, you told me you.should&#xD;
lieve Henry Marshall when you should not beli&#xD;
Robert Oakley ?" .&#xD;
"I had forgotten it; but I should, Laura."&#xD;
"I think that is what father means, though&#xD;
manner of telling me was so different, that it m&#xD;
me think he did -him great injustice."&#xD;
" Do you like Robert Oakley ?"&#xD;
"Yes, and no. I did like him when I saw&#xD;
in New York. I mean, I was pleased with him&#xD;
"Until you liked somebody else better; an&#xD;
do I. Don't blush, Laura. I know how very&#xD;
tentive our friend Henry is. I think uncle li'&#xD;
him, too, for he told me the other day that He&#xD;
Marshall was a man to be trusted."&#xD;
" I have very pleasant remembrances of Rob&#xD;
Oakley," said' Laura, "and I hope I am mista&#xD;
in the reason of his coming to Boston ; but, fr O&#xD;

never be any thing but .friends. I think he was&#xD;
disappointed in my lack of pleasure at meeting&#xD;
him this evening. -I did not mean to be unkind,&#xD;
but I was sorry h6 had come."&#xD;
"I do not see any great difficulty in getting&#xD;

what he wants you to."&#xD;
" I had rather ie would never know that his&#xD;

told you what tr9 ubles me, and a little sleep, if I&#xD;
can get it, will ma ke me better still."&#xD;
The next day, at the usual hour for riding, Grace&#xD;
came down stairs alone, and met her uncle just&#xD;
buttoning up his overcoat in the hall. "Where is'&#xD;
Laura," said he.&#xD;
"She wishes yqu would excuse her, uncle. She&#xD;

in. dread, to what explanation Grace might be&#xD;
obliged to make. She knew her fearless, winning&#xD;
way was equal to an emergency, and that she&#xD;

"Do you believe she would accept him if&#xD;
should offer himself ?" and Colonel Winthrop lo&#xD;
d so sternly at her, that she was almost frighte&#xD;
" I do not believe she would ; I am quite cer&#xD;
he would not,&#xD;
"I think you know better than I do, but I&#xD;
ot like Robert Oakley. I like his father&#xD;
other, but h says too many foolish things. F&#xD;
haps he does no know it ; but h  woul1 care m&#xD;

ould for Laura herself. It will do for old me&#xD;

t mptible thing. I have no respect for him, or&#xD;
t ence with him. I thought when you first c&#xD;

did, for- she advised me to let you take your own&#xD;
way. She thought your companionship would be&#xD;
of service to Laura, and so I think it has. You are on&#xD;
very friendly terms with Henry Marshall I observe."&#xD;
"Yes, sir, I like him, and I think Laura does,&#xD;
too. I liked him from the first, because I thought&#xD;
he had some ways like Ernest."&#xD;
"He is to be relied on, and his business habits&#xD;
are excellent. YoU have had such a home educa-&#xD;
.on, Grace, that you know what real worth is, and&#xD;
1 would trust your judgment sOoner than I would&#xD;
some of our Boston girls."&#xD;
Colonel Winthrop was by this 'time in good hu-&#xD;
mor, evidently quite relieved by the truthful man-&#xD;
ner of his niece. When they reached home, he&#xD;
looked at his watch, and said, as they had 'nearly&#xD;
an hour before diner, he would drive on and walk&#xD;
back. Grace wen in, and as the parlor 'door was&#xD;
shut, she went on utp to her aunt's door and knockeI&#xD;
softly. There was no response, and thinking she&#xD;
might be sleeping, she went on to her room.&#xD;
Laura was not there, and after :making herself&#xD;
ready for dinner, she sat down to sew for Annie,&#xD;
thinking what a satisfactory ride she had had, and&#xD;
what an unsatisfactory one she might have had if&#xD;
she and her uncle had been in opposite interests.&#xD;
Just before the hour for dinner, Laura came up.&#xD;
stairs, looking as if she lacked the vigor which a&#xD;
cheerful heart anl the invigorating morning air,&#xD;
had given her couin.&#xD;
" Has Mr. Oakley gone ?" asked Grace, after&#xD;
waiting awhile for Laura to speak.&#xD;

DEVELOPMENTS.&#xD;
f   NE morning,   few weeks after the events&#xD;
mentioned in the last chapter, Grace had&#xD;
been out alone to buy some of the innumerable&#xD;
trimmings which her aunt deemed necessary for&#xD;
an eveni g dress. She had finished her errand,&#xD;
and was r turning, hen she met Mr. Lenox. He&#xD;
turned and joined her in her walk. The day was&#xD;
fine, and the sleighing excellent. He proposed&#xD;
calling for her after dinner to take a ride.&#xD;
"If Laura has no engagements, I think we can&#xD;
go," said Grace.&#xD;
"Your cousin is a very agreeable companion,&#xD;
Miss Winthrop; but for once I would like to see&#xD;
how you appear separately. If you have no objec-&#xD;
tions, I will only extend my invitation to you this&#xD;
time."&#xD;
. Grace thanked him and accepted, feeling half&#xD;
afraid she had done wrong. She never went.out&#xD;
without Laura, and if her uncle should happen to&#xD;
fancy that it was not desirable for her to do so, she&#xD;
had certainly got herself into trouble. Mr. Lenox;&#xD;
of late, had been very attentive. Doctor Allerton&#xD;

so often found herself contrasting ti&#xD;

Doctor Allerton brought home and all&#xD;
so freshly to her mind? She did not&#xD;
accept this invitation without it inc&#xD;
but considering the intimacy betwe&#xD;
family and t ie Marshall's, and her ow&#xD;
with Mr. Lenox, she thought it wou&#xD;
to refuse. When she reached home,&#xD;
ly up-stairs to tell Laura.&#xD;
"You di right to accept; father&#xD;
he likes Mr Lenox."&#xD;
At the difner-table Laura mention&#xD;

"Shall we take a look at Bunker Hill? It seems&#xD;
to be the attractive spot just now."&#xD;
"Any where you please," said Grace.&#xD;
"I please to ride," said Mr. Lenox, laughing,&#xD;
"and just now Bunker Hill seems the most famil-&#xD;
iar spot I can remember."&#xD;
"I forgot you are a new-homer,' said Grace,&#xD;
" and perhaps do not know the drives about Bos-&#xD;
ton as well as I do. Uncle considers riding part&#xD;
of our daily business; so we get very familiar with&#xD;
the beautiful views in the whole vicinity. He&#xD;
minds the cold very little, and fresh airis his rem-&#xD;
edy for every thing. Laura says she and auntie&#xD;
ought to be order-loving, for they have had good&#xD;
military training ever since she can remem-&#xD;
ber."&#xD;
I suppose your uncle owes his good health to&#xD;
his uniform exercise," said Mr. Lenox. "Uncle&#xD;
Marshall tells me he was a man of great energy&#xD;
and constant-activity. The change from a busi-&#xD;
ness-life to one of comparative rest must be very&#xD;
trying to such a person.'&#xD;
Unconsciously, then, Grace spoke of her father&#xD;
and of home until she almost forgot that her at-.&#xD;
tentive listener was so lately a stranger.&#xD;
It was enough for Mr. Lenox to watch the kind-&#xD;
ling, glowing face of the young girl beside him as&#xD;
she spoke of Ernest, an the many rides she had&#xD;
had with him,coasting nd sleighing and on horse-&#xD;
back.&#xD;
Before they knew it, they had reached: Bunker&#xD;

She saw that her answer did not please him.. In&#xD;
her own sweet way, she quickly added, "I have&#xD;
had a very pleasant rid , Mr. Lenox, and shall&#xD;
hope to see ±ou soon."&#xD;
"Perhaps I ought not to have said that,' thought&#xD;
she, as she stood waiting for Ralph to let her in.&#xD;
She went directly to her room to lay aside her'&#xD;
wrappings and get warm before going down to the&#xD;
parlor. She felt troubled. An undefined sense of&#xD;
something real, into which she must enter, was&#xD;
somewhere in the distance--.a feeling akin to that&#xD;
which one might have in watching a net-work&#xD;
weaving about him without consenting to the pro-&#xD;
cess and yet seeming to have no power to escape.&#xD;
She stood thinking so intently that she forgot&#xD;
how near the tea-hour was until she heard Mrs.&#xD;
Clark coming to look for her. .Turning, to pick&#xD;
up her handkerchief, which she had laid on the&#xD;
table, she saw a letter directed to her lying there.&#xD;
She took it up and recognized Doctor Allerton's&#xD;
writing.&#xD;
How strange it is! Doctor Allerton always&#xD;
comes in collision with Mr. Lenox.- Here I find&#xD;
him waiting for me; and with a sense of gladness&#xD;
and relief she put it ii he po ket and went downs&#xD;
stairs.&#xD;
"Why !" said Laura," did not know you had&#xD;
come in. Have you been at home long ?"&#xD;
" ot long ; only time enough to get warm."&#xD;
" You look as if the air had done you good,"&#xD;
said\her uncle. "You haia fine ride, I suppose."&#xD;
After tea, Grace joined Laura at the piano.&#xD;
Go and read your letter if you want to," said&#xD;

the passin events of home took he&#xD;
all the fres ness of a year ago..&#xD;
"How Much I enjoy these letters&#xD;

home and its association 'than she had ever done&#xD;
before. He did not see  to be such a "wise, old&#xD;
man" as she had always thought him-not that his&#xD;
wisdom grew lcss in he estimation, but she was&#xD;
becoming more' accustomed to the society of&#xD;
gentlemen of his age.&#xD;
Charlie Thorn and Edward Nelson were more&#xD;
like brothers. They had been school-mates from&#xD;
childhood, playfellows with whom she had always&#xD;
felt such equality. that sh could laugh and enjoy&#xD;
their mutual sports without remembering that she&#xD;
was no longer a little girl. Now it was all differ-.&#xD;
ent. She was brought in contact with people so&#xD;
much older than herself and was expected to rise&#xD;
to their level. Mr. Lenox was as old as Doctor&#xD;
Allerton;, Henry Marshall/and Mr. Rexford were&#xD;
older. As she grew better acquainted with these&#xD;
gentlemen, it had the effect of making her feel bet&#xD;
ter acquainted with Doctor Allerton.&#xD;
Her revery could not last, for her uncle would&#xD;
notice her absence at this hour; and as she only&#xD;
mentioned Ernest's and Annie's letters, she pre,&#xD;
ferredto give no occasion for questioning.&#xD;
Laura knew, by her bright expression,,that some-&#xD;
thing had made. her happy.&#xD;
" Is it Mr. Lenox or octor Allerton ?" whis-&#xD;

eye.&#xD;
"Neither," said Grace. "It is home and Beedh-&#xD;

FIFTY YEARS AGO.&#xD;

&#xD;
Lenox played the flute and Mr. Marshall sang, so&#xD;
they often had musical entertainments.&#xD;
Mr. Lenox was not here this even ng, but Henry&#xD;
Marshall and Mr. Rexford were, and     Laura&#xD;
thought her cousin's voice had caught the echo of&#xD;
the birds, it rang out so clear and sweet.&#xD;
"I never told you much about m  mother's sing-&#xD;
ing," said Colonel Winthrop, as he paused in front&#xD;
of Mrs. Winthrop's chair.  "Our Laura .has a&#xD;
sweet voice, but Grace has tones o exactly' like&#xD;
her grandmother that I hear her almost as dis-&#xD;
tinctly as I used to when I was a ittle boy; and&#xD;
the world held no treasure like my  other."&#xD;
He .did not wait for Mrs. Winthrop's answer,&#xD;
but continued his walk, with 'his thoughts turned&#xD;
backward to old scenes which he had deemed all&#xD;
faded out. When the music ceased, he said, "Sing&#xD;
again. I l ve to listen to.you," and they sang on&#xD;
until the evening was nearly passed, before their&#xD;
host remembered much of present things. "Home&#xD;
is the pleasantest place, girls," said he, after their&#xD;
guests were gone and he was securing the win-&#xD;
dows. "I shall be glad when our evening visits&#xD;
are through with."&#xD;
"Grace and I enjoy our evenings t home," said&#xD;
Laura. "I think we have been out a great deal&#xD;
this winter.'&#xD;
They had, indeed, accepted more invitations&#xD;
than usual, ut Colonel Winthrop's abit of going&#xD;
late, and co ing away as soon as politeness would&#xD;
allow, had s vd them from very late ours.. Some-&#xD;
times his friends rallied him on hi early leave-&#xD;
taking, but he only shook his head, and..said, "I&#xD;
&#xD;
222&#xD;
&#xD;
FIFTY YEARS AGO.           223&#xD;
approve of sociability, bu I do not approve of late&#xD;
hours. Besides, we go o t so often, it is necessary.&#xD;
to be in the habit of reaching home before morn-&#xD;
ing."&#xD;
Mr. Lenox was a ple sant friend, and always&#xD;
ready to attend Grace o these occasions, but she&#xD;
was careful not to give 'him too much opportunity.&#xD;
She could not define her eelings in respect to him.&#xD;
She certainly liked him. His pleasing address&#xD;
and cultivated mind made him acceptable every-&#xD;
where. And what of    r. Lenox? -.He certainly&#xD;
liked Grace Winthrop.  e was attracted by her&#xD;
face the first evening he et her at Mrs. Marshall's.&#xD;
The whole company were strangers to him, and&#xD;
he had come more in the mood to, criticise than&#xD;
to cultivate anybody's acquaintance. He had&#xD;
been introduced to several ladies before the Win-&#xD;
throp party arrived. He did not see them when&#xD;
they came in, but, in looking for Henry Marshall,&#xD;
he saw a beautiful girl standing near his aunt. H r&#xD;
attire was rich, bpt so simple and so in unison wilh&#xD;
the style of her face and figure, that he paused to&#xD;
admire her, and then sought, an introduction.&#xD;
From that evening he had cultivated Grace Win-&#xD;
throp's acq uaintance.  e was charmed' with her&#xD;
sprightly, intelligent conversation , so unlike the&#xD;
style of the young' ladies he was accustomed to&#xD;
meet on such occasions.. He was a favorite in so-&#xD;
ciety, and used to flattering attentions. But she&#xD;
puzzled him. She was always polite, but never&#xD;
manifested any especial pleasure at meeting him.&#xD;
He had been wishing for an informal opportunity&#xD;
to get her all to himself for a little while. Eve-&#xD;

could ask for her. His delicate attentions and his&#xD;
thoughtful kindness were such as her refined taste&#xD;
could -fully appreciate. He could make her future&#xD;
home one of luxury and ease. Thrown so much&#xD;
into his society, she could not fail to know that her&#xD;
coming gave him pleasure, that his hand extended&#xD;
to greet her and draw her to himself, whenever an&#xD;
opportunity occurred. .As the weeks went on, she&#xD;
grew more conscious that an interview she dread-&#xD;
ed would meet her somewhere. Sometimes she&#xD;
thought she really loved Mr. Lenox, and if Doctor&#xD;
Allerton's image came thrusting itself between&#xD;
them, she would grow indignant and determine&#xD;
never to answer another of his letters. She' usually&#xD;
ended in wishing for the days of her childhood,&#xD;
when her mother could decide doubtful question.&#xD;
She did not know that that same mother was&#xD;
daily praying that she might he .led in a way&#xD;
which would 'work out the most abundant honor&#xD;
to her Heavenly Father, and be for her own high-&#xD;
est good. She did not realize hdw deeply inter-&#xD;
woven with her very being were the prayers she&#xD;
had heard, and the principles she had been taught,&#xD;
all through that childhood for which she had&#xD;
longed. She did not know that she had come to&#xD;
one of life's turning points around which clustered.&#xD;
'so much of the great; shadowy future. The path&#xD;
she would 'take seemed all of her own choosing.&#xD;
" Except thy presence go with her, take her not&#xD;
hence" was uttered in faith, when she left her fa-&#xD;
ther's house; and that " Presence" was with the&#xD;
maiden, tQ guide and influence her in all the trying&#xD;
circumstances in which she might be placed.&#xD;

MRS. WINTHROP gave the lst 'party of&#xD;

two young lad es were much admi ed.    Grace&#xD;

morning some b autiful rose-buds.  hen she was&#xD;

"They are 1 vely," said Laura.  ' I wish you&#xD;
would wear the ."&#xD;
"I cannot se why I should not ; a flower is a&#xD;
very simple gift, and I am sure I like Mr. Lenox&#xD;
well enough to  ear his flowers."&#xD;
" I cannot see why you should not ike him well&#xD;
enough to wear his name, if he should ask you to."&#xD;
"Don't, Laur a! I want to' disc nnect these&#xD;
flowers from any such associations.  am going to,&#xD;
enjoy a real pleasant friendship."&#xD;
Laura smiled and continued dressing, while&#xD;
Grace arrange  the flowers in her hair. It was a&#xD;
very pleasant arty, particularly to Mr. Lenox;&#xD;
not that he sec red Grace to himself as much as&#xD;
usual, but he re arded the disposal of his flowers&#xD;

as a good omen, and determined to decide the mat-&#xD;
te r as soon as an opportunity presented itself. Par-&#xD;
ties werd done with for the present, and neither of&#xD;
the girls were sorry. Grace could not divest her-&#xD;
self of the feeling that she was living very much&#xD;
for herself. She often thought of her mother's&#xD;
weary footsteps and Annie's busy fingers, and then&#xD;
she sewed industriously on the yet unfinished gar-&#xD;
ments for her sister. Jaura shared in the pleasure&#xD;
'of Doctor Allerton's letters, and often remarked,&#xD;
that they always made her feel as if there was&#xD;
something higher to be attained than she had ever&#xD;
found.&#xD;
"lHe does not preach," said she ; "he carries you&#xD;
right along aid makes you think as he does, and&#xD;
he tells of things at home so charmingly that I al-&#xD;
ways see just how it looks there."&#xD;
Grace thought so too, even if she did not say so.&#xD;
She did not find them difficult to answer, either;&#xD;
they were so suggestive, and she never thought&#xD;
how much thmy influenced her.&#xD;
One evening in the latter part of April Colonel&#xD;
Winthrop was suffering fro  a severe cold and&#xD;
headache, a ting so unusual with him, that he re-&#xD;
quired Mrs. Winthrop's constant attention.  He&#xD;
went to his room as soon as tea was over, and the&#xD;
girls were left alone in the parlor. It seemed so&#xD;
still all over the house, and so unusual to have a&#xD;
quiet evening down-stairs, that Laura declared it&#xD;
was either the Spring air or t, e silent house which&#xD;
had made. her -very sleepy. She believed she&#xD;
should go to lied.&#xD;
" I am not sleepy," said Grace. " I do not be-&#xD;

lieve we shall have any company, so I I ill let you&#xD;
go while I stay and finish the book which I began&#xD;
last .week."&#xD;
"That is a very good example for me, but I can-&#xD;
not follow it to-nfight. I've been sleepy all day."&#xD;
" Mother says sleep is a very good medicine,"&#xD;
said Grace, laug ing. "So go and take it and I&#xD;
will have a nice time all to myself."&#xD;
Laura went, and Grace, drawing her aunt's easy&#xD;
chair near the light, sat down to read. Her book&#xD;
was very interesting, and she was soon deeply en-&#xD;
gaged in its contents. How long she had been&#xD;
reading, she did ot know. She did not hear any-&#xD;
body come in uptil a familiar voice said, " Good&#xD;
evening, Miss Winthrop," and looking up she saw&#xD;
Mr. Lenox standing near her.&#xD;
" Why, Mr. Lenox !" said she, "how did you&#xD;
come in ?-e--I did ot hear a sound."&#xD;
"Not through the key-hole, or down the chim-&#xD;
ney ; the day for doing' such things in Massachu-&#xD;
setts is past, you .know ; but I found the house&#xD;
so silent that I almost fancied I had got into the&#xD;
wrong one. Are you lady hostess alone to-night ?"&#xD;
"Not lady hos ess, exactly. I was more selfishly&#xD;
occupied. Laur and I make a great many resolu-&#xD;
tions to read, an I have been trying .to carry out&#xD;
one single one of mine. Uncle has a headache and&#xD;
went to his room after tea. Aunt is with him, and&#xD;
Laura, I am so ry to say, Mr. Lenox-but if I-&#xD;
should go for he , I am afraid I should find her fast&#xD;
asleep. She was very tired to-night."&#xD;
Mr. Lenox had been standing near the fire oppo-&#xD;
site to Grace; h~e had' hardly listened to a word&#xD;

she said, he was so charmed with the picture she&#xD;
made in her ait's deeply-cushioned chair. The&#xD;
light from the tll wax candles fell on her shining&#xD;
hair and bright face. There was nothing studied&#xD;
in her attitude or in anythin  she said. It was&#xD;
God's gift of beauty, and simp e unaffected grace,&#xD;
that made her o lovely to loo upon, and. His gift&#xD;
of higher love which had kept pack the dark shad-&#xD;
ow of vanity and pride from sp oiling the fair tem-&#xD;
ple. Mr. Lenox's silence mad  Grace look up to&#xD;
meet his eyes,,o intently fixed upon her that the&#xD;
color came quickly .to her face, and she said, "I&#xD;
will go and see if the journey up-stairs did not&#xD;
wake Laura up if you will excuse me."&#xD;
"No," said he; "I cannot e cuse you, or allow&#xD;
you to call you  cousin. I do not wish to see her&#xD;
to-night; this ,pportunity to ee you alone is just&#xD;
what I have been seeking, to ell you what I am&#xD;
sure you must know already."&#xD;
He had cone nearer to her now, and Grace lis-&#xD;
tened to his words of strong pleading affection with&#xD;
a frightened, aching heart,; for weeks she had fear-&#xD;
ed that this hour would come' and she-how was&#xD;
she to meet it?&#xD;
Mr. Lenox was every thing she could ask, so far&#xD;
as this world goes, and the wonder to her had often&#xD;
been that a gentleman 'so accepted and flattered by,&#xD;
ladies generally, should'seek he so decidedly. She&#xD;
adnaired him nd enjoyed his society, and yet she&#xD;
could never think of him, except as a very pleasant&#xD;
friend, just as! he did Henry Marshall. .She had&#xD;
studiously -avodeed being alor e' within him, and he&#xD;
knew it; but le was none the less determined to&#xD;

win her. It was late when the interview closed.&#xD;
Mrs. Clark had come at the usual hour to put out&#xD;
the lights and shut the house; but quickly taking&#xD;
in how matters stood, she kept her own counsel&#xD;
and waited until the quiet shutting of the front&#xD;
door reminded her that she might again appear on&#xD;
the scene of action.&#xD;
Laura had awakened and wondered where Grace&#xD;
was; the fire was still burning and the light was&#xD;
not put out. She looked at her watch, and finding&#xD;
it so late was just going to look for her when she&#xD;
heard her come in and shut the door, so still that&#xD;
she evidently designed to disturb nobody.&#xD;
"Why, Grace !" said she, "do you know what&#xD;
time it is? I shall never leave you down-stairs&#xD;
alone again, if this is the way you are going to do."&#xD;
" I am sure I hope you will not," said Grace, as&#xD;
she threw herself on the bed and, covering her face&#xD;
with her hands, weptsuch bitter tears as she had&#xD;
never shed before.&#xD;
"What is the matter-what has happened ?" said&#xD;
Laura, really alarmed ".is father sick ?"&#xD;
"'No; it's Mr. Lendx."&#xD;
"Mr. Lenox sick ?" said Laura.&#xD;
"Oh, Laura! nobody is sick. Mr. Lenox has&#xD;
been here this evening, and I'm so sad and wretch-&#xD;
ed," and again sheawept convulsively.&#xD;
" Oh, that is it !" anda very clear light dawned&#xD;
into Laura's mind, " Wait until you have lived&#xD;
three years more. Have you refused Mr. Lenox,&#xD;
Grace ?"-&#xD;
"Yes; and he is angry with me, and he has been&#xD;
so kind ever since I knew him. He was willing to&#xD;

wait without ai answer, and le every thinggo on&#xD;
as before. I k  w that was no, best, and told him&#xD;
so; but he says he shall not consider himself an-&#xD;
swered until I ave waited two months. It is very&#xD;
foolish for him to prolong the matter. I'm sure I&#xD;
have considered it enough. I vish uncle need not&#xD;
know it."&#xD;
"I think he suspects the state of affairs now, but&#xD;
it is not necessary for him to k ow anything more.&#xD;
1 aln sure it would please him very much to have&#xD;
you marry Mr. Lenox. You #illnever do better;&#xD;
and if you do not. love Doctor Allerton, I cannot&#xD;
understand yo r indifference to him."&#xD;
"Please, Laura, do not speal4 of Doctor Allerton&#xD;
or anybody e e. I wish I could stay up.in this&#xD;
room and se only you for a hole month. I do&#xD;
not believe Aaie ever had so much trouble. She&#xD;
liked Sandford Ross and he li ed her. I think it's&#xD;
dreadful to bea young lady."&#xD;

not look after he fire and the light, you will have&#xD;
to cone to be  in the dark, a d ,that will not help&#xD;
anything, yo  now."&#xD;
Grace passed a wearisome night. Sometimes&#xD;
she would co trast the ease which wealth brings&#xD;
with the cars and toil of her mother's daily life.&#xD;
She knew sh couldenjoy the leisure which might&#xD;
be hers, and  en Mr. Lenox was such a pleasant&#xD;
friend. She really enjoyed his society. Why could&#xD;
she not accept what really. seemed to be a most de--&#xD;
sirable offer. Doctor Allerton was nothing to her;&#xD;
he had startle her by his unexpected proposition;&#xD;
while Mr. Lenox had given her timely warning.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC8310-00000117"/>&#xD;
232.,&#xD;
&#xD;
So Iar as she was concerned, the result was the&#xD;
same in both cases. The more she thought, the&#xD;
more perplexed .she grew, until at last, in a strong,&#xD;
fervent petition for help and stre' gth to Him who&#xD;
giveth wisdom to His children when they ask it,&#xD;
she let the urden go and fell asleep.&#xD;
The dayswhich followed were sadder than Grace&#xD;
had ever known, life seemed. to her so real and&#xD;
earnest. She thought of the time when she felt no&#xD;
responsibility about anything, when she just min-&#xD;
gled with all the joys and perplexities of home, and&#xD;
frolicked with the children, and went and came&#xD;
with Ernest, and had such a free, bounding world&#xD;
of happiness.&#xD;
Her position with Mr. Lenox was painful, he was&#xD;
so delicate in his attentions, doing just the things&#xD;
which she could not reject, and never presuming&#xD;
on any claim. He gave her no opportunity to be&#xD;
annoyed, and yet she felt that he held her to the&#xD;
promise of another interview. Things were in&#xD;
this way when one day about the middle of May,&#xD;
Colonel Winthrop handed Grace a letter to read.&#xD;
It was from Ernest. The vacancy which Colonel&#xD;
Winthrop had so long kept in view would occur&#xD;
the first of June. He had written to Ernest mak-&#xD;
ing the necessary arrangements, and informing him&#xD;
to come on a week before the time, to mike a visit,&#xD;
and get ready for his r'ew occupation. 'his letter&#xD;
was Ernest's acceptance, and announced his inten-.&#xD;
lion to be with them in a few days. Grace could&#xD;
hardly believe it possible that he was actually com.&#xD;
ing. To see him and talk with him would be al-&#xD;
most equal to going hme:&#xD;

"Now, Grate," said Laura, " I expect you will&#xD;
bid me good-bye for some days, until you have ex-&#xD;
hausted Ernes 's whole catalogue of news."&#xD;
The day hewas to come Grace watched and&#xD;
waited. At last, leaning over the balusters, she&#xD;
caught the sound of his well - known voice, and&#xD;
went down th stairs in most undignified haste to&#xD;
welcome him. Ralph smiled all over his face to&#xD;
" see Miss Grace so happy." And. Ernest felt that&#xD;
her fond greeting .was worth all the world to him&#xD;
just then. " hy, Grace, how you have changed !"&#xD;
said he, as he held her at arm's length, and sur-&#xD;
veyed her wit mingled love and pride.&#xD;
"Oh,. no !  have not changed, Ernest, only&#xD;
grown older. I'm going to be nineteen, sometime,&#xD;
and that is older than you used to be,".added she,&#xD;
laughing.&#xD;
Grace's styl of dress was so unlike that in which&#xD;
he had been accustomed to see her, that at first&#xD;
glance she see ed unlike herself. She looked old-&#xD;
er, more like  beautiful woman, than the thought-&#xD;
less girl he had always known rher. The' new&#xD;
scenes through which she had passed, and being&#xD;
obliged to ac on her own responsibility, had in-'&#xD;
sensibly developed her character.&#xD;
Ernest was cordially welcomed by the rest 'of&#xD;
the family. Colonel Winthrop smiled to see how&#xD;
happy Grace looked. " I knew it would be neces-&#xD;
sary for you to come in advance of anjy busine is&#xD;
arrangements,'' said he, ''for Grace must be satis-&#xD;
fied about Beechfo~rd before she can let you go."&#xD;
Grace had indeed a great many questions to ask.&#xD;
Annie had written her by Ernest, but her letter&#xD;

covered only a small part of her inq iries. She&#xD;
wanted to know every thing that had happened in&#xD;
her absence.&#xD;
Ernest had much to tell of his final c rming. "I&#xD;
missed you, Grace. I wanted you to h lp me over&#xD;
the difficulties; but then, perhaps, you h lped me as&#xD;
much being here. I should be almost faint-hearted&#xD;
without you, father will miss me, and mother's&#xD;
face looked so sad when I told, her good-bye, that&#xD;
my courage half failed me; but Charles is getting&#xD;
to be a big boy, an  Henry and Arthur are fast&#xD;
coming on. I did n t know that I lo ed the old&#xD;
farm so well until I eent over. it for the last time.&#xD;
It did not seem much like our journey with only&#xD;
the prospect of staying away two weeks."&#xD;
Grace understood it all, but she was too happy&#xD;
to think he had come to be where sh could see&#xD;
him perhaps every day, to allow him :o bed very&#xD;
despondent. She adked about every body but&#xD;
Doctor Allerton, and of him Ernest had much to&#xD;
say. "I feel greatly indebted to him for many val-&#xD;
uable suggestions," said he, "his teachings and. his&#xD;
society have been highly useful to me.  was sorry&#xD;
to leave him, but I ail glad Beechford has so val-&#xD;
uable a man in it.  do not expect to find many&#xD;
such men even in Bo ton."&#xD;
As the days of Ernest's visit wore on, Grace&#xD;
found herself no nea er the end of her conversa-&#xD;
tion with him. He old her how much they all&#xD;
missed her, and that mother had often s id she did&#xD;
not know that Grace flled so .large a place in the&#xD;
house.&#xD;
Colonel Winthrop would have offered Ernest a&#xD;
&#xD;
FIFTY YEARS AGO.&#xD;
&#xD;
235&#xD;
&#xD;
home in his amily if he had thought it the best&#xD;
thing for him. "Our hours do not suit the hours&#xD;
of business men," said he. "I want you. to.have&#xD;
no hindrance . You have a fine situation, and I&#xD;
expect you to fill it with fidelity. Come here every&#xD;
Sunday, and as often as. you find it convenient dur-&#xD;
ing the wee , but attend to your business first.&#xD;
You shall have a room which we will call yours,&#xD;
and a welcome always."&#xD;
Grace saw t once that, this was best, though it&#xD;
would have. rejoiced her heart to meet him every&#xD;
day.&#xD;
Ernest entered, upon his new duties in humble&#xD;
reliance on that Divine aid which had so effectual-&#xD;
ly kept him thus far on his way. Religion had&#xD;
become to him a living reality.; before he left his&#xD;
father's house he had publicly professed his faith in&#xD;
his Saviour. This had softened t e parting to his&#xD;
mather's heart; she could trust h r boy, when  e&#xD;
trusted his Saviour. The changes in his life was&#xD;
very great, but he was determined to meet it faith-&#xD;
fully; of course he had much to. learn, but he had&#xD;
all of the elements of success in his character.&#xD;
His uncle's recommendation and influence gave&#xD;
him a good foundation in the opinion of his em-&#xD;
ployers, and right manfully did he undertake the&#xD;
task.&#xD;
If he had loved and confided in his sister before,&#xD;
he found her doubly valuable now. Her clear&#xD;
views, and bright color gs, lifted him out of his&#xD;
sombre moods. He looked forward to the even-&#xD;
ings he would spend with her with a sense of rest,&#xD;
and through her he began to feel better acquainted&#xD;

more of a home look  She had found great relief&#xD;
in telling him of heri correspondence  ith Doctor&#xD;
Alleton, and her acquaintance with Mr. Lenox.&#xD;
He was "surprised and delighted at the former.&#xD;
"I used to wonder, Grace, that he never made&#xD;
many inquiries about you. I think you may feel&#xD;
yourself honored that he has chosen you for a cor-&#xD;
respondent. If I only knew half as .much as he.&#xD;

you here, too; but don't marry a man whom you&#xD;
do not thoroughly like, Grace."&#xD;
"I do like Mr. Lenox, but I do not want to&#xD;

marry any body ; you will be surprise when you&#xD;
come home to visit a few years from now, to find&#xD;

The green leaves, the budding flowers, and the&#xD;
singing birds told that.June had come, and changed&#xD;
the whole outward aspect of the goodly city.&#xD;
Laura's world was changing, too, for she had prom-&#xD;
ised Henry Marshall she would leave her father's&#xD;
house, and go to dwell with him. Her father and&#xD;
mother approved her choice, and Grace extended&#xD;
a right cousinly hand to one whom she had learned&#xD;
to esteem and respect. It seemed to be another&#xD;
link binding her to Mr. Lenox. Laura told her&#xD;
that it was the only thing wanting to make her&#xD;
happiness complete. Ernest was a great comfort&#xD;
to her. He made no attempt to influence her, nor&#xD;
was he greatly surprised, when, one evening in the&#xD;
early part of July, she told him, with more cheerful-&#xD;
ness than he had seen her have of late, that Mr. Lenox&#xD;
and herself could never be any more to each other&#xD;
than they  ere at present. The question was de-&#xD;
cided, and painful as their interview had been, she&#xD;
had been happier ever since. ,The result of; that&#xD;
decision was of greater importance than she could&#xD;
then comprehend. The -choice was hers, apd .she&#xD;
decided it as she wished.&#xD;

FIFTY YEARS AGO.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. Lenox was what the-world calls a brilliant&#xD;
match. What hindered. her from walking with&#xD;
him through the paths of ease and luxury which&#xD;
were his, and which her presence would have ad-&#xD;
orned ?&#xD;
Had she not been given to her Saviour in the&#xD;
very dawning of her existence, and had not fervent&#xD;
petitions gone up from the heart of her father and&#xD;
mother that she might be kept from temptation, and&#xD;
delivered from evil? Mr. Lenox's loves with his&#xD;
views of her faith, would have been a sn re, a vital&#xD;
hindrance to her earthly mission. So, walking free-&#xD;
ly in directed steps, she went on her way without&#xD;
him.&#xD;

1;ESULTS OF EARLY TRAINING.&#xD;
G RACE'S final decision in regard to Mr. Le-&#xD;
nox was a real disappointment to Henry&#xD;
Marshall. He was so happy himself, that h's cous-&#xD;
in's sadness oppressed him. Besides, he thought&#xD;
Grace so fitted to complete Mr. Lenox's character,&#xD;
he wondered she could not see how necessary she&#xD;
was to his uture life.'- Laura shared in' his grief.&#xD;
She wished now more than ever that her cousin&#xD;
had been prevailed on to stay without going home&#xD;
when she and Ernest came to visit them a year ago;&#xD;
then she would not have known Doctor Allerton,&#xD;
and though Grace did not acknowledge it, she was&#xD;
very sure he was the strong power which held her&#xD;
so firmly, and made her indifferent to Mr. Lenox's&#xD;
love, and the advantages which his position offered.&#xD;
Occasionally she would think she could not have&#xD;
it so; but her warmest remonstrances were met&#xD;
with so much sincerity, that she-ended with a con-&#xD;
viction that Grace acted from right principles, and&#xD;
there was no use in trying to influence her to do&#xD;
contrary to her inclinations in the matter. One&#xD;
thing she resolved she would do. She would cease&#xD;

to feel any interest in Doctor Allerton's 1Ktters. She&#xD;
was vexed at him, but she forgot it when the next&#xD;
one canie, and listened to it as she always did, and&#xD;
felt involuntarily drawn towards him as a personal&#xD;
friend. She was perplexed and vexed, and finally&#xD;
gave. the matter up: as something beyond her con-&#xD;
trol.&#xD;
Colonel Winthrop had been a close observer of&#xD;
the way things were 'going ever since Mrs. Mar-&#xD;
shall's party in the early winter. H  regarded&#xD;
Henry Marshall and Mr. Lenox as every way de-&#xD;
sirable matches for his daughter and niece.&#xD;
To have Grace so finely provided for, "set in&#xD;
the very niche she seemed made to fill,'' as he told,&#xD;
Mrs. Winthrop, was a matter for quiet  ongratula-&#xD;
tion. He kept his own counsel, and expected the&#xD;
satisfactory ending with certainty, when suddenly&#xD;
Mr. Lenox's frequent -visits were discontinued.&#xD;
After waiting long enough to assure  imself that&#xD;
somethin was wrong, he took an opportunity'&#xD;
when he was alone with Grace to ask, with as-&#xD;
sumed indifference, where Mr. Lenox was.&#xD;
Grace was conscious of blushing very deeply,&#xD;
and betraying a good deal of agitation; but she&#xD;
managed to reply, " We do not see him as often as&#xD;
we did in the winter."&#xD;
Suddenly stopping before her; he said, "Is Doc-&#xD;
tor Allerton in the way of your choice of Mr. Le-&#xD;
nox&#xD;
It was terrible for her to be thus questioned by&#xD;
her uncle.. With a beating heart, she only replied,&#xD;
" I do not think he is.",&#xD;
" Doctor Allerton is a gentleman ; I admired him,,&#xD;
&#xD;
but he has his own way to make, while - Mr. Lenox&#xD;
can place his wife in a home of ease and luxuy.&#xD;
The woman of his choice may feel herself honored.&#xD;
I should be sorry to have you act unwisely in this&#xD;
matter. Young people do not always know what&#xD;
is best for them."&#xD;
"I do not think-I am almost sure--" began&#xD;
Grace, but the seal of silence fell on her lips. She&#xD;
could not vindicate herself to him; he would not&#xD;
understand her. Besides, she was so overcome by&#xD;
his gentle ess, when she expected severity, that she&#xD;
could no trust herself to speak; and when she&#xD;
looked u he had gone without saying .another&#xD;
word.&#xD;
Her uncle had been her great dread. She ex-&#xD;
pected little less than. positive displeasure, if he&#xD;
ever knew it; but even he had uttered no, reproof.&#xD;
She knew she had disappointed him, and that was&#xD;
hard enough for her to bear.&#xD;
"I have gone contrary to the wishes of the dear-&#xD;
est friends I have outside of my home, and I cannot;&#xD;
cannot help it. Ernest thinks I have done right,&#xD;
and that is such a comfort."&#xD;
Ernest came just.then, and a long walk with him&#xD;
in the cool evening air refreshed and strengthened&#xD;
her spirits. She had need of these .lifts out of her&#xD;
daily life, for' besides the consciousness of her&#xD;
friends' disappointments, she had occasionally to&#xD;
meet Mr. Lenox. He endeavored to conceal his&#xD;
wounds froni observant eyes, but to one who knew&#xD;
him as she id, his bitterness was distressing. She"&#xD;
could not.show him the kindness she felt; and was&#xD;
greatly relieved when she learned through Henry&#xD;

Marshall that he would be absent on business for&#xD;
some weeks.&#xD;
The evening after he left, Henry Marshall&#xD;
brought her a note and a little sealed package.&#xD;
She excused herself, and went up-stairs. She&#xD;
opened the box, and found it containe  an exquis-&#xD;
ite gold watch, just the mate to Laura's. The note&#xD;
was from Mr. Lenox. The language was as kind&#xD;
as a brother's could have been. " If," said he,&#xD;
"you will accept and wear this, I shall regard&#xD;
it as a seal of friendship, and will promise you,&#xD;
with it for my token, that I will endeaor to culti-&#xD;
vate less of bitterness than I have known since my&#xD;
last interview with you. I am convinced of your&#xD;
sincerity, and shall not seek to chang your decis-&#xD;
ion. If you return this, I shall consider it a rejec-&#xD;
tion of a peace-offering, on your part to one who&#xD;
has great need of peace. Its acceptance cannot&#xD;
involve you in any trouble; its return will grieve&#xD;
and disappoint me." Grace took the beautiful&#xD;
little timekeeper in her hand ; it was something&#xD;
she should value-but ought she to keep it? Wear&#xD;
a watch which was a gift from Mr. Lenox, when&#xD;
she had rejected him! That did not coincide with'&#xD;
her views of things, and she laid it back in its vel-&#xD;
vet case. Then she took up the note and re-read it.&#xD;
Taking in view her whole acquaintance with him,&#xD;
and its results, was it right to reject this "peace-&#xD;
offering," as he had termed it? "It is beyond my&#xD;
power to decide, to-night," thought she; -"I mnust&#xD;
wait. One thing I do know: it cannot entangle&#xD;
me as Doctor Allerton's letters have done. It ohly&#xD;
says 'forget, and be friendly ;' while they are con-&#xD;

FIFTY YEARS AGO.        2&#xD;
&#xD;
stantly drawing me on with heir charming variety,&#xD;
all woven up with home and every body I know&#xD;

fession, as if somebody  ad heard her make it.&#xD;
Laura had told her ndt to .be gone long, for she&#xD;
wanted to practice some songs which Henry had&#xD;
brought. So she put the package and note into her&#xD;
drawer, and went down to the parlor. Henry gave&#xD;
her a searching look,.and she wondered how much&#xD;
he knew pf the contents of the 'parcel. When they&#xD;
.were alone, she gave the package and the note to&#xD;
Laura, without .saying a word. When she had&#xD;
read the' note, and admired. the beautiful gift, she&#xD;
listened to Grace's "What shall I do?" uttered in&#xD;
beseeching terms.&#xD;
" It seems to, me you had better keep it. You&#xD;
cannot return it at present, for Mr. Lenox has&#xD;
gone. I know he has suffered very much, from&#xD;
what He'ry has told me."&#xD;
"Does e know it ?"&#xD;
" es."&#xD;
"I am sorry; but I cannot help it. If-I thought&#xD;
it would really gratif him, and he could perfectly&#xD;
understand my moti es, I would keep it. It is&#xD;
beautiful; and if Ern st had' given it to me, I.&#xD;
should be in ecstacies over it. How strang it is,&#xD;
that the thing itself isn't the thing, after all."&#xD;
"I must repeat the same expression I have so&#xD;
often used. What a queer girl you are! You&#xD;
seem so old and so young-all mixed up together.&#xD;
Sometimes I should think I had your mother for&#xD;
my room-mate, and then I might believe your little&#xD;
sistw Mary had ;dropped in. I wonder if there is&#xD;

any thing in that old house at Beechf rd which&#xD;
makes people prematurely wise! I am glad you&#xD;
cannot send this beautiful thing back to-pight, and&#xD;
I am stronglydisposed to think, in view of all the&#xD;
circumstances, that you would do wrong to do soat&#xD;
all. Ask Dr. Allerton. I believe-he is accountable&#xD;
for some of your strange fancies, ignorant as you,&#xD;
seem to be of the fact. If he only lived in Bostcn&#xD;
in time I might learn to forgive him." .&#xD;
The world went on as usual; only to Grace life&#xD;
was more serious than it used to be.&#xD;
Henry Marshall had a long talk with Laura&#xD;
about his cousin and hers. He could not under-&#xD;
stand why she had refused him, but he never once&#xD;
accused her of seeking to mislead him. "She is a&#xD;
rare treasure," said he, "and' would, I think, have&#xD;
sufficient influence over Lenox to brink him into&#xD;
clearer view on some points ;where he is rather&#xD;
wandering. He is very fastidious in his tastes,&#xD;
and now I shall not be surprised if ht is never&#xD;
suited. I hope Grace will keep that watch."&#xD;
"Then you knew about it ?"&#xD;
"Yes ; he told me all about it. It se med, after&#xD;
his first sorrow had passed, to be a decided com-&#xD;
fort to him to express his continued regard in some&#xD;
way that might occasionally remind her of him.&#xD;
He proposed several .things, but nothing suited&#xD;
him until he saw a watch exactly like. fours. He&#xD;
could see no objection to this: it would be useful,&#xD;
and he was sure she could. accept it as a token of&#xD;
his continued friendship. He sent no chain with&#xD;
it, on purpose. He designed to have jno links in&#xD;

One evening, Grace had been sitting in the twi-&#xD;
light with Henry and Laura, when Ernest came&#xD;
for her to. go .out to walk. "Poor Lenox," said&#xD;
Henry, "I seldom see that girl, that I do not wish&#xD;
it had-been in her power to love him."&#xD;
"I wish it could have been so," said Laura. " It&#xD;
is a greater trial, since it is just what we would&#xD;
have it, if we could arrange it. It is a great dis-&#xD;
appointment to' father and mother, but they aston-&#xD;
ish me by their quietness about it. Mother says,&#xD;
father ,thinks she will change her mind; but I&#xD;
know she will not. She is a peculiar girl. She is&#xD;
one of the dearest companions you can imagine.&#xD;
She has done me a great deal of good. She always&#xD;
sees things in such a cheerful way. I' tell her&#xD;
sometimes I believe she was born to conquer diffi-&#xD;
culties. Right and wrong are very clearly defined in&#xD;
her mind, and, without seeming to know it, she&#xD;
brings one to her way of thinking."&#xD;
"Just the qualities Lenox needed. It is well he&#xD;
is not your listener. You would destroy all the&#xD;
effects of his change of scene and stoical determin-&#xD;
ation. I hope she will be wise enough 'to keep his&#xD;
watch. I'shall think her lacking in appreciating&#xD;
circumstances, if she does not."&#xD;
" I think she has decided to do so, for even Er-&#xD;
nest did not object."-&#xD;
"Her brother has decision enough to be your&#xD;

"Of course, if father and mother and all of the fam-&#xD;
ily were coming, I should feel very differently. If&#xD;
&#xD;
w e had always lived here as uncle has, I suppose&#xD;
I hould wonder how I could be content in Beech-&#xD;

" Unless-you know you asked me to explain,&#xD;
iss Winthrop, and I begin to feel quite an ability&#xD;

not scold and fret when she has .so much to "do,&#xD;
and how it is possible that we all seem so happy.&#xD;
One Sunday when she was not well, and I stayed at&#xD;

th r's religion seems himself. Is cannot separate&#xD;
hin from it, while uncle's seems like our Sunday&#xD;
clothes at home-the very best things we can have,&#xD;
but not absolutely necessary to our real comfort&#xD;
an happiness."&#xD;
'Uncle came away from home very early. Moth-&#xD;
er says he had so many temptations in the army,&#xD;
an his success in business was so uninterrupted,&#xD;
an  his wealth so abundant, that he had greater&#xD;
te ptations to 'feed on husks' than father. had in&#xD;
hi, self-denying life. I do not believe I shall ever&#xD;
forget the conversation I .had with mother about&#xD;
.a week before I came away. She made it so plain&#xD;
that earthly riches were dangerous possessions,&#xD;
and increased a' man's responsibility so much, that&#xD;
I am trying to keep to her motto of diligence. 'She&#xD;
marked this text: 'Seest thou a man diligent in&#xD;
his business, he shall stand before kings; he shall&#xD;
not stand before mean men.&#xD;
"Isn't it strange, Ernest, that the Bible has some-&#xD;
thing in it for every body's troubles. I think I am&#xD;
something like uncle. I have the greatest respect&#xD;
for it, but I never could see how mother could re-&#xD;
member so many passages that were exactly the&#xD;
thing you wanted. I remember once when I was&#xD;
a little girl, she sent me with some broth for old&#xD;
Bethia Newal, She seemed very glad to see me,&#xD;
and I thought I would do as I had read about good&#xD;
peop e doing when they visited the sick, repeat&#xD;
some comforting passage of Scripture; but the&#xD;
more I tried the more I could not think of a single&#xD;
one ; and finally, when she asked me if I could not&#xD;
tell her a little news to cheer her tup, I asked her&#xD;

&#xD;
if she knew about 'Joseph and his brethren.' She&#xD;
did not seem to know who they were, but she liked&#xD;
the story.&#xD;
"1This winter when I have been so really troubled&#xD;
and perplexed, all of a sudden up would come a&#xD;
text without my looking for it, and it would be&#xD;
just the thing I needed and make the way seem&#xD;
plainer. When you first came, Ernest, you said&#xD;
you thought I had grown older, and sometimes I&#xD;
think I have, for I feel so much more responsibility.&#xD;
than I used to when I knew that father and mother&#xD;
were thinking for me. I did not, trouble myself&#xD;
much about anything, but here it is different. I&#xD;
often find myself questioning the right and wrong&#xD;
of things which people do and say. I try to throw&#xD;
it off by saying they are older and a.great deal&#xD;
wiser than I am,.but that does'not satisfy nie. I&#xD;
know that mother's views are right and her texts&#xD;
mean just what they say."&#xD;
"It would make mother very happy if she knew&#xD;
that you remember these things. She used to say&#xD;
last winter, 'Grace is so young and thoughtless,&#xD;
and so. fond of things which please the eye, that&#xD;
I'm afraid she will get notions which will hinder&#xD;
her from being happy in the plain ways she has&#xD;
been accustomed to. If I only knew that she was&#xD;
a Christian, I could trust her better.' "&#xD;
"I am not a Christian, Ernest, I know I am not ;&#xD;
but my life has been so entirely different from ours&#xD;
at home, that I. have thought more of the difference&#xD;
between those who are. Christians ,and those who&#xD;
are not, than I should in years there, with father&#xD;
and mother and grandfather and grandmother. I&#xD;
&#xD;
had no contrasts for them. I thought, if I ever&#xD;
thought at all, that all "fathers and mothers were&#xD;
Christians."&#xD;
"Grace ! where are you ?" said Laura, coming&#xD;
out to look for her. "Henry has gone and Mrs.&#xD;
Clark is waiting for you to lock the hot se."&#xD;
"If I have outstayed Henry," said' Ejnest, rising&#xD;
quickly, "you must charge it to this cousin of&#xD;
yours,l who has a way of keeping folks longer than.&#xD;
they mean to stay. I'll take it off of my next even-&#xD;
ing," said 'he, laughing, as the girls followed him&#xD;
to the door and bade him good-night&#xD;

CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
THE BEACH PARTY.&#xD;
M    R. LENOX had     turned, and Grace had&#xD;
met him two or, three times. He was kind,&#xD;
but evidently avoided her. And she, understand-&#xD;
ing him, managed to keep out of his way.&#xD;
There was less necessity for their meeting now&#xD;
than during the winter. He did not call, and there&#xD;
were no parties to throw them together.&#xD;
"Mr. Rexford calls oftener than he used to ;&#xD;
have you thought of it, Grace ?" said Laura, one&#xD;
day.&#xD;
"Yes ; and do you know, Laura, that I am getting&#xD;
to be suspicious, or vain, or something else disagree-&#xD;
able, because instead of. enjoying 'his society as I&#xD;
used to last winter, I begin to imagine I shall get&#xD;
into trouble again. It is dreadful to be suspicious,&#xD;
Laura.".&#xD;
"I'm suspicious of Doctor Allerton's letters as&#xD;
the occasion of a good deal of your trouble. Why&#xD;
don't you give them up ?'"&#xD;
Grace blushed, and answered, with some diffi-&#xD;
culty for her,. "How can I now? Ernest likes&#xD;
them as well as I do. Annie is so busy, she has n't&#xD;
time to write-us half we want to know."&#xD;

&#xD;
"Well, I advise Mr. Rexford not 'waste his&#xD;
veetness on the desert air.'"&#xD;
" He shall not, if I can help it," said Grace.,&#xD;
A long silence followed, in which both girls were&#xD;
idently thinking. Laura, looking up, saw such&#xD;
serious expression on her cousin's face, that she&#xD;
immediately called her to an account for it.&#xD;
"Taking yourself to task, I always know, when I&#xD;
e that expression. What have you been doing&#xD;
ow ?"&#xD;
"It's what I have n't been doing. I've been con-&#xD;
asting my life with Annie's. Sometimes I feel so'&#xD;
le-just as if I was doing nobody any good."&#xD;
"How glad I am that I feel so well qualified to&#xD;
nsweri some of your doubts. , In the first place,&#xD;
ou have been teaching me ever since you came&#xD;
ere, Do n't look so incredulous, Miss Winthrop !&#xD;
'he lessons you hare given me I could never have&#xD;
:arned in any othe way ; and if I should attempt&#xD;
draw up a set o1 resolutions, you would be as-&#xD;
nished at their extent."&#xD;
Grace did look incredulous, forthe idea of being&#xD;
y real benefit to Laura never came into her&#xD;
cad ; and that very evening, when Ernest told her&#xD;
was a- subject 9f daily thankfulness to. him that&#xD;
be was where he could tell, her of his perplexities,&#xD;
ad that her sympathies made hi.m.stronger for his&#xD;
ew mode of life, a light seemed to-dawn upon her.&#xD;
erhaps Ernest had ;needed her more than her&#xD;
iothey and Annie had.. How she. had- helped&#xD;
aura, she - could not tell; but she was very glad&#xD;
Sat slie-had not been living :for herself only. Fr-&#xD;

and make friends who would esteem him, and then&#xD;
he could do without her better. She was sorry&#xD;
there seemed so little that she could do to show&#xD;
her affection for her uncle and aunt. She did not&#xD;
know that her bright, cheerful face, and her thought-&#xD;
ful anticipations in little acts of dutiful, attention,&#xD;
made him wish that she might never leave him un-&#xD;
til she had a home of her own. He had been real-&#xD;
ly tried in her refusal of Mr. Lenox. If the matter&#xD;
had been reversed, and she. had fancied some one&#xD;
whom he disliked,. he would never have kept so&#xD;
quiet; but he could not see how any interference&#xD;
on his part would help the state of things.&#xD;
"That young doctor at Beechford has something&#xD;
to do with her decision," was his-usual response to&#xD;
himself, when he thought the matter over. He&#xD;
made very particular inquiries after him of Ernest,&#xD;
and found that he held him in high esteem. He&#xD;
was making his mark, and promising to be a man&#xD;
of much importance at Beechford. He poped&#xD;
nothing would be said of Grace's going home for&#xD;
another year'; perhaps in that time things would&#xD;
take a different turn.&#xD;
Mrs. Winthrop had gone beyond loving  race&#xD;
because her husband and daughter did. She loved&#xD;
her because she could not help it. Her fingers had&#xD;
a kind of. magnetic touch which soothed her fre.&#xD;
quent headaches more than medicine ; anc now&#xD;
that Laura had so many exclusive demands upon.&#xD;
her, Grace filled in the vacancy most acceptably.&#xD;
She thought if her mother should send for her, a&#xD;
visit would satisfy her, and she would consent to&#xD;
her returning with them for another year at least.&#xD;
&#xD;
s I&#xD;

She 10lt more sure of it now that Ernest was there,&#xD;
for she knew that he would not be willing to have&#xD;
her o away, if it was possible to keep her. Grace&#xD;
had been trained in active usefulness; so that she&#xD;
did, ot really understand or' rightly estimate the&#xD;
passive form. There are so many departments in&#xD;
the great work-shop of life, that it needs time and&#xD;
severe discipline to open our eyes to the fact that&#xD;
our a customed way is -only one.of the infinite ways&#xD;
in which the workman is employed.. We cannot&#xD;
judg of the importance of our task simply by its&#xD;
relative position. Grace was standing - on the&#xD;
thres old, with only. a dim perception of what was&#xD;
folde up in the leaves she was daily turning.&#xD;
" 'other told m two years ago that I knew very&#xD;
little of life," said. he to Laura. "I thought she&#xD;
had very limited idea of my attainments,.but' I&#xD;
begi to see'that she was wiser than her daughter.&#xD;
[ think I have learned something in these two&#xD;
years Ernest say I seem older than I used to;&#xD;
but, good-bye, there comes Henry Marshall; if he&#xD;
s really disappointed at not. finding 'me here,' you&#xD;
an call me," and lughingly she ci sappeared. In a&#xD;
ittle time, Laura came for her.&#xD;
"According to agreement, I am here to find&#xD;
rou. Henry wishes to see you especially."&#xD;
"I oppose so," aid Grace, without showing the.&#xD;
east ign of obeying the summons.&#xD;
" He does, really I. came on purpose to find you.&#xD;
If you had been a little less anxious 'to be out of&#xD;
he way, I should not have had to come up these&#xD;
ong fights of stairs."&#xD;
Henry was in the summer-house, which was&#xD;

"My call at this hour was on purpose to see you,&#xD;
Grace ; but, as usual, you were out of sight. I am&#xD;
going to get up a beach party, and my first ques-&#xD;
tion is, what shall I do with you ?"&#xD;
" If Ernest can go, I will quickly tell you. Will&#xD;
it do for him to leave his business ?"&#xD;
"Better not until he has been there lodger.&#xD;
Laura says you must be talked, over and disposed&#xD;
of before hand, or you will give us a great deal of&#xD;
trouble."&#xD;
"Quite a compliment !" said Grace, laughing.&#xD;
"I'll stay with aunt, and after dinner ride over to&#xD;
Charlestown, call and invite Mr. Ernest Winthrop&#xD;
to tea, and be ready to welcome you home hen*&#xD;
you-come.".&#xD;
"Exactly what I said!" responded Laura. 'But&#xD;
you must* go, Grace; I want you to very much.&#xD;
We are to go early in the morning, take lunch with&#xD;
us, and eat it on the rocks. It will be delightful,&#xD;
if you will only do as.we want you to."&#xD;
"What do you want me to do.?"&#xD;
" Go with whoever of Henry's friends ask.you.'&#xD;
"Not Mr. Lenox! You would not approve of&#xD;
that, Henry, I am sure."&#xD;
"No, Grace; Lenox believes in you; he will not&#xD;
ask you. .I hope he will go;. but if he does, it will&#xD;
be on horseback. . The truth is, if you are disen-&#xD;
gaged, Rexford will ask you. He is a'good fellow ;&#xD;

you to spend much, time over him. You have&#xD;

"Say, 'Yes,' before he asks me-is that what you&#xD;

Grace, laughing.&#xD;

" Yes, to please you and Laura I will, if you&#xD;

"I must, if you do not; remember you are to&#xD;
leave your fate in my hands, so far as this party is&#xD;
concerned."&#xD;
" Yes, sir," said Grace, making a low' courtesy,&#xD;
and then she was gone back to her room, where&#xD;
.Laura soon joined her,-and their talk and work&#xD;
went on uninterruptedly for the rest of the morn-&#xD;

The party was arranged for the last day of Au-&#xD;

seemed decidedly surprised that somebody had&#xD;

fact, that he cared particularly for any young lady,&#xD;
urged him to make some other arrangement  He&#xD;
must not stay at home for they could not spare&#xD;
him.&#xD;
Six o'clock is a very pleasant hour to start on a&#xD;
long ride of a warm summer morning.     rnest&#xD;

came up to see them off and join was a verypleash&#xD;
that he was going. Mr. Russell waavey Pleas-&#xD;
ant companiongand the whole party were in excel-&#xD;
lent spirits. Without driving fast they rached&#xD;
Lynn before nine o'clock, and after resting at hour&#xD;
were ready to drive to the beach. Here they stroll-&#xD;
ed about, watching the play of the good-ntured&#xD;
waves. They climbed the rocks and found sats as&#xD;
they could in groups or single companies. Every&#xD;
body had come for a pleasant day, so they wer social&#xD;
and merry, enjoying the refreshing breeze . Mr.&#xD;
Lenox came much later than the rest, and as Henry&#xD;
Marshall had predicted, he was on horsebac. He&#xD;
was cheerful, but not a leading spirit, as he once&#xD;
would have been. He joined the group where&#xD;
Grace was sitting, and occasionally addressed a&#xD;
Grark was her nce he asked her about her broth-&#xD;
er and of his success in his business, but he offered&#xD;
her none of those little attentions which  ad al-&#xD;
ways before seemed a part of his nature..&#xD;
Lunch was in thiscase really an enterta nment,&#xD;
for it not only ministered to their appetites, but its&#xD;
arranging nd serving furnished a good  eal of&#xD;
amusement    Cold, roast chickens were plenty,&#xD;
and sandwiches and a variety of cake and fruit.&#xD;
Each carriage had a basket, and altogether the&#xD;
&#xD;
FIFTY YEARS AGO.      .    261&#xD;
good things would have been sufficient for a party&#xD;
of twige their number.&#xD;
The repast occupied some time, and then Lizzie&#xD;
Marshall proposed to explore among .the rocky&#xD;
cliffs. Grace joined her, and in ashort time all of&#xD;
the party were in motion. Grace was very inde-&#xD;
pendent in her efforts, climbing rocks was no new&#xD;
thing for her, it really was very exhilarating; and&#xD;
brought a glow on her cheeks such as they used to&#xD;
wear at Beechford. She was quite in advance of&#xD;
the others and thought she was a one, making a&#xD;
bold effort to go round a point she missed her foot--&#xD;
hold and would have fallen if a str ng hand had&#xD;
not caught her, and held her firmly until she stood&#xD;
in safety. It was Mr. Lenox. She had come into&#xD;
his .lonely retreat very unexpectedly. ~His sur-&#xD;
prise, and her sudden danger, threw him off his&#xD;
guard, and caused him to utter an expression of&#xD;
passionate tenderness. His quick apology had&#xD;
something so painful in it, that as he turned away&#xD;
and left her with Mr. Russell, she realized how man-&#xD;
fully he had striven to 'keep his pledge, and be to&#xD;
her only.a friend.&#xD;
Henry Marshall and Laur coming up just then,&#xD;
found Mr. Russell and several others assiduous in&#xD;
their inquiries after Grace, who was sitting, unusu-&#xD;
ally, pale, but very quiet, on the rock.&#xD;
"Your cousin, Miss Winthrop, came very near&#xD;
paying dearly for -her independence. She is in-&#xD;
debted .to. Mr. Lenox's sudden appearance from&#xD;
somewhere for her ability to look .so composedly&#xD;
over it now. She so outstripped me;-in, the race&#xD;
that I could render her- no assistance."&#xD;

Laura looked alarmed, but Grace assured, her&#xD;
that she did not fall, only a stone rolled and  ade.&#xD;
her lose her footing, she was not hurt in the le st.&#xD;
"I shall have to put an injunction on    iss&#xD;
Grace, to the effect that she shall stay d wn&#xD;
where the rest of us mortals do for the remai der&#xD;
of the day," said Henry Marshall, with an ai of&#xD;
assumed authority. " I also propose that we ave&#xD;
a little music on this festive occasion, provid d I&#xD;
can get our forces together."&#xD;
Grace would rather have sat awhile in sil nce&#xD;
waiting for the shock, and the expression of Mr..&#xD;
Lenox's face, to pass away; but with her sual&#xD;
effort at self-command, she joined her voice vith&#xD;
the others. Mr. Lenox's part was wanting and&#xD;
there was'a general call for him, but he had disap-&#xD;
peared, and they were obliged to go on without&#xD;
him.&#xD;
The waves sang, too, regardless of the tiny&#xD;
sounds on shore ; the world was wide enoug  for&#xD;
both. By and sby the horses were brought an the&#xD;
party rode slowly up and down the wonde fully&#xD;
beautiful beach, watching the declining sun as it&#xD;
poured its farewell flood of golden radiance all&#xD;
over, the unmindful waters. The hard san  had&#xD;
retained sufficient water to give it the appearance&#xD;
of a high polish, and the tread of the horse was&#xD;
so soft, that they might have be n shod wit vel-&#xD;
vet for any sound they gave. G ace took i the&#xD;
beautiful outline with its varied sc nery from  each&#xD;
to lofty precipice, with intense longings for rnest&#xD;
to share in, er enjoyment of it. She was in no&#xD;
mood to express to Mr. Russell the half she felt,&#xD;
&#xD;
FIFT  YEARS AGO.           263&#xD;
so she kept reasonably silent:. The ride liome was&#xD;
very pleasant, the m on supplying the sun's place&#xD;
most acceptably.&#xD;
Grace's accidenta encounter with Mr. Lenox&#xD;
had been her greater t drawback in the pleasures&#xD;
of the day. He di not join the company any&#xD;
more. His cousin c vered his retreat, by saying,&#xD;
"He was an uncerta n guest, and had only prom-&#xD;
ised to ride out'and lok on awhile."&#xD;
Ernest was waitin for them, and listened with&#xD;
interest to Grace's d scription of the excursion.&#xD;

Grace knew that Ler mother really needed her,&#xD;
especially. if Annie was going. It was a great trial&#xD;
to leave Ernest, butl her mother .knew that, and&#xD;
. would not separate them if she cojild help it.&#xD;
The evening before Annie's letter came Mr..&#xD;
Rexford had found. an opportunity to convey to&#xD;
Grace in language sh could neither misunderstand&#xD;
nor evade his life pla for her.&#xD;
The interview, on her part, was less painful than&#xD;
the one with Mr. Lenox, because she had never&#xD;
come so near loving him; but, with the feelings&#xD;
of a true woman, she was pained to be tlle cause&#xD;
of disappointment and sorrow to one who so earn-&#xD;
estly offered her his ichest gifts. She had never&#xD;
given him reason to s pposeashe liked him beyond&#xD;
a .pleasant friend,. and when she grew conscious&#xD;
that he was advancing farther than this she had&#xD;
withdrawn, sometimes almost to coldness.&#xD;
"Another friend lost," said she, in answer to&#xD;
Laura's inquiries. "I am glad I am sure of Ernest&#xD;
and Henry Marshall."&#xD;
Her mother's desire for her to come home seemed&#xD;
an outlet for the troubles she had so unintentionally&#xD;
encountered.&#xD;
Related to Henry Marshall and Laura, as she and&#xD;
Mr. Lenox were, they must meet occasionally, and&#xD;
when winter came it would be impossible to avoid&#xD;
meeting often. Every thing would be changed.&#xD;
Mr. Rexford belonged to their musical set and to&#xD;
all their social gatherings. It would be impossible&#xD;
to get back the old, careless friendship  New&#xD;

a&#xD;
&#xD;
seemed strange that in one short year she should&#xD;
have become so much at home in her uncle's&#xD;
family and have so many pleasant friends who re-&#xD;
gretted he going. Mrs. Winthrop felt personally&#xD;
aggrieved she did not trysto be reconciled to it.&#xD;
Ernest made the. best of it, but he dreaded the&#xD;
vacancy which her going would leave. The last&#xD;
of October Mr. Olcott, Colonel Winthrop's friend,'&#xD;
came, and willingly promised to see his young&#xD;
charge in safety until she met her father.&#xD;
. The little trunk was brought down from the&#xD;
attic, but its owner's wealth had so outgrown .its&#xD;
size that the large one Mrs. Winthrop had brought&#xD;
from New York had to take its place.&#xD;
"Shall I take these handsome evening dresses,&#xD;
aunt ?" said she, as she thoughtfully surveyed&#xD;
them, and remembered that they would be rather&#xD;
out of place in their little .social gatherings at&#xD;
Beechford.&#xD;
"Yes, child, take every thing; they will be old-&#xD;
fashioned when you come back next winter. You&#xD;
will want new ones then."&#xD;
It seemed to Grace that her wardrobe was very&#xD;
extensive. She thought her mother and Annie&#xD;
would think so too.&#xD;
" Here is something for Annie," saii Mrs. Win.&#xD;
throp, handing her a parcel. "Tell her I do:not&#xD;
like her getting married and taking you away ;&#xD;
but I will forgive her enough to send-Fer this."&#xD;
It was a silver-gray silk with the necessary trim.&#xD;
mings, and Grace added it ,to her store with great&#xD;
pleasure.&#xD;
Laura helped her pack. It was astonishing how&#xD;

wished he had never come to Beechford. It would&#xD;
have been a great relief to her burdened mind to&#xD;
pour out a torrent of wrathful words on his far off&#xD;
head just at that moment, but she was perfectly&#xD;
conscious that it would not do a particle of good,&#xD;
so he at once smothered it down and busied her-&#xD;
self with her cousin's trunk until she grew cheerful&#xD;
again.&#xD;
" I cannot wear this to-night; uncle would notice&#xD;
it, and I could never explain 'it to him. I hope&#xD;
you will tell Henry that I appreciate his beautiful&#xD;
gift. I shall wear the watch with more pleasure&#xD;
for his association with it."&#xD;
The last evening brought a good many calls.&#xD;
Mr. Lenox was among. the number, but Mr. Rex-&#xD;
ford was not. Mr. Lenox only staid a few mo-&#xD;
ments, but he. seemed cheerful, and told her good.-&#xD;
bye so kindly, that it vas pleasant to remember.&#xD;
She was glad he came; it seemed to quiet the&#xD;
painful recollection she had of her meeting hi  at&#xD;
Nahant. Colonel Winthrop spoke of her going as.&#xD;
of a visit she was making. ° "'If, nothing happens,&#xD;
I shall come. for you next year," he said.&#xD;
Ernest caught at this, idea, and wore a. more&#xD;
cheerful face than he had, for several days. As he&#xD;
was leaving for the night, his uncle said; " I saw&#xD;
Mr. Hillard this afternoon, and asked him to give&#xD;
you a holiday to-morrow. I want you'to drive&#xD;
about twenty miles from here with this young lady.&#xD;
Her baggage will go with Mr. Olcott, by the stage,&#xD;
and you can see her safely on board."&#xD;
This thoughtful kindness on the part of his uncle&#xD;
was so unexpected, that Ernest said goo-night&#xD;

with almost as light a heart as if h had been go--&#xD;
ing all the way.&#xD;
The November sun strove to gladden the earth&#xD;
and give a cheerful look to the stirring city, as Er-.&#xD;
nest and Grace once more drove cut of it. The&#xD;
parting was past; her going was regretted in the&#xD;
household, from her uncle down t Ralph. This&#xD;
ride with Ernest was a great help to them both.&#xD;
There was so much to say, that the were in dan-&#xD;
ger of being behind the stage-hour. Grace looked&#xD;
at her watdh, which she wore for the first time to-&#xD;
day, and found it was necessary t drive a little&#xD;
faster. Ernest had messages for is father and&#xD;
mother, Annie and all the rest, not forgetting Doc-&#xD;
tor Allerton. They reached the appointed place,&#xD;
a little in advance of the stage-coach. Mr. Olcott&#xD;
and the trunks were both along with it. The&#xD;
horses were changed, the horn blew, and Ernest&#xD;
saw his sis er seated, and watched the wave of her&#xD;
handkerchief until the vehicle was out of sight.&#xD;
With a lonely heart he turned away and drove&#xD;
back to Boston. This sister's love had been one&#xD;
of the strong daily influences of his life. How&#xD;
would he get on without it now? It was a slight&#xD;
hope that she might come back the next year. He&#xD;
tried to shut out the thought that he should never&#xD;
again belong to the home circle as one of its daily&#xD;
members. He must work on manfully. He had&#xD;
a place to ill, and he would not lse strength in&#xD;
useless regrets. So, with thankful memories for&#xD;
the treasures he had in such safe keeping, he went&#xD;
back to his duties. He had no fe:r of being for-&#xD;

CHAPTER       XX.&#xD;
B EECHFORD AGA I.I-&#xD;
MR. OLCOTT proved himself an excellent&#xD;
traveling companion. He was about Colo-&#xD;
nel Winthrp's age, and had daughters older and&#xD;
younger than Grace. Without naay delays, the&#xD;
lumbering old stage-coach, the da it was due,&#xD;
drove up. to the little inn at A  . The first&#xD;
face Grace saw was her father's. That dear face!&#xD;
how it beamed upon her, aid how tha hand clasped&#xD;
hers as it helped her from her seat ! Let those who&#xD;
have known a loving father's welcome understand&#xD;
how glad lher heart was. In a few moments, who&#xD;
should appear but Charles and Henry, grown taller,&#xD;
but smiling all over their happy faces!&#xD;
"I should think I had got hom," said Grace.&#xD;
"Did anybody else come with you ?'&#xD;
"No," said her father.  "Arthur and Mary&#xD;
wanted to. It would not have take much to have&#xD;
brought your mother and Annie, too ; but I thought&#xD;
four would be enough for one wagon."&#xD;
'Grace remembered to introduce her father to&#xD;
Mr. Olcott. He joined her in thanking him for his&#xD;
kindness, b the way, and then the tage rode off.&#xD;

"Is that big trunk you 's, Grace ?" said Charles,&#xD;
looking in amazement at the large one which the&#xD;
driver had set down beside the small one.&#xD;
Yes."&#xD;
"Whew !" says he. "They have big things in&#xD;
Boston, don't they ? What have you got in it ?"&#xD;
The boys .soon drove Fearnaught and Caesar&#xD;
round to the door, and, with their father's help,&#xD;
lifted the trunks into the wagon. They were very&#xD;
anxious to be on their way. They had so many&#xD;
questions to ask, they wanted their sister all to&#xD;
themselves.&#xD;
Deacon Winthrop had, of course, much to in-&#xD;
quire about her journey and of Ernest.&#xD;
The twenty miles were soon passed over. As&#xD;
the early twilight deepened into night, the '"oid&#xD;
house at home" came full in view.&#xD;
" Please stop at the corner of the garden, father,&#xD;
and let Grace go in -by herself," said Charles.&#xD;
Grace was quickly out of the wagon. and open-&#xD;
ing the gate, without making any noise, she went&#xD;
into the porch, and looked in the little window by&#xD;
the side of the door. Her mother and Annie were&#xD;
sitting . before the fire, in quiet expectancy, while&#xD;
Arthur and Mary had' gone to the window, for per-&#xD;
haps the tenth time in the' last five minutes. She&#xD;
lifted the latch,  and in a moment her arms were&#xD;
about her mother's neck.&#xD;
"Gracel my. dear child, have you indeed co e !"&#xD;
Then the mother cast a longing look beyond her,&#xD;
as if Ernest must not be far away:,. Annie, Arthur&#xD;
and Mary all gathered round her, full' of rejoic&#xD;
ings. Deacon Winthrop and the two boys came&#xD;
12*&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC8310-00000138"/>&#xD;
in to see how she really looked a&#xD;
more.&#xD;
She had pictured just this meeting&#xD;
times during her absence. For the fi&#xD;
journey her thoughts had lingered&#xD;
ton friends, but as.she drew nearer h&#xD;
come before her and made her anxio&#xD;
with them.&#xD;
"Just look at this monstrous tru&#xD;
said Charles, as he helped bring in&#xD;
"I think Grace is as fine as Aunt&#xD;
La ra. Henry and I went out of si&#xD;
heard the stage coming. We wante&#xD;
her, and when we saw father helpin&#xD;
thought Cousin Laura must have&#xD;

"I think she is handsomer than'&#xD;
Henry. " I did not think she w&#xD;
When I used to see her every day, p&#xD;
thought any thing about it; but nd&#xD;
is very handsome. Don't you, moth&#xD;
We all love her so much; she lo&#xD;
to us,'' said the quiet, thankful mother&#xD;
ped briskly about, preparing tea.&#xD;
make haste, now, for father is hungry&#xD;
Grace will care more for something&#xD;
have us compliment her good looks.&#xD;
Annie, meantime, had taken her s&#xD;
and - cloak, and drawn-a chair close&#xD;
her. Mary, as of old, seated herself&#xD;
Arthur stood with his arm aroundhe&#xD;
'"Promise us you will never go&#xD;

Nobody tells us any stories now, for mother and&#xD;
Annie never have any time."&#xD;
"Tea is ready," said Charles, and the announce-&#xD;
ment wasfolloweci by a general gathering into the&#xD;
warm kitchen.&#xD;
"It does not loo much like your uncle's dining-&#xD;
room," said Mrs. Winthrop.&#xD;
"It looks very much like my ,old home," laid&#xD;
Grace, "and you look very much ,like the dear&#xD;
good mother I have always seen sitting at the head&#xD;
of the table."&#xD;
There was a hush, and from the earthly father's&#xD;
heart there went up to the heavenly Father a sim-&#xD;
ple petition for a. renewed blessing on every fresh&#xD;
token of His love. Grace had heard nothing like-&#xD;
it since she left that table morethan a year ago.&#xD;
"Ernest's seat seems very empty to-night," said.&#xD;
Mrs. Winthrop; "it seemed as if he must be com-&#xD;
ing with you, Grace."&#xD;
" I think mother is almost as much disappointed&#xD;
as if he had not come home with you two years&#xD;
ago," said Annie, trying to be cheerful over it. 'I&#xD;
am so glad to get one of you back that I feel like&#xD;
rejoicing."&#xD;
"So do I," said Mrs. Winthrop. "I am; sure&#xD;
Grace knows that well enough."&#xD;
Just as the tea was over, Aunt Loi slowly o en-&#xD;
ed the kitchen door and looked cautiously in.&#xD;
Grace saw her in a moment, and welcomed her as&#xD;
cordially as her kind heart could desire.&#xD;
"Wall, you've come, and I'm about as glad as I&#xD;
know how to be. I told Nannie that I must run&#xD;
over if it was dark. She's'got a dreadful cold, and&#xD;

her ancient head-gear an extra smooth. "We've&#xD;
d a pretty=lonesome, time since you and Ernest&#xD;
ent away. I hope you'll stay to home now, as&#xD;
g as I live, at any rate."&#xD;
"Oh, yes !" said Grace. "I'm going to stay at&#xD;
me as long as mother will keep: me, and I will&#xD;
ake you and Aunt Nannie some new caps ; and&#xD;
ext Spring you and I will have nicer flower-beds&#xD;
an we have ever had."&#xD;
By this time Aunt Lois .had blown out the bit of&#xD;

d set it down behind the door.&#xD;
"I'll take care of the dishes, Mis' VWinthrop. I&#xD;

Ernest came from Boston, that Grace felt strangely&#xD;
lonely; but she cheered herself and them by telling&#xD;
all about his coming to her uncle's; of his success,&#xD;
and her uncle's satisfaction in finding how well he&#xD;
pleased his employers. She had a very attentive&#xD;
audience,,for the letters had told so little compared&#xD;
with their wish to know so much of all that con-&#xD;
cerned him.&#xD;
Though Grace was talking, she had time to look&#xD;
about her; it seemed strange that the rooms had&#xD;
grown so small and the ceilings so low. She was&#xD;
lure they could not always have been so, and yet&#xD;
everything was just as she had left it. Her moth-&#xD;
er's face, in the fpint light which fell upon it, looked&#xD;
weary and care-worn, and she felt th t it would&#xD;
have been wrong for her to have stayed away when&#xD;
she might lighten some of the burdens at home.&#xD;
Her father looked quietly glad, and the children&#xD;
seemed so deligl ted to see her that she knew they&#xD;
must have missed her sadly.&#xD;
"Well," said Deacon Winthrop, as the clock&#xD;
struck ten, "we are no nearer through being glad&#xD;
to see Grace, or coming to the end of her stories,&#xD;
than we were when she first came in, so I propose&#xD;
we shall go to bed and.take a fresh day for the&#xD;
rest."&#xD;
Charles had taken Ernest's place in. reading the&#xD;
chapter, and when Grace heard her father's prayer&#xD;
for the absent brother, she realized how fervently&#xD;
she had been remembered all the days she had&#xD;

b'en. away. She went up to her room, so plain,&#xD;
c spared to the one she had occupied the past&#xD;
year, impressed with the feelings that her father&#xD;
and mother were very dear possessions, and that&#xD;
their presence in the old house would make up for&#xD;
t1 e lack of beauty there. Her mother's weary face&#xD;
tro ubled her, and she waited for Annie to come to&#xD;
ask if she was well.&#xD;
"Yes," said Annie; " but I think she has had too&#xD;
much to do all summer. When we talked of your&#xD;
coming home, and uncle wrote that letter, she&#xD;
hardy knew what to say. She really needed you&#xD;
so much, and yet she was sorry to send for you,&#xD;
whe they were all so unwilling to have you come,&#xD;
especially when your coming would leave Ernest&#xD;
alone."&#xD;
"You mean especially when you were going to&#xD;
run away and leave her. I don't know as I shall&#xD;
c sent to that."&#xD;
"Did Ernest, tell you I was going ?".&#xD;
"Yes; I do not want you to go, Annie; I shall&#xD;
m ss you very much ; I dread to think of it."&#xD;
"I thought you would bestised to it by this time.&#xD;
What is this ?" said she, suddenly attracted by the&#xD;
glitter of the chain which' had -been concealed By&#xD;
her dress. Grace took it from her, neck and placed&#xD;
it and the watch in her sister's hand.&#xD;
" Is this yours?" and "Who gave it to you ?"&#xD;
were questions which quickly followed each other.&#xD;
" It is mine, Annie, and some time I will, tell you&#xD;
all about it, I must tell you and mother, for I can-&#xD;
not enjoy having it without I do; but I do not.&#xD;

FIFTY YEARS AGO.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mary made up her lost opportunity by waking&#xD;
very early in the morning. She had a'great many&#xD;
things ,to tell her sister ; among others, that she&#xD;
met Doctor Allerton the afternoon before and told&#xD;
him that father and the boys had gone for her.&#xD;
" He and I are great friends," said she. Annie&#xD;
looked in to see if they were awake. "Must I&#xD;
come down and set the table ?" said Grace, laugh-.&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
If you are ready' to come down when it is ret,&#xD;
we will excuse you from anything else this morn-&#xD;
ing," said Annie.&#xD;
Grace was ready and received .a most hearty&#xD;
welcome as she toolk her old place. "I must go&#xD;
up. and see grandfather and grandmother this&#xD;
morning," said she. 1                  .&#xD;
" Before you open your big trunk? I was going&#xD;
to stay at home from school on purpose to see&#xD;
what is in it," said Mary, looking very much dis-&#xD;
appointed.&#xD;
"Perhaps mother will let you go with me to&#xD;
grandfather's, and that will do as well, won't it ?"-&#xD;
Mary's face bright tened ; she was ready 'to ac-&#xD;
company her sister on her. morning visit. The&#xD;
first thing was to look into the little brown house&#xD;
and say, 4"How do-do," to the loving old inmates.&#xD;
Aunt Nannie seemed more feeble, but Aunt Lois&#xD;
said it was only her dreadful cold ; she would get&#xD;
well right away when she saw Grace sitting in her&#xD;
old corner again. " Nobody knows how we've&#xD;
missed you," said she ; " I had n't no heart for any&#xD;
thing last spring. Mary, here, set away with me&#xD;
to gather wild flowers, but she soon got tired of it,&#xD;
&#xD;
FIFTY YEARS AGO.           28.1&#xD;
and my pinks and sweet Williams and roses hung&#xD;
on for days with nobody to make urn into flower-&#xD;
pots. I told Nannie last. night that I was dreadful&#xD;
'fraid I should ear by and by that somebody was&#xD;
coming to take ou back to Boston to live."&#xD;
"No, Aunt Lois," said Grace, "I shave come&#xD;
back to help yo  'look after things.' You need&#xD;
not be afraid of losing me-it is Annie we are go-&#xD;
ing to lose. Mother and you could not spare us&#xD;
both."&#xD;
Aunt Lois wa a little comforted, but she could&#xD;
not quite believe, a she told Nannie, that Boston&#xD;
folks would let such  beautiful " garl" as that come&#xD;
back to Beechford if they could help it.&#xD;
Grace found er grandfather and grandmother&#xD;
looking not a day older than when she left'them.,&#xD;
The same restful, sunny old people, waiting for the&#xD;
ummnons which would transplant them to their&#xD;
heavenly home.&#xD;
They were delighted to see their granddaughter,&#xD;
and had many questions to ask after Ernest. "We&#xD;
miss the dear boy," said the old gentleman, wip-&#xD;
ing hid eyes. "I wish he could have found some&#xD;
thing to, do nearer home, but it does me good to&#xD;
see your face again. I was afraid, from what they&#xD;
told me, that your uncle would think he had a&#xD;
right to you."&#xD;
"Your mother has missed you, my child," said&#xD;
her grandmother, "and I am glad you have come&#xD;
back to her."&#xD;
The visit lasted until after dinner, and then, with&#xD;
blithe little lMary for her companion, she wenit&#xD;
back through the same path she so well remem&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC8310-00000142"/>&#xD;
bered the day before she left home. The' walec&#xD;
and the call had done her good.&#xD;
The trunks were opened, and Mary's wonder-&#xD;
ing eyes feasted or their contents. Ahnie was&#xD;
very much' pleased  ith her. dress. "It is some-&#xD;
thing I needed, but ever thought of having," said&#xD;
she.&#xD;
Mary's remark's over her sister's dresses were.&#xD;
most original and amusing. She was sure nobody&#xD;
in the world ever looked half, so pretty as she&#xD;
must have done in these beautiful things.&#xD;
Grace folded and carefully laid away her white&#xD;
silk, her pink crape and her soft, India muslins-&#xD;
they already began to seem to her things of the&#xD;
*past. . Then, she produced the garments she had&#xD;
made for Annie.&#xD;
"A whole set ! Why, Grace, such unexpected&#xD;
riches. will turn mf head !" and she sat down,&#xD;
hardly knowing whether to laugh or to cry.&#xD;
"You must thank Aunt Winthrop a d Laura. I&#xD;
nly made them; it as one of my greatest pleas-&#xD;
res last winter. Here is Ernest's gift. He told&#xD;
e to tell you he had had only one payment, so he&#xD;
ould not buy just What he wanted to"&#xD;
Annie untied the package and found a beautiful&#xD;
collar and a pair ofwhite gloves. '1 And here is&#xD;
omething to pin ypur collar with f om Laura ;"&#xD;
nd Grace handed her a little box containing a&#xD;
yery pretty breast-pin, the like of which Annie had&#xD;
never owned.&#xD;
"Do call mother, Mary," said Annie. '"I am&#xD;
so overpowered with my sudden wealth that I can-&#xD;
not xnve."&#xD;
&#xD;
Mother came, and smiled, in, her loving way, to&#xD;
see her daughters so happy.&#xD;
Mary had some useful remembrances, too. Her&#xD;
heart was bubbling over in its joy. First it was&#xD;
Grace, then it was her beautiful clothes, then it&#xD;
was Annie's fine things, then it was her own.&#xD;
It took Grace some weeks to get back into her&#xD;
old routine of home duties. Sometimes they seem-&#xD;
ed wearisome to her, but her love for her home&#xD;
and friends helped her over these points; and, as&#xD;
her old interests came back, she entered on her&#xD;
daily life with increasing desire to meet the de-&#xD;
mands upon.her.&#xD;
The second evening after ,her return she came&#xD;
into the sitting -room and found Doctor Allerton&#xD;
there talking with her father. She was conscious&#xD;
of blushing deeply at this unexpected 'meeting,&#xD;
and making a wrong answer to his pleasant greet-&#xD;
ing, but he did not seem to notice it, He was self-&#xD;
possessed as usual. He placed a chair for her near&#xD;
the fire, and began asking her of her journey and&#xD;
of Ernest.&#xD;
The mention of Ernest seemed to restore her&#xD;
quiet tone of thoughts. She delivered, his mes-&#xD;
sage, and spoke of her regret at leaving him.&#xD;
Then followed'a pleasant conversation, easily main-&#xD;
tained. She did not feel afraid of him, neither did&#xD;
he seem so near her father's age as she had im-&#xD;
agined him to be. His easy flow of choice lan-&#xD;
guage had not, in the least, diminished; and, on&#xD;
the whole, she passed the first dreaded interview&#xD;
with less embarrassment than she had anticipated.&#xD;
His letters seemed to her iiow a part of her Bos-&#xD;

the fact that, in s me way, she un erstood and&#xD;
appreciated him m re than she used o, she would&#xD;
almost have believed 'that they had never been&#xD;
written.&#xD;
Annie expressed astonishment at er sociability&#xD;
with Doctor Allert n. She really belieyed she had&#xD;
grown older since she had been, away. So all of&#xD;
her friends said-nit less cheerful, but more digni-&#xD;
fied and womanly:&#xD;
The year had, indeed, been an evbntfuil one to&#xD;
her ; one-in which 'er character had developed rap-&#xD;
idly. Charles persisted in saying that she had grown&#xD;
handsome, and nore of her friends  ere disposed&#xD;
to contradict him.  Charlie Thorn and Edward&#xD;
Nelson declared that she had grow  just a little&#xD;
haughty, but that was only because they did not&#xD;
understand the change.&#xD;
She was no longer the light-hearted, thoughtless&#xD;
girl they had known all of their lives but she was&#xD;
justas good a friend.  Sandford ,oss playfully&#xD;
told her that it was Annie's mantle of eldest daugh-&#xD;
tership falling on her that impressed er so much.&#xD;
She found the old church as muc changed as&#xD;
her father's house. It had grown so small and&#xD;
plain. It seemed to her, as shesat n her seat in&#xD;
the choir, that one could almost shake hands across&#xD;
the galleries.&#xD;
Her good, common sense, made her keep all of&#xD;
these impressions to herself. Sometimes she would&#xD;
tell Charles, who was fast growing i sto her confi-&#xD;
dence, and who was highly amused a~ her descrip-&#xD;
tions;. but these ,thoughts quickly ~passed away,&#xD;
&#xD;
FIFTY YEARS ' AGO.&#xD;
&#xD;
285&#xD;
&#xD;
and she, " a natural branch," was soon at home in&#xD;
her "own olive-tree," realizing where her love. and&#xD;
duty lay. She told her mother and Annie the&#xD;
story of the watch. She could not wear it until.&#xD;
she had dole this. Mrs. Winthrop was heartily&#xD;
sorry for Mr. Lenox, but glad her daughter had&#xD;
come back to her.&#xD;
"I did not tell any body all the fears I had," said&#xD;
she. "If I had not been so afraid of loping you, I&#xD;
should have borne your absence better, but it has&#xD;
all come out right in the end."&#xD;
Grace did not mention Mr. Rexford, it was not&#xD;
necessary, neither had she told them of her corres-&#xD;
pondence with Doctor Allerton. She knew .how&#xD;
highly her- father aid mother esteemed him, and&#xD;
that he had done nothing of which they would&#xD;
not approve. Perhaps that was all past now, and,&#xD;
if it as, silence was its best keeper.&#xD;
The days were very busy ones, and Grace rmiss-&#xD;
ed Ernest every-where. Thanksgiving carne and&#xD;
went-a good, old festival, though Ernest was.not&#xD;
in it. Doctor Allerton spent the.evening at Deacon&#xD;
Winthrop's, and seemed quite at home in the&#xD;
family. His manner to Grace was deferential and&#xD;
friendly,-but nothing more.&#xD;
In writing to Ernest, she said, "Your friend&#xD;
Doctor Allerton was very polite' to mother, and&#xD;
made many inquiries about you. He treats me as&#xD;
if I was a strange lady-some distant connection&#xD;
of the family. I thought I might feel sorry for the&#xD;
obligation our correspondence would almost insen..&#xD;
sibly impose, but I might have spared myself, for&#xD;
he has evidently forgotten it."          ;&#xD;

mother's dishes and spoons were on duty, and her&#xD;
bright brass candlesticks, too. She had sent half a&#xD;
box of her nicest tallow candles, made on purpose&#xD;
for this occasion, and Grace had disposed ofther&#xD;
with an eye to effect. Aunt Lois had brought&#xD;
over a basket of dishes, out of a closet she ,seldom&#xD;
opened, except to brush away the dust, and Julia&#xD;
Thorn and Mary Ross had contributed from their&#xD;
households. They had also helped Grace tie ever-&#xD;
green wreaths for the walls and mirrors, and over&#xD;
the- high mantel-shelves. The new striped carpet,&#xD;
which Mrs.. Winthrop and Annie, with the help -of&#xD;
Aunt Nannie and Aunt Lois, had made duringtghe&#xD;
year, -h~d been .put on the .sittingeroom floor, and&#xD;
ave it 4 look of added warmth and cheerfulness.&#xD;
The bride was dressed and waiting., Her silver-&#xD;
rey silk was very becoming. Ernest's gift of col-&#xD;
ar and gloves, and Laura's pin, were just what-she&#xD;
eeded. Like Grace, she had soft, abundant hair.&#xD;

hoice wreath, one which she, had worn herself the&#xD;

in the way Laura so much loved to see it, and fast-&#xD;

Lois took possession of the kitchen, ith most reli-&#xD;

Winthrop's principal help. on the arm had the&#xD;
fires in charge, and another man, ho was often&#xD;
employed as a day-laborer, was instructed to help&#xD;
look-after the horses at the door. And now every&#xD;
'thing was ready ; only Ernest was not there ; but&#xD;
they knew he would not come.. So Mrs. Winthrop,&#xD;
in he black silk dress and tasteful' cap, with her&#xD;
face both: sad and glad, went into the spare-room&#xD;
and sat down near the two windows. Deacon&#xD;
Winthrop was not 'far away. The  guests had all&#xD;
come, and their good pastor, Mr.  ilson,' stood&#xD;
waiting. There was a sudden husc, for Charles&#xD;

Allerton was doing his share in. con=&#xD;

ing to do so. She knew that he came to&#xD;

29?           FIFTY YEARS AGO.&#xD;
She thought of it after she got home that night,.&#xD;
and wondered'if he had forgotten whit he told her&#xD;
the afternoon before she went away. He. must&#xD;
have changed his mind now, for le had never&#xD;
alluded to it, or even to the letters. She had met&#xD;
him quite often during the winter, 1ut, save for a&#xD;
consciousness she always had that he knew she&#xD;
was present, and' from some quiet anticipation of&#xD;
her wishes, she felt that they were more strangers'&#xD;
than they had been during her absence.&#xD;
She never joined the girls in their laughing sur-&#xD;
mises about him. She seemed not to hear them.&#xD;
She knew that he was a general fa yorite, but the&#xD;
impression seemed to be that he was more devoted&#xD;
to his profession, and the interests of education,&#xD;
than to, any lady in particular. Well, why should&#xD;
she care? She certainly had no claims on his par-.&#xD;
ticular attention. She had fled from  is unexpected&#xD;
declaration, and refused to be mote than a very&#xD;
indifferent friend.  She wished s ,,e had never&#xD;
consented to correspond with him for then she&#xD;
should never have cared whethe he spoke to&#xD;
her or. not. Cared for him! .Wh  said she did&#xD;
care .for him, with his grand indiference?  She&#xD;
was sure she did not. If she could only have&#xD;
loved Mr. Lenox, she would hav   shown how&#xD;
little' she cared, for him! .But thai was all past,.&#xD;
and she had enough to fill up every moment&#xD;
of her life. She would try to be to her mother all&#xD;
that Annie had been, and forget the range reams&#xD;
which had disturbed her for the last. two years.&#xD;
She. could not go back to Boston, however much&#xD;
they might want her. Mother and the boys need-&#xD;
&#xD;
FIFTY YEARS AGO.           293&#xD;
ed her more -than any body else ; and, with an at-&#xD;
tempt at cheerful resignation, she at last fell&#xD;
asleep.&#xD;
The first few months after Annie's wedding&#xD;
seeme very strange at the old mansion. She had&#xD;
never een from home many days-at once; it seem-&#xD;
ed as i she must come back and fill her accustom-&#xD;
ed plage, but the household moved on. Aunt Lois&#xD;
said Grace was as "spry about the house as. she&#xD;
used to be climbing rocks."  Her mother often&#xD;
commended her for her helpful ways. The boys&#xD;
were rowing more helpful, too. Charles had be-&#xD;
come o accustomed to answer his mother's calls&#xD;
while  race was away, that he fitted in very nicely.&#xD;
He wa a great comfort to.his sister; he was so&#xD;
compa ionable, and her influence over him showed&#xD;
itself i" many little refining ways. Henry had a&#xD;
decided taste for study, and found in Doctor Al-&#xD;
lerton an encouraging and helpful friend. Mary&#xD;
was very fond of her sister. She missed Annie,&#xD;
and had never half forgiven Sandford Ross for tak-&#xD;
ing he away; but she comforted herself by saying&#xD;
uncle ould never take Grace to Boston any more.&#xD;
Ernest and Laura wrote occasionally, so that she&#xD;
was to erably well informed of what was going on&#xD;
in thei circle. She never read to her r other the&#xD;
portion s of Laura's letters 'whichspoke of her com-&#xD;
ing ba k to them with so much certainty ; it seem-&#xD;
'ed to her at present very impossible ; her duty&#xD;
evide tly was to stay at home ; she would be an&#xD;
excell nt daughter and sister all the days of her&#xD;
life ; a d thus thinking, she went out into the opeii.&#xD;
ing Spring. Annie's new'home was another source&#xD;

brotherly ways,. added to her list of real friends.&#xD;
She was quietly happy and' very busy, more&#xD;
thoughtful than .when we first met her three years&#xD;
before. She had had much occasio 'for thinking&#xD;
in these three years, and its results were written in&#xD;
the sweet expression of her beautiful face.&#xD;
"Grace has grown so womanly,' her mother&#xD;
would say to Annie. " I used to think she would&#xD;
never care-for anything serious,.like plain house-,&#xD;
hold ways. I expected when she went to Boston&#xD;
things there would be so much to her mind that she&#xD;
would never care to come home to live again. We&#xD;
can't always tell, but I should have expected she&#xD;
would 'have found in that Mr. Len x the very'&#xD;
things to please her. Sometimes I think now that,&#xD;
she is a little too sober for her, and yet I can't think&#xD;
anything really troubles her."&#xD;
"Oh, no !" said Annie, Et she is always very cheer-&#xD;
ful when'I see her. She misses Ernest, and I sip-.&#xD;
pose has not got quite accustomed o being' the&#xD;
eldest at home. I do not believe she egrets leav-&#xD;
ing Boston."&#xD;
" It's home where the heart is,' you know, moth-&#xD;
er, and I do not believe Grace's heart is in Boston."&#xD;
Mrs. Winthrop was so accustomed to counsel&#xD;
with her eldest daughter, that she still clung to&#xD;
her, and often sent for her to come and spend the&#xD;
day when she was more than usually oppressed.&#xD;
Thus the world moved on until June. The day&#xD;
had been lovely; every unfolded leaf and bud had&#xD;
waved a perfume in the quiet air. The birds had&#xD;
warbled volumes of sweet melodies, and now in&#xD;

4,Arthur and 'Mary had gone out to see ite&#xD;

very dignified of late. Doctor Allerton&#xD;
d his horse, and coming into the porch took&#xD;
ken chair and, commenting on the beauty of&#xD;
ening, fell quite  aturally into pleasant con-&#xD;
ion. Suddenly rising, as if a new-idea-had&#xD;
him, he said : "Come, Miss Grace! 1si't it&#xD;
le for you to get up a little enthusiasm over&#xD;
ew gig, and go with me in it over to thellake&#xD;

w Grace had made up her mind, from sundry&#xD;
s of late, that she was more than indifferent to&#xD;
Here was a fine opportunity; but his epeas-&#xD;
anner disarmed her, and then she was just a&#xD;
lonely, thinking of the many ha py hours she&#xD;
pent with Ernest in this old porch on just such&#xD;
ngs as -this. So she hesitated in the prompt&#xD;
ive she was prepared to give, and supplied&#xD;
ce by saying, "Mother is tired to-nghtfand&#xD;

"No,'' said Mrs. Winthrop; ".Grace can go if&#xD;
she chooses."&#xD;
"I really see no good reason for excusing you,"&#xD;
said he, turning to Grace and extending his hand&#xD;
as if to help her rise. "While you get your shawl&#xD;
and bonnet, I will show your mother what a com-&#xD;
fortable carriage we have."&#xD;
So I'm to- ride when his lordship condescends&#xD;
to ask me, thought Grace, as she gathered up her&#xD;
things by the moonlight which streamed into her&#xD;
window. "I wonder I care to go." She did not&#xD;
hurry'; she, came slowly. down-stairs and -lingered&#xD;
in the porch, not long, for Doctor Allerton came&#xD;
quickly, and with a protecting care quite unnecep-&#xD;
sary, considering th;e shortness and security of the&#xD;
way, led her to the carriage.&#xD;
"I wish I 'was going," said Mary. " Isn't there&#xD;
room for me, Doctor, if mother will let me go ?"&#xD;
"Some other time I will take you," said Doctor&#xD;
Allerton, and with a cheerful good-bye they rode&#xD;
away.&#xD;
Yoi and I, dear reader, have 'certain invisible&#xD;
privileges; if we chose we might go with Doctor&#xD;
Allerton on his moonlight ride; but we think they&#xD;
have a right to enjoy it entirely' to themselves;.&#xD;
only we cannot help knowing that the horse went&#xD;
very slowly on his way to the lake ; that the moon-&#xD;
beams fell on the rippling waters very beautifully,&#xD;
but all unheeded by the occupants of the new gig;&#xD;
and that the new gig itself might have been only&#xD;
ah ordinary wagon for any special notice it'g-ot after&#xD;
its first starting. But the ride -marked a new era&#xD;
in the lives of Hugh Allerton and Grace Winthrop.&#xD;

ith all the determined purpose of'his intense&#xD;
re, after his first six months' acquaintance,&#xD;
tor Allerton resolved to win 'Grace Winthrop&#xD;
his wife. Forced to a premature confession,&#xD;
er sudden going from: ome, he only obtained&#xD;
lightest possible hope n her consent to rely&#xD;

availed himself of her 'love for 'her'home and&#xD;
ds for subjects of real interest to her in wri&#xD;
Her replies convinced him that she was not&#xD;

,he had been obliged to rest until her return.&#xD;
expressed his gladness at her coming, uncertain&#xD;
t he had to expect from any new acquaintance&#xD;

ed Ernest, leading her on in pleasant conver--&#xD;
n, but never overstepping the bounds. of a&#xD;
ileged acquaintance. He made no' allusion;to&#xD;
letters that had passed between them, because&#xD;
ished her to feel that he would take no undue&#xD;
antage of her consent to correspond with him.&#xD;
ate he believed she was not indifferent to him.&#xD;
e in possession of this hope, he felt justified in&#xD;
ing to end his long probation. The result was&#xD;

Dotor Allertons love was the shadow it which&#xD;
she could rest- when her footsteps were weary.&#xD;
this:time .her heart responded to its call" s truly.&#xD;
as it phad grown. sill and heavy when Mr Lenox&#xD;
sought to win it.&#xD;
It' was late when the new gig brought th riders&#xD;
back to the gate under the elm tree. After seeing&#xD;
Grace. safely within the unfastened. door, Doctor&#xD;
Allerton, with a rejoicing heart, drove' on to his&#xD;
home. He drore slowly still, for he was glad to&#xD;
be out in the air, he wanted all the spac9 about&#xD;
him to expand his thoughts and take in his new&#xD;
position. He wanted - room to comprehend that&#xD;
the beautiful girl who seemed so beyond his reach&#xD;
had comeback to him more beautiful than ever;&#xD;
that she had listened to his story, and with all the,&#xD;
sweet trust peculiar to her nature, given him the,&#xD;
love he had so earnestly sought and so long waited&#xD;
for. He had half a mind to turn back an see if&#xD;
the house, which held this new treasure~ itually'&#xD;
stood quiet and still where he had left it half an&#xD;
hour. before. "Second thoughts" do come, how-.&#xD;
ever, onall occasions, and Doctor Allerton's took&#xD;
him home in perfect safety.&#xD;
Grace was glad everybody had gone to bed.&#xD;
She answered her mother's inquiries and did her&#xD;
'bdding about fastening the door, andthen went&#xD;
up to her room and sat down by the open xindow'&#xD;

good people of Beechford, by a series of gradual'&#xD;
convictions. Nobody wondered that Doctcr Aller-&#xD;
ton should fancy so lovely a girl as Grace Win-&#xD;
throp; and, after the usual adjusting of the affair&#xD;
i, the public mind'it came to be an accepte thing.&#xD;
Of course, this settled the question of her next year&#xD;
in Boston.&#xD;
During the sumner, she wrote to Lauraof her&#xD;
new' plans, leaving her to see that it would be im-&#xD;
possible for her to- go home with them n Sep-&#xD;
tember, and asking her to tell her father and&#xD;
mother so.&#xD;
Laura's congratulations were mingled wit many&#xD;
regrets. "I had so set my heart on having you&#xD;
here next winter," she wrote, " that I can hardly&#xD;
forgive Doctor Allerton for interfering w th my&#xD;
arrangements. I wanted you for my ride's-.&#xD;

How can I consent to your engagement ! Father&#xD;

Dodtor Allerton smiled very quietly over this&#xD;
tter, which Grace gave him to read. He remem-&#xD;
ered when her going had been to him the cause&#xD;
hidden pain, and her knowledge of the fact had&#xD;
nly made her the more glad to go. Now his ex-&#xD;

Ern st received the tidings with real pleasure.&#xD;

Charles wrote him a comical description of&#xD;
Weirr mother's consternation- when she found that&#xD;
[e must give up her second daughter.   "She&#xD;
kes Doctor Allerton too much to make any real&#xD;
xcusc," wrote he;. " apd father tels' her that she&#xD;
et her daughters the example, and what else can&#xD;
be expect. Now my fate is sealed. I shall have&#xD;
be all things in the household until Mary grows&#xD;
p. I had a mind to let Doctor Allerton know&#xD;
Liat I regarded him as interfering rather too much&#xD;
iith our matters when he got our Grace. Finally,&#xD;
gave it up. What's the use ? I could n't change&#xD;
ny thing; and, if she will marry, I don't kiow&#xD;
iho I should like half so well. When I 'get mad&#xD;
vern it, mother says we 'cannot expect to keep&#xD;
together always, and that it is a blessing to have&#xD;

" Well, Grace," said her grandfather, when, in&#xD;
process of time, he learned the fact of her engage-&#xD;
ment, "I am glad to hear this. I have always liked&#xD;
Doctor Allerton, and I have always thought he&#xD;
liked you. I'm glad you did not find any body out&#xD;
to Boston. I used to tell your grandmother that&#xD;
I was afraid you would have such a notion for&#xD;
riches that you would 'never want to come back&#xD;
to us again. I tell you what, child ! when any&#xD;
body is as near the end o life as I am, it is pretty&#xD;
plain what is worth living for. Doctor Allerton is&#xD;
an excellent young man, and I hope you will make&#xD;
as good a wife as your mother and grandmother r&#xD;
have done."&#xD;

Grace had found each day full of occupation.&#xD;
he had endeavored to lighten her mother's tasks,&#xD;

interrupted hours. in which she could ply her&#xD;
usy needle in her own service. She had ,found&#xD;
pleasure in ,Doctor i Allerton's companionship&#xD;
which gave promise of a happy future.    He&#xD;
rought her .as many books as she -had 'time to&#xD;
"ad; and some delightful . rides she took in that&#xD;

wood -box bore witness to Henry and Arthur s&#xD;
faithfulness.&#xD;
Julia Thorn and Edward Nelson were looking&#xD;
forward to a united home some day, so the girls&#xD;
had a new link of sympathy between them.&#xD;
Aunt Nannie's spring bleaching exceeded all her'&#xD;
former efforts. She and Aunt Lois were very&#xD;
much pleased with the' idea of Grace's marrying&#xD;
Doctor Allerton..- He. had grown to be quite an&#xD;
oracle with "hem, and they wanted her to have&#xD;
what they called a nice outfit.&#xD;
" Lois," said Aunt Nannie, one day, as she sat&#xD;
by her "chest of draw" carefully looking them&#xD;
over, "here's a pair of my fine linen sheets. I spun&#xD;
them before Grace was born. They are as handsome&#xD;
sheets a§ you'll see any where, and as white asi&#xD;
snow. I never used them a dozen titnes in my&#xD;
life, and 'taint likely I shall ever want them. I'm&#xD;
a good mind to give them to Grace-she'll set&#xD;
store gy them."&#xD;
"So she will," said Aunt Lois, "and you've&#xD;
plenty to last without them. I thought I'd look&#xD;
up a couple of pair of mi e ; we've got more than&#xD;
e shall use,_and I want to give her something to&#xD;
remember me by, dear Ghild." And Aunt Lois&#xD;
wiped away the tears which would come.&#xD;
Again' the old mansio$ gives tokens of some&#xD;
coming event.,&#xD;
It is a lovely morning in the latter part of June;.&#xD;
the doors and windows are -'all open; beautiful&#xD;
bunches of fragrant roses are on the shelves and on&#xD;
the .tables;'\and ini the fire-places in the "spare&#xD;

is hac brought buds and blossoms; all the wealth&#xD;
her fitle garden was her silent offering on this&#xD;
entful, day. Deacon Winthrop, in his Sunday&#xD;
st, sits in the oaken chair in the porch, and there,,&#xD;

anhoo4; he is chatting familiarly with his father&#xD;

or. Charles, Henry and Arthur- look impor-&#xD;

and t.ken his seat with them. Annie is up-stairs&#xD;

rdly necessary "to say that it is our Grace, and&#xD;
she puts the finishing rose-buds, all dewy and&#xD;
sh, in her beautiful hair, we need not wonder&#xD;
at Annie, who is seldom moved to enthusiasm,&#xD;
ters expressions of affectionate admiration over&#xD;

r it is the same rich white silk which shg has&#xD;
orn qrnly twice before on her coming out in Bos-&#xD;

r the occasion. The beautiful lace she had worn&#xD;

tonis ing what an outfit she had. Her toilette&#xD;

smoothed the folds of he dress as if she wou d ex-&#xD;
press to it her fondness for the wearer.&#xD;
There was a fluttering in and out of white&#xD;
dresses. Julia Thorn and Mary Ross had been&#xD;
there all the morning arranging flowers and as-&#xD;
sisting generally ; they'had been dressing, too, and&#xD;
were now joining Annie. and Mary in surveying&#xD;
the bride..&#xD;
Grandfather and grandmother had comelooking&#xD;
quietly happy. " I did n t expect to wait for this&#xD;
wedding," said the dear o! d gentleman. "I feel as&#xD;
young as I did when I ca e to see Sandford carry&#xD;
away Annie. I cannot  xpect to be here when&#xD;
little Mary goes; but the Lord knows best and I&#xD;
must bide my time."&#xD;
The .guests were now arriving fast, until in a&#xD;
short time every body had come. Ernest conc uct-&#xD;
e  Doctor Allerton to his fair bride. As he ook&#xD;
her hand and looked into her deep blue eyes, so'&#xD;
tender and womanly in their uplifting to his, hat&#xD;
wonder is it if his proud, thankful heart was ful1 of&#xD;
unspoken happiness! She was to be his cornan-&#xD;
iort until death should part them ; he had toiled to&#xD;
win, but this hour repaid it all. In a few moments&#xD;
they. were standing between the two windows in&#xD;
the spare room listening to Mr. Wilson. as he asked&#xD;
God's blessing on their coming vows. Then the&#xD;
words were spoken which made them one, andas&#xD;
Grace stood receiving the warm congratulations&#xD;
of those she loved, she; could scarce realize the oc-&#xD;
casion, or believe she was going out from home&#xD;
bearing another name and with a new protector-&#xD;

It 4as a very social, pleasant wedding. The&#xD;
ridegroom did not forget his. character as enter-&#xD;
aier, and was, as usual, self-possessed and thought-&#xD;
il for others. It was strange how stiffness melted&#xD;
way under his efforts to dispel it at any gathering,&#xD;
nd to-day he was too happy not to diffuse his spirit&#xD;
1 about him. Ch'rlie Thorn and Edward Nelson&#xD;
'ere there; they h d changed less than their early&#xD;
laymate, but they had never ceased to be friends&#xD;
Mrs. Winthrop- was far more cheerful than she&#xD;
ould have been without Ernest, and. Annie was&#xD;
t ho e, going about as .if she had never been&#xD;
way. The grand old elm seemed to spread itself&#xD;
new to keep out the rays of the summer's sun,&#xD;
nd the birds came into the branches and sang some&#xD;
f their choicest melodies. The delicious home-&#xD;
iade entertainment was abundant and :tempting.&#xD;
nnielhad been there several days; bringing all her&#xD;
xperimental knowledge-into service.&#xD;
Doctor Allerton had so many friends that at&#xD;
.rst he had -proposed. to have the wedding at the&#xD;
hurch ; but as this did.not meet Mrs..Winthrop's&#xD;
views . it was given up and the invitations confined&#xD;
o mutual friends. Doctor Allerton had arranged&#xD;
o take a vacation of two weeks, and in' that time&#xD;
isit his mother whom he had not seen for a year.&#xD;
About three o'clock his neat gig and strong, hand-&#xD;
ome horse was brought to the door. Grace had&#xD;
hanged her bridal dress for a traveling habit and&#xD;
was standing with her fiends grouped about her.&#xD;
Charles and Henry brought down the same little&#xD;
runk that had accompanied -her on her former&#xD;
ourneys.&#xD;

How is this, Doctor ?" said Ernet "this y&#xD;
lady and that trunk belofig to my spirit of a&#xD;
ture. Suppose we leave yrou to look after thi&#xD;
folks while we set out to peek our fortunes ag&#xD;
"'I will leave you with the cares this time,'&#xD;
the happy Doctor. "I will see that the young&#xD;
and the trurik are well looked after."&#xD;
Grace's good-byes would have been prolo&#xD;
for an indefinite time, had not Doctor Allerto&#xD;
her to the carriage, telling her playfully that it&#xD;
vacation now, and they must improve every&#xD;
ment of it. Shelingered long enough to pu&#xD;
arm round Ernest's neck nd whisper, "Good&#xD;
my darling brother. Love me always." And&#xD;
she was gone,&#xD;
Then came the reaction which follows the&#xD;
parture of the bride. Thy guests kept going&#xD;
only the family were left. And as the twi&#xD;
shades came on, the flowers drooped and thec&#xD;
cares came over the hoqsehqld. Ernest felt&#xD;
and desolate. This was his first visit .homc&#xD;
came a week before the wedding and had enj&#xD;
his old, boyish freedom exceedingly. . He had&#xD;
some delightful talks with Gracey Until she&#xD;
really gone, he had not realized that she was n,&#xD;
going to live there :any more, or how lone&#xD;
would be without her. jhe thought made&#xD;
restless, and he wandered out over the hill&#xD;

mother," said he, as he.joined them, "that it was&#xD;
just'such an evening as this, four years-ago, that&#xD;
Grace and I sat here planning that wonderful&#xD;
journey to Boston.? How wild you thought we&#xD;
were !'&#xD;
" Iwas a wild thing, Ernest, for you two young&#xD;
peopl to go off on such :a journey, btit it-has all&#xD;
come out right ; only I wish you were nearer&#xD;
home. Do you really think it w s the best thing&#xD;
you could do to go away from Be chford ?"&#xD;
" Yes, mother, the very best.  course I lose a&#xD;
great deal of pleasure in not coming to this dear&#xD;
old spot every day of my life, but I can be a more&#xD;
useful man where I am. I must go abroad carry-&#xD;

"I'i going to be a doctor,'' said Henry.; "my&#xD;
mind is made up for that. Doctor Allerton says&#xD;
he wil help me; he thinks it is the best thing I&#xD;
can d.&#xD;
"It looks like something a good way off, your&#xD;
being a doctor," said his mother; " but 'I used to&#xD;
think it would be a great while before Annie, Er..&#xD;
nest and Grace would leave me, and before I knew&#xD;
it the time has comb."&#xD;
" Rather a lonely time,.too, isn't it, mother ?"&#xD;
said' Charles. ''I don't know how I'm going to&#xD;
stand .it without Giace. I thought this morning&#xD;
when I saw what a tine looking man Doctor AIler-&#xD;
ton was, and how like a gentleman all his Gays&#xD;
were, was quite willing he should have our Grace&#xD;

Charles looked so indignantly grieved, tha&#xD;
mother said soothingly, "'It will -come mor&#xD;
again some time, Charles, and then you will foi&#xD;
the robber; things look to us so differentl'&#xD;
daylight."&#xD;
"I, don't ink this will. I wish you had al&#xD;
for me in ycur business, Ernest, I believe I w&#xD;
go back wit you."&#xD;
"Oh no, you would not!" said Ernest. "F&#xD;
and mother depend very much on you.&#xD;
boy, you are.. going to see Grace in less than&#xD;
weeks. When do you think I shall see her&#xD;
and I g-ewv up together, sharing each other's&#xD;
and sorrows. She helped me over many a diff&#xD;
spot. I do not know what I should have&#xD;
without her my first six months in Boston ;&#xD;
now-months and years may go by and I shall n&#xD;
see her. ':If it 'had not been for Doctor Allerto&#xD;

'To-night, I say, children had better stay at h&#xD;

profoundness.S&#xD;
'I hope you will remember- that a good wh&#xD;

"She promised she would stay. on    half. an&#xD;

time seems to have no meaning."&#xD;
"I understand that pretty well," said Deacon&#xD;

Sandford."&#xD;
The conversation  ent to Grace and the wed-&#xD;
ding. - Charles gradually got "in tune," and felt&#xD;
soniewhat better before his sister left. Ernest had&#xD;
three or four days yet to" stay. He visited all of&#xD;
his old friends, climbed Eagle Mountain, and re.&#xD;
called the time when he used to think it one of the&#xD;
boundaries of the.world- He had some quiet talks&#xD;
with his mother, which strengthened and refreshed&#xD;
him. He listened t his grandfather and grand-&#xD;
mother's words of wisdom and thought. If he&#xD;
could ever stand at the river's brink waiting so&#xD;
peacefully, and trusting to be carried overt"h&amp;amp;&#xD;
should be blest, indeed. And then he went back&#xD;
to his life-work with a new benediction 'overhin&#xD;

high enough to convince him that his father'&#xD;

" What noisy little fellows !" said the tired,&#xD;
father, returning the baby to its other's&#xD;
and throwing himself into the big, easy chair,&#xD;

upon his father's boot, and was rewarded by&#xD;

of the paternal foot.&#xD;
Doctor Allerton had seen much rofession&#xD;
in these five years, but, with fir  health&#xD;
steadfast purpose, he had gone rig t on, a&#xD;
'tering to the sick and- suffering with a -ch&#xD;

great 'rest in good old Aunt Lois. Aunt1&#xD;
died about a year after Grace's marriage, an&#xD;
ly, sad Auit Lois turned to Grace, as her g&#xD;
earthly comfort. At first she would go a&#xD;
w1ith her days, always going. hom' at nigh&#xD;

made" alley-beds'in the new garden, apd ;looked&#xD;
after things" just as she used to at Mi-s. Winthrop'.&#xD;
She was very fond of the children, and greatly&#xD;
lieved their mother -in the care-of them. But we&#xD;
have wandered fi'om the parlor..window and the&#xD;
scene it opened. Mrs. Allerton transferred her&#xD;
laughing baby, to its father's arms, and wen't out 'to&#xD;
see that tea was soon ready, for she well knew that&#xD;
howev fond hir husband might- be of her's and&#xD;
the children's welcome, his long rides gav$ him a&#xD;
keen appetite, and included a quickly-coming tea&#xD;
in the welcome. Coming back shortly, she leaned&#xD;
over his chair to watch the frolic of her. boys.&#xD;
"Come, come, little fellows," said the doctor,&#xD;
"this will never do. I am too tired and hungyto be&#xD;
a good subject for such young kings long atonce.&#xD;
Tossing Winthrop into the air, he landed him'i&#xD;
his mother's arms; then opened the doorforEr'&#xD;
nest, who quickly found his way out to where Aunt&#xD;
Lois was still tying up rose-bushes.&#xD;
That night Mrs.' Allertonhushed her aby to&#xD;
sleep, as usual, and laid him softly down for;a quiet&#xD;
rest. Towards morning, she was awakened by his&#xD;
heavy breathing and great apparent    stress&#xD;
Quickly rousing  er husband, 'she fo1loii ed 'his'&#xD;

relieved, and fell asleep in her arms,:but shf coud&#xD;
not sleep -again; so she watched 'him until the&#xD;
morning broke. For a time he rallied and eemd&#xD;

turned to her husband, believing that&#xD;

few dewy rosebuds were drooping on his snowy&#xD;
pillow, and scattered in the folds of his dre s. Very&#xD;
quickly the day came when this beautify 1 image&#xD;
must be hidden from her sight-hidden until the&#xD;
trump of the archangel should bid it cone forth&#xD;
free from the bondage of sin. Taking Ernest's&#xD;
hand in hers, the.smitten mother went o nce more&#xD;
to look upon her baby's face. The w ndering&#xD;
child had sought in vain to solve the strange mys-&#xD;
tery of the household, the baby's long, quiet sleep,&#xD;
his mother's sad, tearful face, and his father's grave&#xD;
manner !-he could not comprehend it. Doctor&#xD;
Allerton paused when he came to find his wife,&#xD;
where he knew she had gone. In the same parlor&#xD;
where, so few days ago, we saav him enter-and sur-&#xD;
prise the laughing group, he found her sitting with&#xD;
Ernest on her lap, while her bowed head and fast-&#xD;
coming'sobs told of the grief within. The boy's&#xD;
childish words were awed into a whisper and he&#xD;
went into his father's arms with a subdued glad-&#xD;
ness, greatly in contrast to his usu al mann r.&#xD;
"God has taken his own, mydarling." said Doc-&#xD;
tor Allerton, Ttenderly drawing his wife towards&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"I know it now, my husband," was her quiet&#xD;
reply, and, with one fervent:kiss on her baby's&#xD;
brow, she went away and left im. Many sympa-&#xD;
thizing friends came and listened with her to the&#xD;
tender prayer offered by her kind, fatherly pastor,&#xD;
and to the precious, wonderful words . e read&#xD;
from God's own exhaustless book. When the&#xD;
short, simple services were closed, she flowed&#xD;
the little one to its resting place on the hill-side,&#xD;

The years rolled on, and, other children were&#xD;
given to her keeping. Her husband's professionaI&#xD;
duties led him much abroad, out into the toil 'and'&#xD;
weariness of life, but she kept the altar-fire of his&#xD;
home burning brightly, :and reared his children&#xD;
in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. It&#xD;
was a strong, distinctive element of her educa-&#xD;
tional training, that her .children were cre ted to&#xD;
do God's will, not "as of necessity," but as glad,&#xD;
willing servants, esteeming it. greater honor than&#xD;
any earthly thing. With ever buoyant. spirts, and&#xD;
tender sympathies, she combined the discreet,&#xD;
guiding mother with the loved companion and&#xD;
friend. Nor were her efforts confined to ler own&#xD;
household. It was said of her,' "Such a woman as&#xD;
Mrs. Allerton is one of Heaven's blessings to the&#xD;
community in which she dwells." She found un-&#xD;
told strength in the firm, reliant power of her hus-&#xD;
band. Even on earth she learned whiy she was&#xD;

Allerton was prompt to do the bidding. Arrived&#xD;
at Mr. Welford's elegant mansion, he was shown&#xD;
into the library, where that .gentleman was sitting,&#xD;
conversing with a middle-aged gentleman   who&#xD;
seemed to be an invalid. Ernest hesitated, 2on:see;&#xD;

".I understand it," said he, "and so does this&#xD;
gentleman. He is a friend of Mr. Marshall and&#xD;
myself, and I have just been telling him the whole&#xD;
story of the case."&#xD;
The message was delivered in such a manner&#xD;
that it was plain the bearer understood why he&#xD;
came. "I shall have to detain you a few moments,'&#xD;
said Mr. Welford, "though. I think I know exactly&#xD;
where to find the papers.". He left the room; with-&#xD;
out thinking to introduce the young rhan to the&#xD;
elder one. So they sat awhile in silence, Ernest&#xD;
turning over the leaves of a book which he took&#xD;
up from the table. The elder gentleman rose and&#xD;
walked slowly back and forth, keeping his eyes,&#xD;
Ernest. thought, very keenly fixed on him. At&#xD;
length he stopped directly in front of him. ".Par-&#xD;

what your mother's name was, before her marf&#xD;

'"The story is written with a great deal'of grace and refinement, and&#xD;
is intended to be a 'Society' novel, holding up the selfishness and world.&#xD;
liness of the merely fashionable, in contrast with Christian simplicity and&#xD;
self-denial.."-Christian Witness.&#xD;
"A well-written story, and the evident aim of the author is to do good&#xD;
to every reader. It is a very interesting narrative, and the pleasures&#xD;
and misfortunes and unlucky days of the young lady .who figures prin-&#xD;
cipally, are described in a manner true to life. It does one good to read&#xD;
such a book, it serves to impress one in a solemn yet pleasant manner&#xD;
of the great aim and end of life, and in ulcates those excellent moral pre-&#xD;
cepts which all would do well to imitate."-Transcript.,&#xD;
