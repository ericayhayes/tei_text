            <head>WORKS OF SIR EDWARD LYTTON BULWER</head>
            <head type="sub">(LORD LYTTON.)</head>
            <p>It is almost superfluous to say a word in praise of the prince of novelists. He holds
               an undivided sceptre over the mind of every intelligent reader. For skillful plots,
               fine discrimination of character, and powerful delineation of passion, he has no
               equal. Time flies, and in his course sweeps down the budding as well as the matured
               fruits of other authors—but his keen scythe leaves the productions of Bulwer as fresh
               and lovely as when he first gladdened the eyes of his readers with their manifold
               excellences. PRICE FIFTEEN CENTS EACH.</p>
            <list>
               <item>RIENZI. This glorious Republican treads amid the broken pillars of the antique
                  forum, and rouses his fallen countrymen. In this great book Bulwer admirably
                  blends the old heroic souls of the ancient Roman with the picturesque, and perhaps
                  more loveable, personages of early Italy.</item>
               <item>PELHAM; or, The Adventures of a Gentleman. Bulwer gives us an insight into the
                  fashionable phase of London Society, and makes us acquainted with the real "higher
                  classes."</item>
               <item>PAUL CLIFFORD. It takes nothing from the interest of this great story to know
                  that many of its incidents are true to life. It shows that vice in its most
                  captivating form but leads to destruction.</item>
               <item>EUGENE ARAM. Stripped of all embellishment, this is the most woful tale that
                  ever was truly told; but, told as Bulwer has narrated it, it would bring tears
                  from any eyes, "how'ver unused to the melting mood."</item>
               <item>THE DISOWNED. No story was ever more full of striking incidents, or of more
                  deeply cut characters. Truly a great novel: a novel, indeed, that has no superior
                  among books of its class.</item>
               <item>FALKLAND. Full of the tenderness of Petrarch and the ardor of Abelard. Unlike
                  any other work by him, it is still full of genius. It is out of the fulness of the
                  heart that the mouth pours forth its eloquence. In same volume:</item>
               <item>PILGRIMS OF THE RHINE. Every reviewer has eulogized this charming volume. Those
                  who intend travelling on the blue stream that mirrors <title>Bingen</title> on its
                  bosom should read this book.</item>
               <item>LAST DAYS OF POMPEH. It required the highest genius to fitly describe the
                  terrible overwhelming of this city. The blind girl, Nidia, has furnished themes
                  for playwrights, painters and sculptors.</item>
               <item>THE STUDENT. The thoughtful devotee of science is most poetically depicted. The
                  interesting scholar, with his face "sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,"
                  is a noble character.</item>
               <item>DEVEREUX. Even Bulwer cannot hope to surpass this story. It seems perfection in
                  overy particular. We can recall the name of no modern book that has taken such a
                  firm hold on popularity.</item>

            <head>SYNOPSIS.</head>
            <p>MANY are still living of those who can yet recall the feats of the man whose name
               gives title to this book. Joaquin Murietta was the son of worthy parents, and nothing
               in his early youth betokened any traits of the monster which he afterwards became. He
               left Sonora, the lovely country of his birth, and visited the province of Mexico,
               where he became attached to the household of the then famous Santa Anna. Quarrelling
               with one of the attaches, he openly insulted him; but the man he insulted did not
               resent it, and Joaquin scornfully rode away, to soon after re-appear in his native
               town. Here he married a young Sonorian, Carmela Felix. A year of tranquil happiness
               had barely passed before he was summoned by his brother to visit him at the Mission
               of San Jose, in California. He went, accompanied by his wife. Carlos, the brother,
               was rejoiced to have Joaquin with him. Together they proceeded upon some business to
               the mines. Here a friend of theirs, Flores, was found in possession of a mule alleged
               to have been stolen. Carlos was with Flores at the time of his arrest; and the first
               thing that Joaquin knew of the arrest of his brother was seeing the two friends
               hanging from a tree—dead! From that moment Joaquin's nature and disposition underwent
               a fearful change. Still, however, at the entreaties of his wife, Joaquin resumed work
               as a miner. On one occasion a set of ruffians tried to drive him from the claim on
               which he was at work. Joaquin resisted. Pistols flashed, Joaquin fell, wounded and
               senseless. When he awoke to reason, it was to find Carmela, worse than dead, beside
               him. From this moment the fires of perdition appeared to blaze in his heart. From
               crime to crime he passed on with furious rage, until there was hardly a town in
               California that couldn't show the victims of his fatal bullet or the smouldering
               ruins caused by his torch. In the following pages every trace of his blood-stained
               footsteps is closely followed. Some of the facts are furnished by cotemporary
               witnesses; most of them by official documents. He proceeded from step to step, wading
               deeper and deeper into crime, until quiet citizens were almost afraid to breathe his
               name aloud. Nor was he alone in his nefarious exploits. His infamous notoriety
               surrounded him with a band of satellites only inferior to himself in his bad
               eminence. Resolute men went—sometimes in parties, sometimes singly—to waylay and
               capture him. Very few, however, returned to say anything of his whereabouts. In some
               solitary gulley the daring men would be found, with some token on other left to
               signify that they had met their death at the hands of Joaquin or some of his
               heartless lieutenants. So great at length became the terror inspired by his ruthless
               deeds, and fright so magnified them that hundreds swore that there was not one
               Joaquin—but a dozen at the least. Sheriffs of counties hunted him with picked men.
               The Governor of the State offered vast rewards for his capture, dead or alive.
               Eventually he fell into the hands of a brave American, Captain Love, who secured him
               in the jail at Martinez, from which he was taken by force, and hung by a number of
               Mexicans. He was decapitated, and his head publicly exhibited in San Francisco.</p>
            <p>In addition to this being a faithful narration of the fearful deeds of Joaquin,
               incidentally the work gives a faithful delineation of "life in the diggings" in the
               early days of California, when almost every nugget of gold was blood-spotted ere rude
               Justice bared her death-dealing arm.</p>

               <p>THE sons are growing or grown up of the men who went it with a rush through the
                  Golden Gates, by the different ways over the Camanche infested plains, by the
                  sickly Chagres and the Isthmus innocent of railroad cars, for the treacherous
                  mongrels to scowl at in '50 '51 and '52. There are many of the brave hearts, stout
                  frames—spite of fever of camp and field—keen eyes, hands ready for friend and
                  against foe, generous pockets, and welcoming laugh left—thanks to heaven of the
                  Returned Californians. They are the ones who will not have to be more than this
                  once reminded who JOAQUIN MURIETE was, that Red-handed Ravager, that King of
                  Cut-throats, that Murderer of the Mines, that Pirate of the Placers, that
                  deepest-cursed of greasers in gully and canon. From Maximilian's northernmost
                  lines to the British Territories, from the Rocky Mountains to the beautiful
                  Pacific, the blood-scored adventures, live yet, the celebrity is still well known
                  for robbery and killing.</p>
               <p>England does pretty well with her Jonathan Wilds, Captain Bloods,
                     <unclear>crude</unclear> highwaymen, and captains of other crews. Italy is all
                  very well with her Mazzaronis, Rinaldo Rinaldinis, and Fras Diavolo (whom the
                  opera makes fall into a trap that a gosling depredator would have smelt out, a
                  cub-fox avoid and a chicken have fought its way out of.) And France may ring out
                  its "la belle" to good (or bad) purposes with Cartouches, Mandrins, Scorchers and
                  Flayers, just as Germany can gutterally chant the doing so Robbers of the Rhine,
                  who plundered to banquet on swine's flesh, beer, Bolognas, Limburger with or
                  without speck, Schweitzer kaese and all, no less merilly than more fastidious
                  bandits on wines and Capuan dainties.</p>
               <p>But—very high, ruddy and glittering pile—it takes the land of Gold to "rake it."
                  Joaquin is the implement in the croupier's hand.</p>
               <p>To begin, no one, is to think El Dorado what it was from '48 to '52; not at all.
                  The spirit never winced when Sacramento and Saint —— (any name in the calender)
                  were flooded and washed to nothing, when "Charley the Chief" couldn't save
                  "Frisco" from the flames, has converted the chaotic Eden into a proper paradise,
                  where everything man can desire grows to more than perfection—from lovely and
                  grand-hearted maid to luscious fruits. In the days of the fresh-comes, when many
                  had broken bad English and worse French in chat with Capt. Sutter, had broken
                  savings, (and hearts (?) may be) over the Bella Union tables, had broken the peace
                  of dark senoritas who dropped coward native lovers for the fine, large Americans
                  who stood twenty lassomen, with one six-shooter or a twelve-inch Bowie hilt and
                  blade.</p>
               <p>In those passed times, not pastimes by a long shot, the man was liberal who call
                  the Shining Shore a civilized country, and he would not be believed either.</p>
               <pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC8324-00000004"/>
               <p>There were ugly crowds flocking there, and jail-birds, and those who ought to have
                  been encaged, were plenty as wild prairie fowls in a Chicago market.</p>
               <p>Too many Italians, who gave themselves out as broken-down water-fountain-stand
                  keepers at Naples, Florentine money-changers reduced to the ranks of the Lazarous
                  by robberies on them, or Venetian gondoliers, were more than suspected of being
                  beggars who had flourished daggers and flirted out pistols as spurs to
                  charity.</p>
               <p>Frenchmen there were who were reported to have revolutionized a little, without
                  other authority than their own, principally devoting themselves to securing "funds
                  for the cause,"—a cause which Jeanneton and Lamourdemarie, girls of caberets, were
                  concerned in.</p>
               <p>The Spaniards and such were merely ear-ringed sailors who had collided with first
                  mates and had to hide from justice, till the first vessel sailed with them in the
                  hold as stow-aways, in such seaports as kept gibbets standing; or were fellows
                  indisposed to clean Havana's and Mexico's streets in a chain-gang as they feared
                  would come to pass. The English when "chummed" together, might be overheard
                  remembering in slang certain pocket-diving and crib-cracking feats, along with
                  "lushing" in and about St. Luke's Whitechapel, Elephant and Castle, Golden Lane,
                  King's Cross, and so on. The States' men hailed from the chief cities and did not
                  recognize one another, but preferred strangers to mate off with instead of the
                  acquaintances who accosted them so rudely and significantly on the wharf or plank
                  walk: 'Hullo, ol' Mississip', whar am de cards dat allers turn Jack?'——'Your term
                  out, Ned? or did you jump Sing Sing?'——'The deuce who'd a-<emph>think</emph>
                  Charlestown would a-give you up so quick!' 'Gaul darn ye, if 'taint Baltimore who
                  forgot his name warn't Rob Smith an' went an' signed it to a promisory note! Well,
                  I'm te-totally darned.' And Sidney skylarks floated over the Balboan waters,
                  somehow or other.</p>
               <p>And yet a number of these men, to counter-balance a number of the always accounted
                  good, dropped what seemed a mast (though worn for years) and went to work with
                  spiked pole, spade, pick, barrow, bowl, sieve and cradle as honest, industrious
                  and steady as the best. Their reverse counterparts, losing their outfits and their
                  money to live on in the saloons though they were clergymen's sons, rich, of high
                  station and all that, went down the stream after a Niagara <emph>fall.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>To this land of such strangely mingled people, came Joaquin Murieta at the opening
                  of 1848.</p>
               <p>He was born in Sonora's capital, in Mexico, of a family respectable enough, and
                  sufficiently well of to give him a good education as education went in the priest
                  ridden country.</p>
               <p>He was noticeable during his youth for the gentlest and most placid of natures;
                  everybody who knew him in those days speaking rapturously of his then noble and
                  generous spirit.</p>
               <p>In '45, being sixteen years of age, Joaquin left his native place to seek his
                  fortune in the capital of all the provinces, Mexico.</p>
               <p>As he was of good figure and not unpleasing bearing, he soon obtained the
                  situation of squire in the wealthy household of President Lopez de Santa Anna.</p>
               <p>Mean as was this post, the young blade was told that it might be merely the first
                  round of a ladder reaching to eminence, for he was ambitious and a little
                  chafed.</p>
               <p>Santa Anna had always been a lover of horsemanship, a piece of information
                  received gladly by Joaquin, who was somewhat noted in his parts as a vaquero for
                  he had tamed wild horses time and again, not to say, accomplished wonderfully the
                  lesser feats of tossing bulls on their backs, lassoing, picking up hand kerchiefs
                  from the dust at full gallop.</p>
               <p>He saw in the governor's passion a means of pointing out himself and doubt less of
                  being promoted.</p>
               <p>His elevated hopes did not come to effect as easily as he had anticipated. He had
                  to lower his pretentions a little, besides, on account of the way in which his
                  fellow riders discountenanced his attempts to shine above them.</p>
               <p>One of these other horsemen was a Mexican named Camplido, who had often growled
                  about the somewhat aristocratic airs which Joaquin had taken.</p>
               <p>The latter saw the enmity growing, but pretented at first not to notice the sneers
                  and scornful looks with which he was liberally favored: he minded his own business
                  instead of letting himself be troubled with other affairs, an act of good sense
                  that seems unrivalled in a Mexican.</p>
               <p>So unrivalled that Camplido did not imitate him. He made his padre pray for an
                  opportunity to come to him.</p>
               <p>It came very soon. Joaquin was jumping up on his horse one day, not in a stately,
                  regular mode according to rule, but after a savage style which he had caught from
                  some Texan borderers. He lit fair and true in the saddle, but, in half turning to
                  make sure that the crupper had not been displaced by his fall, lightly as it had
                  been made, saw a grin on Camplido's face and half heard him saying something to a
                  couple of fellows beside him.</p>
               <p>"Did you speak to me?" cried Joaquin, turning pale and then red under his browned
                  skin.</p>
               <p>"Why, yes," replied Camplido, who, being a full grown man, was not going to let
                  the little bantam hear him deny his crow. "And, if you want to know, Mister
                  Sonorian, what I said, it only was: "Carajo, what a clumsy way to bestride a
                  nag."</p>
               <p>"Clumsy!" echoed the other, holding in his mount, "it's an American way, which
                  none of you inland cowards dare try with a wild mustang as <emph>I</emph>
                  can."</p>
               <p>And he proudly smiled at remembrance of the days when the herds of wild horses had
                  been corraled and tamed by himself and his friends, boy though he was.</p>
               <p>"That's it! speak well for the heathen Americans, the grasping, cowardly, lying
                  race!" cried Camplido with all a Mexican's contempt for the people who had taken
                  Texas and were afterwards to take more from the "sick man" of America.</p>
               <p>"Heathens, no doubt," retorted Joaquin hotly. "Grasping, eh? yes, if you mean the
                  Americans are men to grasp a friend's hand heartily and a foe's throat like a
                  vice. Cowardly! oh, yes! Cowards generally do go trapping and hunting in the
                  Indian territory, they do tackle 'Rapahoes seven to one, they do chase Comanches,
                  they ten, the redskins a hundred and fifty and all braves; they do rescue poor
                  girls stolen from the missions, out of Apache villages; thats the way of cowards,
                  is it? They lie, do they, of course? They said they would settle Texas, and they
                  didn't, eh? they said they would have there a republic, and they hoisted no lone
                  star on the tall cedar-poles left standing in their clearings, oh, no! Seems to me
                  their piece of Mexico counts one in the Union's twenty and odd states! Any how,"
                  concluded the Sonorian, with flushed cheeks and working hands, "I have not learnt
                  bad horsemanship from such fearless riders, though they're not up to your mark,
                  Senor Camplido. Suppose you see if <emph>I</emph> am."</p>
               <p>"I'm willing," said the Mexican furious, "and I don't mind seeing if your little
                  tender paws can handle a cuchillo of a man better than they do a bridle of a
                  horse."</p>
               <p>But the others prevented the contest being for the present any other than one of
                  cavaliers.</p>
               <p>"We must see the trial first," muttered one of the witnesses. "Caspita! they can
                  cut throats afterwards."</p>
               <p>On the appointed day, the whole household of the President got together, with the
                  secret hope of having a laugh over the foregone discomfiture of the young
                  Sonorian.</p>
               <pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC8324-00000005"/>
               <p>The two contestants opened performances with a couple of short runs, various
                  tricks, rearings, prancings and all the artificial steps of the 'manege.' This was
                  only to warm the blood of both horses and masters.</p>
               <p>Leaping over an adobe wall, six feet high and three thick, with a hundred feet for
                  start, without a graze of a horse's hoof to tell the story, was the finale.
                  Camplido was first, and over he went to the cheers of his friends.</p>
               <p>Joaquin was smiling to himself, for he was thinking of how he had often taken
                  greater jumps over huge fallen trees, wide splits in the ground from earthquakes,
                  broken and dethroned boulders, clumps of cactus and thick hedges of the
                  chapparal.</p>
               <p>He walked his horse on for fifty feet, and only began to gallop within half the
                  prescribed distance.</p>
               <p>As he neared the wall, ere he was within a yard of the holes in the earth made by
                  the other jumper, he buried both his spurs in his steed's belly and up it went in
                  the air. At the moment, a white sun-scarf, tied to the end of an escopette's
                  ramrod, was floated in the up-rising and on-coming leaper's face.</p>
               <p>The beast started, swerved, and, unable to prevent its spring, took the wall
                  sideways and, as a natural result, kicked a couple of the rude bricks before its
                  feet.</p>
               <p>It all but fell, but the master had already slung one leg over its lowered head
                  and dropped to the ground.</p>
               <p>Everybody was laughing, as he turned round indignantly, and Camplido's throat was
                  not the one that made the least noise.</p>
               <p>Suddenly he lifted the be-scarfed rod which he still held, to parry a knife thrust
                  which was dealt at him. It was Canales, one of the grooms.</p>
               <p>He had had the same trick served on him at his own first entering the service and,
                  though strongly suspecting the author, had never found it out beyond doubt.</p>
               <p>Now it was he who sprang upon laughing Camplido.</p>
               <p>But Joaquin, leaving his quivering horse with a "So-hoa!" to him, rushed forward
                  in time to knock up a down-stroke which would beyond doubt have made the traitor
                  pay with his life for his act of baseness.</p>
               <p>Joaquin declared that he alone would spill blood in his own defence, if than must
                  be, but, as it was, he did not care to have one drop of such a miserable
                  life-current let out of so worthless a man.</p>
               <p>He mounted his horse slowly, to give Camplido a chance to show what little courage
                  he might have, but there was no movement on the latter's part.</p>
               <p>Then, smiling scornfully, he leaped his horse quietly over the wall, clean this
                  time, and rode out of the court-yard gate, never to enter it again.</p>
               <p>When returned to his <emph>own</emph> country, he was determined to cast aside all
                  his ambitious desires and live happily and placidly in the charming hot sunshine
                  of Sonora.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, in the month of January, 1848, Joaquin did leave the province and
                  went to San Francisco, in quest of a brother of his named Carlos, who—since
                  sometime residing in Upper California—had obtained from one of the district
                  governors, a piece of land of four square leagues.</p>
               <p>Joaquin in vain made inquiries; he could not even gain any intelligence of him,
                  and had to return home. To make up for that supposed loss, he had not long been
                  back than he married a young Sonorian girl, Carmela Felix.</p>
               <p>At the end of a year's wedded life, he received a letter from his brother, in
                  which he was begged to hurry to the Mission of San Jose.</p>
               <p>Carlos added that great quantities of gold had been discovered in the mountains
                  and that if Joaquin wanted to make a fortune, all he had to do was to lose no time
                  in reaching the placers.</p>
               <p>Joaquin instantly got ready for the journey, but the illness of his father and
                  other family matters delayed his setting out by some ten months.</p>
               <p>Then he started, accompanied by his wife.</p>
               <p>When he arrived at San Francisco, Joaquin was so immensely astounded at the change
                  that had taken place since his former visit, that he made up his mind to spend
                  several days there to see how the new comers would open their new life.</p>
               <p>So he sauntered around among the shanties and tents and one or two patent
                  take-to-pieces-and-put-together-again houses, that were run up like card-board
                  palaces, watching the ships being unloaded slowly, for they were dreadfully
                  short-handed and the most monstrous wages for 'longshoremen were laughed at by the
                  out-at-elbow-and-knee loungers even.</p>
               <p>On the second day, in one of the gambling-saloons, already busy in fleecing the
                  floor idlers, who had made their pile even that early, and thought to risk a few
                  cunces while waiting for a homeward bound craft, Joaquin met his brother.</p>
               <p>The latter had the bad news to tell him that, by some flaw in his title, some of
                  the adventurers had taken away from him the four leagues of granted land.</p>
               <p>He was going to the mines to hunt up a witness of whom he had need, after which
                  they two would go to Mexico in order to see the giver of the concession and
                  recover the property, if that was possible at that stage of disorder. Joaquin
                  expressed a great desire to go to the mines to see about the gold.</p>
               <p>Carlos was only too glad to have him along with him, but——as he knew something of
                  the roughness of the camp-life where all were men——he counseled Joaquin to leave
                  his wife at the Dolores Mission under guard of an old friend there Manuel
                  Sepulveda.</p>
               <p>The very next day, the two brothers went up to Sacramento, where they bought
                  horses to go to Hangtown.</p>
               <p>They found the witness that Carlos was after, there.</p>
               <p>He was a young native Californian called Flores.</p>
               <p>He was fresh from a miners' camp some distance off, which he had left to come down
                  to sell gold dust.</p>
               <p>After supper at a Mexican eating-house, Flores borrowed Joaquin's mule and went
                  out for a stroll with Carlos.</p>
               <p>Joaquin, a little out of sorts from the journeying over roads so bad and the
                  change of water (for liquor was so valuable that the creeks supplied two-thirds of
                  the contents of bottles of mezcal and aguardiente), stayed in the house smoking
                  cigarettes, contemplating the grand invasion of Americans into this lately rich
                  domain of Mexico.</p>
               <p>He had become acquainted with many of the Northerners during the late war and,
                  full of disgust at so often having seen the imbecility of his fellow countrymen,
                  had preserved a most favorable impression of the American character, often
                  regretting that he had not been born under the stars and stripes.</p>
               <p>He contrasted his lazy, cowardly, treacherous, lying countrymen with the men of
                  the Republic, so energetic, active, brave, and so filled with love of liberty.</p>
               <p>If it had not been for his little happy, peaceful home so picturesquely embosomed
                  in one of the most charming vales of Sonora, which he little dreamed would ever
                  become part of the Republic, he would have for ever flung aside his nationality to
                  become in fact what he was in heart, an American Citizen.</p>
               <p>All of a sudden, Joaquin's reflections were broken into by wild yells from some
                  hundreds of people who were thronging the streets, if you have a mind to call them
                  that, and giving tongue in cries of:</p>
               <p>"String 'em up! hang 'em, hang 'em! Rope 'em quick, Pete! No Judge Lynch for the
                  greasers caught in the act!"</p>
               <p>Joaquin sprang out of the cabin but only in time to behold two quivering bodies
                  dangling almost touching one another from the same bough of a tree. It was his
                  brother and Flores.</p>
               <p>A couple of ragged rascals who had followed the two brothers from San<pb n="8-9"
                     xml:id="VAC8324-00000006"/> Francisco, with trumped-up receipts, had claimed
                  the mules they had been riding and sworn that the animals had been stolen from
                  them.</p>
               <p>Such was the fury of the mob, (for of course, where no law was except the
                  unnoticed Mexican alcaldes' which was too easily tampered with, justice had to be
                  dealt by themselves), that the victims had no chance to clear themselves, and all
                  their endeavors to put in a word of defence were drowned by the curses and groans
                  of the crowd. They were pulled off their horses, a couple of long grazing-halters
                  found somewhere flung over their heads as they were made to stand on barrel heads;
                  these scaffolds were kicked from under them, and thus they died.</p>
               <p>The two false accusers, bestriding the animals still warm in reins and saddle from
                  the innocent and real owners, rode off as quickly as possible, after treating the
                  crowd at the nearest rum-hole.</p>
               <p>Struck with horror and astonishment, Joaquin could do no more at first than cast
                  one glance on the bodies and the dispersing executioners to assure himself that
                  the sight was undesirably real; then, bursting into tears and restraining himself
                  from giving way to dangerous weakness, he procured a mule and returned to
                  Sacramento, on the way to San Francisco, and thence to the Mission, where he
                  embosomed himself of the awful story to his wife. It made her shudder; but, with
                  the eagerness of woman, she conjured her husband not to follow the path vengeance
                  streaked out to him with blood, but to leave to heaven the punishment of the
                  villams sure sooner or later to overtake them. She assured him that all Americans
                  were not, could not be as bloodthirsty as the assassins of her brother-in-law.</p>
               <p>With all the strength of her sincerely loving heart, she besought him not to yield
                  to criminal designs. Her tears, supplications and words of affection and
                  consolation worked a great change in Joaquin's intentions, and lulled his heart
                  into forgetfulness of the misdeed.</p>
               <p>"So be it," said he kissing her, "I yield to my good angel. All is over. Let's
                  forget and be happpy. As soon as I shall have gathered a little gold, we will go
                  home never to leave it more."</p>
               <p>A few days afterwards, accompanied by his wife, he reached the mines on the
                  Stanislaus River, where he put up a cabin and began "wet diggings."</p>
               <p>The district was extremely lively, agitated by a great number of wretches who,
                  covering themselves with the cloak of being Americans "down on yallow bellies, by
                  G—!" worked only by fits and starts, patrolling the country, and eyeing the native
                  Californians and Mexicans who did throw off sluggishness and take to labor, with a
                  hateful eye, while regarding them as a conquered race, good only when others had
                  the whip-hand of them.</p>
               <p>This scum did all they could to fan the flames of prejudice of color and the
                  innate antipathy of such opposite races.</p>
               <p>One day, a gang of such loafing desperadoes, having been thrashed soundly by an
                  allied party of Americans and Englishmen forming the "United E. Pluribus Dieu et
                  mon Unum Droit Mining Company," and smarting to find somebody to be revenged on,
                  came across solitary Joaquin and coolly ordered him to clear from his claim, as
                  they had made up their mind never to let a man of his skin scrape gold in that
                  region.</p>
               <p>As a show of his papers did no good, and his string of oaths more harm, he told
                  the shouting band plump that he'd see every man Jack of 'em at the bottom of a
                  Nevadan ravine with a ten-foot sand-drift covering them, before he'd let a spade
                  or a pick that had no business there break earth on his ground.</p>
               <p>Weapons flashed out, thereupon. There was a scuffle. The poor wife rushed out,
                  handsome in her terror and grief, to behold her husband senseless on the ground
                  from a hail of blows from pistol-butts. The miscreants seized her. When Joaquin
                  came to life at the dusk, Carmela was more than dead, dishonored!</p>

               </argument>
               <p>IMAGINE the feelings of the unfortunate Joaquin.</p>
               <p>Naturally, vengeance sent his blood up to boiling heat, but he had enough coolness
                  left to know that he could not single-handed quench his thirst for reprisal: that
                  would be risking life and liberty for one or two deaths alone. He forced himself
                  to wait and grin and bear it all until some chance should aid him to carry out his
                  ideas.</p>
               <p>In April, 1850, he went into Calaveras County and tried his hand at Murphy's
                  Diggings; but, seeing that he was not of the temperament that a good gold-hunter
                  must be, he gave up the wash-bowl and rocker and took to the less honest and far
                  less honorable monte table.</p>
               <p>Mexicans do not consider that so very disgraceful, however, as we may as well say.
                  At first blush, fortune more than smiled, laughed on him and began to make the
                  gold coins roll over decks of cards into the folds of his sash and the pockets of
                  his inner calzoneras, while his hat's lining was not innocent of some Bank of
                  England notes that he had bought as more convenient than the solid stuff, in spite
                  of the chant he heard so frequently in the saloons, the classical "Shove her up,
                  shove her up to the bolt, I'd rather have an ounce than a twenty-dollar note, for
                  the slug it will sink and the flimsy 'll float, so I'd rather have," etc.</p>
               <p>But, after going down the hill gaily, he had to go up toilsomely and had to
                  lighten his load. If he had dropped his gains into the melting pot, he could
                  hardly have had them more speedily melted away.</p>
               <p>He rolled into the depths of the gulf of crime.</p>
               <p>One day, he had been visiting a friend out of town, so to say, and had returned
                  riding a horse which Valenzuela his friend had loaned him. Just as he entered the
                  encampment-village of Murphy's Diggings, somebody raised a hullabaloo, a crowd
                  surrounded him and stopped him.</p>
               <p>"Hoss-thief!" cried Westerner. "I swan if 'taint my maire Kezi'ah, if 'tis shaved
                  pesky close and the fly-brush docked," yelled a Yankee. "Give the fellow a
                  hearing," said a Pennsylvanian. "Give the beggar a jolly good hiding," roared an
                  Englishman. "Smother him, the bastely Mixican," said a Patlander louder than
                  all.</p>
               <p>Everybody knew the animal, and all Joaquin could do was swear that he had only
                  borrowed it, and that no doubt Valenzuela had innocently come into possession.
                  Half the crowd, with the Westerner on his recovered horse; sped away to confront
                  Valenzuela. The rest, after listening for a few moments to the asseverations of
                  Joaquin, were going to let him off with threats alone, when several, who had seen
                  him idling about and only busy when cards in hand, insisted on giving him a round
                  dozen lashes as a slight warning for him to quit those diggings.</p>
               <p>So they tied up the luckless young man to a tree, and an English sailor, who knew
                  something of cats, rigged up a whip from an old hairless buffalo robe, and
                  inflicted the whipping. They let the flogged Sonorian go, then. It was lucky for
                  him, for the others returned before long from Valenzuela's shanty. He had been
                  unable to satisfy them, and they had run him up to the lowermost branch of a
                  cedar, and had hurried back to give his supposed accomplice a similar
                  necklace.</p>
               <p>Joaquin's passionate spirit underwent a fearful change never to be altered<pb
                     n="10-11" xml:id="VAC8324-00000007"/> afterwards. Any barrier whatever lost
                  power over his raging heart. He took an oath only to live thenceforth for revenge
                  and to mark his steps in blood. He could not discriminate in his general scheme,
                  and included all the Saxons in his doom-roll.</p>
               <p>Not very long afterwards the stout Englishman, who had proposed the "jolly
                  hiding," was leisurely strolling into the thinned out woods, on a fine
                  evening.</p>
               <p>As he descended into the ravine crossing the narrow path, he found himself
                  unexpectedly face to face with Joaquin, whom he could not help remembering. The
                  eyes of the sallow youth flashed like a tawny tiger's, and a shudder made his
                  whole frame vibrate.</p>
               <p>The Briton was fascinated for the moment, but, noting the trembling of the other,
                  he set it down to the fear the latter might have of being captured again.</p>
               <p>"I ain't a-goin' to tetch yer, friend Spaniard," said he, and he pushed on to pass
                  him, almost unconcernedly.</p>
               <p>Joaquin, side by side with him, did draw aloof from the path as though to give him
                  passage, but it was really to have a fair sweeping stab at the man's side.</p>
               <p>"Oh!" and the stout fellow reeled and clapped one hand to his breast, while the
                  other felt in his belt.</p>
               <p>"Die! die!" yelled Joaquin, foaming at the mouth and tearing away at his victim
                  with his left hand, while his right brought down the dagger again and again till
                  the victim was borne to the ground.</p>
               <p>"What've I done to you, you butcher?" muttered the dying man. "Mercy ——
                  spare!"</p>
               <p>"Did you spare me," returned Joaquin, pressing at the gasping throat and winding
                  himself round the other's sturdier form like a liana round a tamarack, or a snake
                  round a stung prairie dog; "did you spare me when you wanted them to whip me like
                  a horse, when you had a whole crowd to back you against me, one innocent man? Was
                  you full of mercy then? I didn't see you telling them to lay on the lashes more
                  lightly, or to be short in the number prescribed! No, by our Lady of Suffering, my
                  brother and my wife are dead through just such devils as you, and I'll out-devil
                  ye, by G—! You've set me a-fire by calling to mind my Carmela! (stab!) my brother!
                  (stab!) Die, die! wretch!"</p>
               <p>Mad, Joaquin kept on perforating and hacking the temple, out of which by too many
                  entries already the soul had fled, and he only stopped at last when his soaked
                  sleeve, and streaming knife wet his painted and tired hand.</p>
               <p>"There, that begins my work of death," said he, getting up from the pool of blood
                  in which the murdered man almost floated.</p>
               <p>Joaquin's teeth chattered convulsively, his body was drawn up to its full height,
                  and he swept with fired eye the beautiful azure dome of the Californian sky. His
                  clenched, stained hand still brandished the clotted blade.</p>
               <p>"Number one of the doomed at my feet!" cried he. "Now that I've had a taste of the
                  feast, I'll keep at it till I clear the table! Oh, dearly-loved Carmela, if your
                  pure, too-soon fled spirit seeks revenge, watch over me and protect me in your
                  battles as much as mine, Carlos, brother, poor, dead brother, put your strengh in
                  my arm!"</p>
               <p>Next morning, the first party out after firewood found the corpse, which, although
                  so horribly mangled, was recognised.</p>
               <p>As he had been so prominent in the chastisement of the supposed partner in the
                  horse-theft, was a good enough fellow otherwise, and did not seem to have been
                  robbed, the crime was attributed to the true author, which fact did not much
                  encourage an idea of the Mexicans not being of an assassinating turn of mind.</p>
               <p>A little later, a doctor, who was coming to Murphy's with "Salvator's Specific for
                  spasmodic fevers," and other quick remedies, galloped in among the workmen to the
                  music of gasps for help, a clatter of broken bottles and the neighing of his mare,
                  on whose flanks the camphene, spirits and gums of the let-out medicines had
                  streamed, soaking through the saddle-bags.</p>
               <p>He had met a couple of Mexicans on horseback, who had no sooner excharged a "Buena
                  tarde!" with him than they drew pistols and blazed away. His nag had an ear
                  tipped, and he received a bullet through his tall felt hat; he was saved by a
                  small inch.</p>
               <p>He had not, as might be expected, taken a daguerreotype (photographs were unknown)
                  of the marksmen, but he had remarked enough of the better shot of the two for him
                  to be proclaimed, on that description, to be the Englishman's murderer,
                  Joaquin.</p>
               <p>There was a general excitement among the set who had been chiefs of the torturers
                  of the Sonorian, and some of <emph>them</emph> felt such dread creep over them and
                  weigh upon them that they were noticed to be always with friends and not apt to
                  pass the last tent of the encampment.</p>
               <p>Those that did not care went and came as ever, but, somehow or other, a mysterious
                  unavoidable fate hung over them and hardly were they out of sight and earshot of
                  help, then death fell sharp and unerring upon them.</p>
               <p>Consternation began to spread. Every new arrival had a report to make of a dead
                  body or two having been encountered on the road, "knifed or bulletted," and it was
                  always found that the victims were those who had had something to do with the
                  whipping of Joaquin.</p>
               <p>Judge Lynch called together a court, and the Sonorian was outlawed, and compelled
                  to find security only in flight or in a continuance of his murderous career.</p>
               <p>As he could not well accomplish his black plans without money and horses, he had
                  to add theft to his other crime. Thus was he a highwayman before he was
                  twenty.</p>
               <p>So, in 1851, the band of robbers that ravaged the country was well known to be
                  commanded by Joaquin.</p>
               <p>Prospecting parties and others changing from mine to mine were rarely so strong as
                  not to be stopped on the way and made to deliver.</p>
               <p>The returners from the diggings were eased of their hard-earned treasure and
                  considered themselves lucky if they were let go back to resume work, half stripped
                  and with nothing to pledge to procure tools.</p>
               <p>Most of the lonely travelers, and especially Johnny Newcomes who were not up to
                  the new life, were torn from their saddles by lariats and pulled into the brush to
                  be "stuck" and rifled at leisure.</p>
               <p>Horses vanished from the ranches, of which not a few were burnt, and King, Queen
                  or President Pillage (just as you like) began to act as if he, or she, ruled the
                  Golden State.</p>
               <p>Joaquin's intelligence and superior education, very naturally, had almost
                  instantly won for him respect from his comrades. He cunningly made an appeal to
                  the rankling against the "Yankees," as the stupid Mexicans styled all the fair
                  complexioned and States' people, whether from Red River of the North, the Rio
                  Grande, the Merrimac, the Hudson or all along the Ohio, the Mississippi and the
                  shore of the Great Lakes.</p>
               <p>The disastrous result of the Texan War had been very peppery dish for them to
                  digest, and, by the call of Joaquin, he collected many fellow countrymen,
                  respectable in numbers if in nothing else. His undreamt-of successes recruited his
                  ranks day after day, till his slight form had a train to it like a slave clipper
                  followed by sharks.</p>
               <p>Among his followers, was to be remarked a young stripling of the name of Reynardo
                  Felix, own brother to Joaquin's wife, who burned like his near kinsman to avenge
                  her dreadful death. He was one of the lieutenants, and got his name up by his
                  repeated exploits at the head of a troop, side by side with that<pb n="12-13"
                     xml:id="VAC8324-00000008"/> of Three-fingered Jack, another bandit who had come
                  to Joaquin's standard from sheer love of blood-spilling.</p>
               <p>This Mexican "Obi" was more of a fiend than a human being. He was known in Mexico
                  as Manuel Garcia, where he had had one finger cut off in a skirmish of guerrillas,
                  who had been a little mistaken in an idea which they had had of catching a
                  detachment of Uncle Sam's "blue-bellies" napping; hence the nickname he sported in
                  El Dorado.</p>
               <p>It was he, who, in '46, in company with half a dozen other cutthroats, fell upon
                  two Americans on the road from Sonora to Bodega, stripped them to the skin and
                  tortured them in so many and such ways that the papers never dared print all:
                  slicing them with daggers, cutting out their tongues and eyes, and concluding by
                  roasting their still animated, but lacerated bodies, over a slow fire of green
                  wood.</p>
               <p>We may as well name here, as being satellites of Joaquin, Pedro Gonzales, Luis
                  Guerra, Juan Cardoza and Joaquin Valenzuela, fearless fellows—when they
                  outnumbered the foe or were cornered, cunning—but every coward's that, hardened to
                  fatigue by a life of poverty and laziness, ardent for vengeance.</p>
               <p>The last named was brother to the man who had been hanged on the day when Joaquin
                  had been flogged. He had served a good while in Mexico with Guerra, in the
                  guerrillero band of Padre Jurata, a monk who had forgotten vows of abstinence and
                  goodness made under the crucifix to make money and torture women under the
                  lancier's red flag.</p>
               <p>Gonzalez, above-mentioned, whose principal qualification was a knowledge of
                  horseflesh—of which he ought to have known some trifle, from his having stampeded
                  and stolen so many of them—was charged to keep the company of cutthroats always
                  well mounted.</p>
               <p>Besides, he carried on the befitting and courageous business of a sneaking spy
                  and, from whatever quarter the band thought of visiting, sent in an exact report
                  of the state of it, to procure which he hung around Regulators, Committees of
                  Vigilance, Redressors, Lynehers, Shirt-tail Bend Justices, as closely as he could
                  without being <emph>hung</emph> up.</p>
               <p>Joaquin's command was composed of no less than five-and-forty men then, but every
                  week saw additions from Sonora and Lower California, along with roamers of the
                  Gila, who had found meddling with Bill Williams's, Kit Carson and other marksmen
                  whose pieces carried six to eight dead shots to a pound, did not "pay," in this
                  world, at least. Leading this powerful flock of vultures, Joaquin, in the course
                  of the year '51, rattled over the State, which was more gold than "grizzly" to him
                  just then, when the black sand was "half and half" auriferous dust in the common
                  bowl, when cradles had their receiver covered with a quarter inch of pea-size
                  pepitas, when the veins made lucky chaps jump and treat a crowd of thirty on the
                  strength of "opening so rich," when "salting" claims to catch the pig-tail
                  Celestials hardly was tried, folks were selfish and let strangers be butchered and
                  plundered within a few miles of them. Too many said:</p>
               <p>"The h—! that bloody greaser's killed another on the Smitty's Flats! Blast the
                  show-no fights! let Joe Quin, or Walk-in, or whatever he's called, come an' lay
                  paw on our waist-belts an' I'll be dog gone'd but he'll be cracked like those
                  finger-long fleas the Irishman left us in this here shanty we bought o' him. Fetch
                  him on hereaway!"</p>
               <p>The numerous persons with whom the King of Cutthroats was on a good footing could
                  not suspect, seeing him so frequently among them, that this young man had any
                  share in the sanguinary deeds which were past count by this time and which
                  affected a whole state. He remained whole weeks in one place, spending his time in
                  gaming, utterly unknown for what he was. For instance, in the summer of 1851,
                  while he was living in a remote house in the town of San Jose, he was arrested one
                  night for being concerned in a "muss" happening at the heat of a midnight
                  fandango.</p>
               <p>The magistrate, before whom they were all brought, sentenced him to a fine of
                  twelve dollars. Joaquin desired Sheriff Clark, in whose charge he was placed, to
                  come along with him to his dwelling, where he would count out the sum and a little
                  more for the trouble he had caused. They went side by side, chatting gaily, but,
                  as soon as they came to a spot that offered concealment, Joaquin whipped out his
                  knife, quickly told Clark that he had only led him there to slay him, and gave him
                  a death-wound before the Sheriff could draw the Derringer on which he had already
                  laid his hand. Mr. Clark had made himself hated as well as feared by the
                  highwaymen from the careful watch which he had kept over their attempts in his
                  district and as he had come several times unpleasantly near to arresting some of
                  them, their leader had thus taken advantage of his opportunity to clear the stream
                  of that top-sawyer.</p>
               <p>Some months thereafter, Joaquin settled for the time being near that bunching of
                  tents and huts known under the <emph>sonorous</emph> title of Sonorian
                  Camping-ground, three or four miles out from Marysville.</p>
               <p>Pretty soon, everybody began to talk of murders, as frequent as diabolical. From
                  the seventh to the twelfth of November, 1851, in a stretch of land not more than a
                  dozen miles each way, there were no less than eleven persons found slaughtered by
                  the mysterious troop.</p>
               <p>The stout hearts of Marysville, as generous to avenge as brave to act, determined
                  not to let the crimes drop to the ground as had been done in other places.</p>
               <p>A company was formed to run down and hand over to justice those who shed so much
                  guiltless blood.</p>
               <p>Poor fellows! brave-hearted men who had left happy homes to seek a fortune for
                  loved wife and children, to be slain at the threshold of the riches which their
                  strong arms, nerved with honest desire, affection and industry, would have surely
                  given them!</p>
               <p>The avengers thought——for this struck <emph>home</emph> to them——of women waiting,
                  waiting for letters that never came, for husbands, brothers, sons that never came.
                  Next steamer, sure! No? then, next ship that comes round the Horn. No? Then, he's
                  crossing the plains, no roads, Indians, something's delayed him. Oh, he's sure to
                  come! he <emph>must</emph> come!</p>
               <p>Poor hopeful ones! you are surer to meet him, than he you. There's a bit of plank
                  mouldering away in the bank of a golden sandy stream, there's a big stone on this
                  hillock's side, a heap of pebbles on that road; nicknames scrawled affectionately
                  if rudely by loving "mates" who laid aside tools to take the red chalk in horny
                  fingers, are all those poor gravestones bear, and no one knows, though they may
                  guess, that for little "Pet Pete" a heart broke slowly and sadly in the East; that
                  for "Georgia Ned" the Etowah River bore a self drowned darling of a brunette on
                  the way to the Coosa and the Gulf, if the gar fish, had not attacked it and
                  canoemen recovered it to sadden a whole plantation with; that for this, that or
                  the other unknown, she with the golden hair wasted away in that city, she with the
                  black curls is a widow unmarried, she with the brown tresses is grey before
                  thirty.</p>
               <p>Enough that the Redressors felt this far better than we can say, and were untiring
                  of foot.</p>
               <p>After many day's researches, they only found, not far from the muddy ripple of the
                  creek, six men, dead, with that livid circle round the neck and horridly distorted
                  features which betrayed the lasso.</p>
               <p>The whole of Yuba County was overrun, and yet not trace was found of the
                  murderers. The party returned to Marysville, disbanding with regret.</p>
               <p>But, the very next day, news spread that several persons had been killed and
                  despoiled near Bidwell's Bar, whereupon the excitement grew greater.</p>
               <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC8324-00000009"/>
               <p>Few dared to travel.</p>
               <p>Suspicions began to settle towards the Camp of the Sonorians, exclusively occupied
                  by Mexicans as it was, for——without much striking with picks or dabbling in the
                  river's sands——a great number of them possessed steeds of value, magnificent
                  serapes or blankets, costly Panamas, plenty of jewelry and gold in large
                  quantities.</p>
               <p>Buchanan, Sheriff of Yuba County, set out on one beautiful moonlight night, with
                  Ike Bowen, to have an inspection of the place, and to arrest three very suspicious
                  fellows who were known to be in that neighborhood.</p>
               <p>But, as they were getting over a stockade, four Mexicans sprang upon them unawares
                  and the Sheriff fell to the ground seriously wounded with a pistol bullet through
                  the body.</p>
               <p>The Mexicans took to flight at the charge of Ike, who turned and attacked them
                  single-handed. Buchanan, carried back to Marysville by his companion, was a long
                  time in danger, but eventually recovered. The consequence of this affair was that
                  the ravagers did not stay any longer in those parts.</p>
               <p>They stole off to the western side of Mount Shasta, where they kept secluded for
                  several months, only going down into the valleys at rare intervals to steal
                  horses. Few miners passed through that retired region, but, nevertheless, there
                  were found more than one bleached skeleton of human beings.</p>
               <p>Some bore no trace of how they had been put to death, but the splintered holes and
                  the dislocated vertebal of others revealed the secret work of lasso and
                  bullet.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>TRIP INTO SONORA.—CARMELA'S SUCCESSOR.—IN THE OLD NEST AGAIN.—DEFIANCE IN THE
                     HELL.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS the first days of the spring of '52 came on, Joaquin and his band descended
                  from the highlands, with nearly three hundred horses stolen during the rainy
                  season. Taking care only to travel by night, they led this drove through the
                  southern part of the state into the province of Sonora. On their return after a
                  few weeks, the depredators pitched their head-quarters in the magnificent country
                  of richest pastures, known as Arroyo Cantuva.</p>
               <p>It was a vale of seven or eight thousand acres in extent, well watered and
                  enclosed all around by a belt of mountains, which had no other gap than one, where
                  the plunderers could hold an army at check. This fertile hollow is situated
                  between the passes of Pacheco and Tejon, east of the main range and west of Tulan
                  Lake.</p>
               <p>Wholly hidden by the pile of rock, it formed a refuge all the more sure from no
                  dwelling being within fifty leagues.</p>
               <p>Game abounded there: the grizzly often clattered with his long claws over the
                  granite, deer, antelopes, big-horns, mountain sheep, the pretty plumed California
                  quails, wood-cock, and a whole series of lesser animals seemingly put there for
                  the food of man. Hence, as far as eating went, theives had a good time of it.</p>
               <p>Under the speading foliage of a clump of evergreens, the young chief fixed his
                  cabin.</p>
               <p>More than once, he was to be seen, in the cool of a fine day, reclining on the
                  carpet of verdant sward which Nature had smoothly laid over the floor of that
                  Eden; by his side was a young woman, fair and affectionate, of whom he had made
                  the conquest in his late visit to Sonora.</p>
               <p>Clarina, for that was her name, was the daughter of Don Sebastian Vallero, a
                  grandee of Spain who after having empoverished himself through his excessive
                  prodigality, had withdrawn to Mexico with the modest remnant of his fortune, where
                  he had purchased a piece of ground quite near the rancho of Joaquin's father.</p>
               <p>The first time that the girl was led into contact with the youth, though he was
                  but fifteen and she ten then, she could not help admiring——for the girls are women
                  very early under 30 degrees north latitude——the graceful figure and alluring face
                  of Joaquin, as well as the ease and elegance with which he managed his half-wild
                  horse; everytime that they met, she could not help gazing on him in passion akin
                  to worship.</p>
               <p>But the youth's large blue eyes only answered with an indifferent glance a shade
                  mocking, and the bright red flush of his cheeks did not have so pure a cause as
                  the gentle but deep blush that suffused her features.</p>
               <p>The poor little romantic thing had felt her heart leap often and often again while
                  reading the old tales of the knight errants; and her governess had only fed her
                  poetical learning by teaching her many of the favorite ballads and legends of
                  antique Spain.</p>
               <p>A couple that were all the time rising to her lips in her perfumed breath were: <q>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"While his hand lightly struck the mandoline,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Came singing so joyful the troubadour;</l>
                        <l>'Spared from Saracen's blades in Palestine</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">I turn to my love like hawk to the lure.'</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"At the door of her grand house</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Stood the gentle damosel,</l>
                        <l>Spying with her great black eyes</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">The youths who loved her so well."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>When she watched every morning the departure of Joaquin and his fellows nothing
                  was easier for Clarina to imagine than that the party was one of chevaliers going
                  out to battle; but, on the return, it was impossible for her to fancy that it was
                  her love's esquire, that young man who brought no trophies to her and was far from
                  coming to kneel at her feet. Grief and melancholy overcame her and tears obscured
                  the diamond lustre of her eyes in which they swam till dropping from the long
                  lashes, roses she had gathered——for him who never held out a finger for them——fell
                  to her feet while her hand, empty of them, rose to her bosom.</p>
               <p>So she sorrowed, unable to tell or even hint at her emotion.</p>
               <p>Some years later, as Joaquin was on the point of quitting the paternal roof with
                  the woman of his choice and was bidding farewell to his friends and relations,
                  Clarina, her heart ready to burst with sadness, thrust a gold ring on Joaquin's
                  finger and——as he looked at her startled and in inquiry——she, like a won an, ran
                  away to her room to seek relief in prayer and tears.</p>
               <p>Joaquin saw in this jewel merely a mark of friendship intended for his wife and he
                  hastened to hand it over to her; but, perceiving that the circlet seemed to be one
                  of those precious talismans to which the Castilian nobles attach such value,
                  Carmela refused it and begged her husband to wear it for her sake.</p>
               <p>"The trinket may have some virtue unknown to us, and perhaps will be a shield in
                  some hour of peril," she said superstitiously.</p>
               <p>Joaquin smiled incredulously, at the time, but he never gave over wearing the
                  asserted charm until the fatal hour preceding his death.</p>
               <p>Once, however, he did forget it, and that was the day on which he was so
                  shamefully treated at Murphy's Diggings.</p>
               <p>The gem had been left in his room among other jewelry in a casket. Since then,
                  Joaquin, obeying the promptings of superstition, could not doubt that the little
                  round had in verity power to preserve him from dangers.</p>
               <p>When Joaquin went home, he spent the first day and the morning of the next<pb
                     n="16-17" xml:id="VAC8324-00000010"/> in visits to old neighbors, to whom he
                  could naturally make many rich presents out of his store of stolen goods.</p>
               <p>As soon as the heat of the day was over, and the exquisite hours came when the
                  feeling in the shade of the woods can only be expressed by the words "just right,"
                  Joaquin strolled into the forest to treat himself to the re-awakening of pleasant
                  memories.</p>
               <p>He gased enchanted on the endless clumps of different cactus, on the nopals in
                  blossom, on palmettos, pines, cedars, oaks, dogwoods, on pond lilies, rushes,
                  reeds and all the varieties of grass befringing the waters of Capivi Creek.</p>
               <p>Its now rapid running current washed the luxuriantly budded sides with its
                  back-waters, and reflected the taller trees in its depths. Myriads of birds most
                  brightly feathered hovered overhead, darted from side to side, fluttered close to
                  the ground or sprang from bough to bough in the scented air, that mingled its
                  odors with the multitude of songs.</p>
               <p>Every now and then, a long fish, pursued by same chuckle-headed bristling-jawed
                  enemy eager for dinner, would spring out of the eddy and glitter in a slanting
                  sunbeam, silver-white, golden-yellow or steel-blue. And sometimes, a hawk or
                  eagle——though oftener the king-fisher——would give a scream that sent all the
                  songsters scuttling under cover, and after a sweep or two, drop like a heaven-shot
                  dart, skim the ruffled whirls and streaks and rise into air once more with a
                  luckless wriggling plate of silver, hooked and nailed by the beak. The
                  wood-peckers were at work in the far-off, everywhere, tattooing trees to come at
                  the grubs.</p>
               <p>Joaquin felt gradually stealing over him a forgetfulness of the immediately past,
                  but a strengthening of boyhood's recollections. He pelted the screaming birds with
                  pebbles (perhaps valuable, for Sonora has wonders yet to unfold), listened
                  enraptured to the warbling of others, snapped off a cluster of berries here,
                  sliced a fruit there, drank at a spring, leaped over stones, swung himself by
                  creepers, and carried on like a boy, in a word.</p>
               <p>No one would ever have believed him a bandit chief. He had left the stream
                  unconsciously, and desirous of regaining it, he let himself yield to a species of
                  fit of sprightliness, and ran at full speed down an open hill upon the very
                  bank.</p>
               <p>He just was able to pull up short there and not take an unpremediated dive, when a
                  half suppressed scream, as if caused by the swish of the pebbles which his feet
                  had shot into the ripple, attracted his eyes to the other side. It is unnecessary
                  to say that those eyes, thither drawn, were rivetted there in ravishment.</p>
               <p>A young girl had raised that cry of surprise. She had been dressing, and was half
                  attired, on the wavelet's edge, when he had made the rush to the place.</p>
               <p>So he saw in disarray, trembling but fascinated to the spot, a female form
                  youthful and beautiful. Face, neck and arms darker than the rest of the
                  faultlessly proportioned frame, but that of a warm, tempting tint.</p>
               <p>Fine and delicate features, magnificent black hair but not as silky as it might
                  be, for the sun seemed to have robbed it of gloss, eyes superior to Indian's or
                  Mexican's, velvelty in the pupil somehow or other at the same time as liquid, and
                  lustrous, the pearly teeth revealed from the mouth being parted with surprise,
                  most lithesome of forms, a child's feet and hands——all more than half
                  uncovered——that's the picture that appeared to Joaquin.</p>
               <p>Only for the briefest space, though, for the scream was repeated, and, catching up
                  the rest of her apparel, the beauty darted into the wood.</p>
               <p>So suddenly was she seen, so briefly viewed, so abruptly gone, that the young man
                  almost doubted his vision. But the floating of a scarf and some other part of
                  attire dropped in the fugitive's haste, were proofs of reality.</p>
               <p>"By heaven, I must see her again!" muttered Joaquin.</p>
               <p>As he spoke, he kicked off his riding boots, flung them over the creek, wound his
                  blanket round him to shield his pistols, and such a vigorous spring into the water
                  that he cleared the line separating the side-tow from the main line.</p>
               <p>It was hard swimming in the current, and the delay it caused him in reaching the
                  other shore, as well as a coolness which the stream, running under trees rather
                  than laying under the sun, possessed, set him thinking of the two or three
                  splashes he heard round and about him.</p>
               <p>"It'll look well for Joaquin the Terror of the Miners to be dragged under by
                  caiman or stung by a water-snake!" muttered he, redoubling his efforts.</p>
               <p>He reached land presently. The black spots on the surface that had caused him
                  anxiety were only bits of rotten limbs tumbled in from trees. He ran along breast
                  deep into the whirls till he recovered the objects.</p>
               <p>"Silk and first rate," muttered he examining the scarf; "no common girl, then. I
                  wonder who she is. So lovely—Caramba! She didn't have her feet covered—poor little
                  dear—and I think I'll find her near."</p>
               <p>He trailed the fugitive for a short ways, but lost the track.</p>
               <p>"D—if her steps ain't light as air," he murmured. "I say, friend, young lady,
                  senorita! I am a gentleman won't hurt you—here, here!"</p>
               <p>But no answer came to his calls. A little chilled by the soaking he had got,
                  though his pistols had not been wetted through the blanket, he, grumbling at the
                  vanished one's fear but reveling in remembrance of her beauty, was slowly tracing
                  his route through the underwood when a shriek, most intense and far-reaching, came
                  to his ears.</p>
               <p>"The deuce! can some of my rascals be on the loose and met her!" cried he,
                  frowning and laying his hand on his weapons.</p>
               <p>Like a dart, he flew through thorns and creepers. At last, he saw the white
                  drapery of the beauty, who was dressed now.</p>
               <p>But, most singularly she was not looking back at him, although she could hardly
                  help hearing his swift coming.</p>
               <p>She stood firm as a statue, but quivering like a leaf, her limbs close together,
                  her body drawn back, one arm across her bosom and the fingers half veiling some
                  awful thing from her view, while the other hand was put forward outside of that to
                  repel the same cause of dread.</p>
               <p>"Courage!" said Joaquin, suspecting the whole, and advancing less noisily though
                  no less rapidly.</p>
               <p>A dark round line twisted into the form of an S with an extra curl at the foot of
                  it terminating in a wiry point and another flourish at the top bearing a head with
                  spiteful beads of glaring eyes and a vibrating tongue, rested itself on a rotted
                  plantain leaf.</p>
               <p>It eyed the girl, and she it.</p>
               <p>At the sound of the man's steps, the serpent moved, altered its S into an upside
                  down <figure/> (J), and was about to disappear.</p>
               <p>A low "Ah!" of relief escaped from the girl's lips.</p>
               <p>"No, you don't!" cried Joaquin, springing forward.</p>
               <p>The reptile stopped and turned its head fearlessly around, and darted out its
                  shiny red tongue, as much as to say it made no difference at all whether it was
                  asked to stay or was let go on.</p>
               <p>"No, no," exclaimed the girl, finding speech, and laying her hand on Joaquin's
                  arm, "its a moccasin snake!"</p>
               <p>But the young man shook off the gentle hold, fell upon one knee within two yards
                  of the serpent, and leveled the revolver which he had drawn. The snake drew up its
                  folds calmly, and lengthened its wavy tongue more and more.</p>
               <p>Joaquin saw what was coming, but seemed to be too sure of his triumphing to care
                  for that.</p>
               <p>"Quick!" the girl uttered in horror as she saw the deadly animal move, but her
                  words were drowned by a sharp report.</p>
               <p>The moccasin, received in the very act of springing by the bullet and a line of<pb
                     n="18-19" xml:id="VAC8324-00000011"/> fire and smoke fell to the ground, the
                  tail-half perfect enough, but the head and rest blown into pieces which blackened
                  and spotted the leaves and ground.</p>
               <p>That snake was harmless henceforth, for the poison-bag even had been burst to
                  nothing.</p>
               <p>Now, the rescued girl was Clarina.</p>
               <p>Fancy the walk towards home of the two.</p>
               <p>She had remarked, first thing, that her ring was upon her deliverer's finger, and
                  she did not hesitate to jump at the conclusion that he loved her.</p>
               <p>So she confessed the state of her heart at the opening of their conversation.</p>
               <p>While Joaquin had been in California, he had kept his family informed of most of
                  what happened to him and his, so that Clarina was award of his wife being dead
                  and, moreover, that he had become a notorious bandit. But, notwithstanding his
                  undoubtedly criminal career, Clarina was enamoured of him still.</p>
               <p>He, for his part, had been inspired with his glimpse of her bathing, that he
                  yielded to her influence and found it no hard matter to throw himself at her knees
                  and declare that his first love was only a died away passion and that this time
                  was the first that he knew what true affection was.</p>
               <p>Hence, the two are found by us, seated on the moss and grass under the trees of
                  Arroyo Cantuva. Carmela's name was already forgotten, and all her tenderness,
                  faithfulness and devotion were banished from the robber's mind.</p>
               <p>After several weeks spent at their headquarters. Joaquin divided his troops, then
                  composed of seventy-five, into detatchments, of which he gave the commands to
                  Valenzuela, Luis Guerra and Three-fingered Jack, sending them to fall upon certain
                  points.</p>
               <p>Their order was to employ their time solely in running off horses and mules, his
                  attention being to put into execution a plan of his that required from fifteen
                  hundred to two thousand of the cattle.</p>
               <p>He started off himself in another direction, accompanied by Reynardo, Felix, Juan
                  Cardoza, and Pedro Gonzalez. Three women disguised as men and well armed like
                  their escorts, formed part also of this company: the first was Clarina, and the
                  others the respective mistresses of Felix and Gonzales. All were admirably
                  mounted.</p>
               <p>None except the chief knew the aim of their course.</p>
               <p>On arriving at Mokelumne Hill, Calaveras County, they mingled with the Mexicans
                  who dwelt there, all of whom were friendly as a matter of course, and, when they
                  went the rounds of the gaming hells or traveled the streets, it was impossible to
                  distinguished them from the more honest inhabitants of the place. The women
                  re-assumed the habiliments of their sex and behaved themselves so excessively well
                  that they became almost wonders on that account. The men went out on expeditions
                  every little while on their splendid horses and always made a long circuit before
                  returning to their rendevous.</p>
               <p>Joaquin had the semblance of a gambler in high feather, as his nocturnal rovings
                  gave him the means to appear.</p>
               <p>This was April, 1852.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, the other divisions were pursuing ardently their mission in the
                  different quarters, and Joaquin found in the papers (the humble parents of the
                  well-conducted, enterprising journals of the present day) full accounts and
                  pleasing ones to him of how ranches had been rid of stock to a great extent.</p>
               <p>Besides, the public sheets did not hesitate to lay the whole on his shoulders.</p>
               <p>In the different murders and thefts in which he had taken a personal part, he had
                  always appeared under disguises, from which it resulted that he never less
                  resembled his masks than when he was the Simon Pure, indeed, a man who had a good
                  look at him on the highway, would have been unable to point finger at him in the
                  crowd of a town.</p>
               <p>Often he had mixed in with a group, and overhead excited conversations in which he
                  alone was talked of, many a secret laugh he enjoyed at the suppositions he caught
                  of his appearance, manner of living and designs.</p>
               <p>After having given as much time to Mokelumne Hill as he had intended, preparations
                  were made to leave it on the first of May.</p>
               <p>About midnight—while the horses were being got ready, and the women put on men's
                  clothes, and the rest of the arrangements being completed—Joaquin made a farewell
                  trip into the gambling dens and drinking-houses, which were only too plenty in the
                  rough "days of the discovery."</p>
               <p>He was taking his ease at a monte table, on which he had carelessly cast a small
                  sum to kill time when all of a sudden his attention was attracted from the painted
                     <unclear>paste</unclear>-board to a corner, where he heard his name pronounced
                  distinctly. His gaze stopped on four or five men who were warmly, but in a low
                  tone, discusing the doings of the Miners' murderer.</p>
               <p>There was one of them, a tall, well-built fellow, a dagger-knife and a revolver of
                  the newest style in his belt, his trousers stuffed into huge cow-hide boots that
                  seemed to tell of the overland route, who was perhaps the loudest-voiced.</p>
               <p>"Look a here boys," said he, "you all know me as Jack Gabriel, and they all know
                  me up an' down <unclear>both</unclear> banks of the Washita from the Lousian'
                  border up. I'm good for three ounces, ain't I? O' course, I am. Well, I'll down
                  with that dust to any one as'll set me face to face with this ——, ——, ——, (oaths)
                  Joaquin!"</p>
               <p>As the words were uttered, the audacious outlaw, jumped up on the table sending
                  the different leaves of the "devil's prayer-book" on the tobacco'd floor a leetle
                  promiscuously, and the money along with it, for which half a dozen heads instantly
                  bobbed down—threw his breast open by drawing aside his vest, held a capped
                  revolver, with the hammer set, in his right hand and shouted:</p>
               <p>"Keep the stand! I am Joaquin! Fire if you dare!"</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding the defiance, the young adventurer was not such a fool as not to
                  take advantage of the general confusion that prevailed for the moment.</p>
               <p>He pulled his sarape round him quickly, took a grand flying leap from the
                  table—which was smashed under the on-coming boots of Arkansas Jack—and, slipping
                  through the door, jumped upon his horse. There was some delay given his followers
                  from their own haste jamming them in the doorway, and all they could do was jerk
                  up their hands and try a salute of snap shots at the gallopers, but he had the
                  luck to escape a single scratch and the only satisfaction that his enemies
                  received in exchange for their wasted "Dupont's superfine granulated," was a yell
                  of defiance shrill and prolonged that echoed in the night air.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>ON gaining the trysting-place at Arroyo Cantuva, Joaquin found between three and
                  four hundred horses driven in by his men. The latter were encamped and waiting for
                  fresh instructions. The Chief of the Coyotes selected a part to drive the captures
                  into Sonora for the greater safety, and at the same time had sent one of his
                  secret bankers in the same place five thousand dollars.</p>
               <p>About the end of the month, idleness began to grow heavy upon him, and he could
                  bear inaction no longer. He took to the highway again, still accompanied by
                  Gonzales, Felix, Cardoza and the three young women, who formed, as they bestrode
                  their steeds with limbs perhaps too plump and shapely, the prettiest trio of
                  cavaliers that ever cantered into a maid's heart.</p>
               <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC8324-00000012"/>
               <p>For the first ten days, the gang met no persons except unlucky diggers changing
                  off from one mine to another, who were to a man to be smelt of poverty a mile off,
                  they were so redolent of lack of cash. Hence Joaquin's purse remained in so flat a
                  shape that he determined to fall upon the first man, Chinaman or Jew, ex-soldier
                  or ex-sailor, miner or speculator, or even a robber, for the wolf was so famished
                  that it was ready to bite wolf.</p>
               <p>Towards dusk, a young man, Allan Ruddell, made his appearance, driving a
                  wagon-load of provisions. Joaquin left his friends, put his horse to the gallop
                  and, taking a short cut, came upon the teamster suddenly.</p>
               <p>"I'll trouble you to turn over to me all the cash you've got about you," accested
                  he.</p>
               <p>Ruddell took a squint at the challenger and, seeing a young blade who seemed to be
                  only a novice at the worthy calling of Dick Turpin, Claude Duval and
                  Sixteen-stringed Jack and, in America, Mike Martin, he smiled to himself and "took
                  a fly off" the rump of one of his horses with his heavy rawhide-whip. Joaquin
                  pushed forward along side of him and, drawing his revolver then, commanded in a
                  brutal, peremptory tone:</p>
               <p>"Stand, and deliver?"</p>
               <p>Ruddell pulled up short.</p>
               <p>"Now, see here, my friend," said the young desperado, in a gentler voice, "all I
                  want to do is borrow your money; for, though I am a toll-gatherer on the roads of
                  my own taxes, I never like to relieve of his gold a brave man—and I am sure you
                  are one to travel the roads alone. As true as my name's Joaquin, I will repay you
                  every cent of what you lend me."</p>
               <p>"Joaquin, eh?" muttered Ruddell, clapping his hand on the stock of his pistol.</p>
               <p>Joaquin made a threatening motion.</p>
               <p>"Come, none of your nonsense!" exclaimed he. "I am not often 'shoal on the bar,'
                  and you may rely on my promise. I have no wish to kill you, but if you take to
                  pop-guns, by Our Lady, you'll go toes up most certainly!"</p>
               <p>Ruddell was not the man to take a robber's advice when it related to a game two
                  could play at; and he tried to pull out his fire-arm, but the confounded hammer
                  had worked into the lining of his pants and he could not disengage it.</p>
               <p>At this moment, Reynards Felix thundered on at a gallop, in order to tell his
                  leader to make haste, as two well-mounted strangers were cunning up at full
                  drive.</p>
               <p>"To hell's flames with them!" swore the bandit uncocking his Colt's and stuffing
                  it into its case; at the same time he flashed out his long knife, leaned over and,
                  dealing the wagoner a dreadful stab fairly tore him from the saddle.</p>
               <p>Felix jumped down and turned out Allan's pockets, in which he found the moderate
                  figure of four hundred dollars.</p>
               <p>Joaquin and his followers continued their way to meet the new comers. Before five
                  minutes had elapsed the latter came into view.</p>
               <p>"Now," said Joaquin, "we'll see what this haul will be. I won't stand any fooling
                  this time."</p>
               <p>A prick of the spur made his horse spring forward in advance of his little band.
                  The six holes of his revolver bearing on those approaching were sufficient without
                  the summons accompanying the movement, to prevail on them to draw rein. As the
                  horses reared, one of the riders laughed and said:</p>
               <p>"Why hullo, Joaquin, don't you know me? Is Bill Miller dead and under in you
                  mind?"</p>
               <p>"By heaven, so it is you," said the Sonorian with a smile; "I swear I didn't know
                  you at first. It's a slapping bit of horseflesh between your legs, Bill!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I'll bet you, yes. You see I've been picking out some good goers in
                  Sacramento Valley. I'm going down into that beautiful Sonora of yours on a spec in
                  horses. I'm dry as a mountain lake in summer and I've got to raise some 'dough'
                  afore long."</p>
               <p>"The deuce you say, Bill? You're a Yank, to be sure, but you've always shown
                  yourself to be a friend of mine. If a hundred will help you along any, ask and
                  here's the chink—its yours."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, my boy," said Bill, stowing away the sum, "it's as good a windfall as
                  if one of the Big Trees was blown down. Good luck till next time!"</p>
               <p>"Adios, amigo—good bye! luck to you as well," returned the captain of the
                  plunderers. "Don't mind a man and some horses just above on the road."</p>
               <p>"What then?"</p>
               <p>"The stupid fellow ran against a knife I had in my hand, that's all," added the
                  young leader.</p>
               <p>"Hum! that's settled," and off went Miller and his companion their way, while the
                  Mexicans went theirs.</p>
               <p>The murder of Allan Ruddell stirred up the embers again. To slay a man for four
                  hundred dollars was held to be "mighty mean."</p>
               <p>Now, one of the hot coals, that news fanned into flame, was Captain Harry Love, a
                  Pacific State Jack Hays, who got the idea into his head of organizing on his own
                  hook a little company to hunt the bold brigand.</p>
               <p>Since he had been able to reach a stirrup from the ground and to hold out a
                  pistol, Harry Love had been in the life of a ranger: his whole existence had
                  passed in braving fatigue and danger. He had rendered Uncle Sam great and many
                  services during the Mexican War, where he had been bearer of dispatched between
                  the military stations, through a country as wild and dangerous a could be
                  naturally, besides being bountifully supplied with guerrillas and independent
                  lancers. A coolness under fire that was unequalled, remarkable skill in handling
                  rifle, six-shooter and bowie, made him the man of all others to be fitted against
                  a desperado of Joaquin's calibre.</p>
               <p>After Ruddell's murder, Captain Harry Love set out on the assassin's trail and
                  pursued him to the Rancheria of San Luis de Gonzago, which served as the usual
                  haunt of the coyotes.</p>
               <p>He got there after night-fall and, informed by a spy whom he had posted there,
                  that the men he sought were surely in a tent at the other end of the rancheria, he
                  led his men cautiously in that direction.</p>
               <p>But, before they arrived at the door, a woman in the next canvas house espied them
                  and gave the alarm. Quicker than thought, Joaquin, Felix, and Gonzalez and Cardoza
                  made a slit in the back of the tent and slipped out and away under cover of the
                  darkness.</p>
               <p>When Harry Love and his companions made a dash in through the front opening, they
                  encountered—instead of a volley and a display of daggers—the feigned screams of
                  surprise of four or five females, three of whom were the mistresses of the chiefs
                  of the despoilers. The captain was not aware of this fact, or he might have made
                  hostages of them. He did not deem it well to press on the chase at this juncture
                  and let the thieves go quiet with the scare for this time.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, the escaped four had fled straight as the crow flies to a place eight
                  miles off, called Orris Timbers, where they took their revenge for being made fly
                  in stealing about thirty fine horses, which they drove off into the highlands near
                  at hand.</p>
               <p>On the following night, they returned to their light-o'-loves who donned their
                  masculine in all haste, and all turned again to the Sierra. They stayed there
                  until dawn, after which the party crossed Tular Prairie to Los Angelos, driving
                  before them the stolen cattle.</p>
               <p>On coming into the country of the Tejon Indians, they encamped on the brink<pb
                     n="22-23" xml:id="VAC8324-00000013"/> of a brooklet something less than five
                  miles from the chief village of that tribe.</p>
               <p>Everything seemed to promise that there was nothing to fear on the part of those
                  redskins, next to the Pah-Utahs most inoffensive of unromantic, dirty, greasy,
                  grubbing, ignoble children of the forest. So they stacked arms, so to say, and
                  resolved for several days to do no other hard work than rest and have their
                  fun.</p>
               <p>Now it chanced that one prowling savage, having snuffed roasting meat with his
                  capacious nostrils, crept up to the Mexican camping-ground, remarked their showy
                  raiment, their profusion of jewelry and the valuable horses that grazed around
                  them, and ran off to the capital city and into the royal palace (an old
                  gutta-percha blanket and a piece of sail-cloth stretched on poles) of the old
                  Sagamore Zappatara, to whom he glowingly depicted the wealth of the
                  pale-faces.</p>
               <p>One evening as Murieta, Gonzalez, and Felix, far from dreaming of danger, were
                  amusing themselves with their fair but frail companions, and as Cardoza, stretched
                  on the high grass, carelessly kept an eye on the cattle cropping choice tufts of
                  herbage here and there, they were all surrounded and overpowered by a formidable
                  crew of soiled aborigines, whose bonds not exactly of friendship but of
                  unbreakable rawhide, speedily encircled them.</p>
               <p>If a dagger had glittered, or a pistol had gone of by accident, or if even a good
                  fist-blow had drawn blood from one son of the woodlands' nose, ten to one the
                  whole party would have whisked round and shot back on the warpath with antelope's
                  speed.</p>
               <p>But, inasmuch as nothing of the kind occurred, they were delighted at the
                  unalloyed success of the enterprise, and leaves fell off the oaks at the deafening
                  yell of joy that went up from the throng, dancing, kicking up behind and before,
                  brandishing weapons unpleasantly under the captives' eyes, and almost kissing the
                  lucky brother who had found out the fish and spread the net which had entangled
                  them. Dragged to the headquarters of the valiant tribe, the prisoners were
                  stripped (with an expertness which they, though good judges, might envy) of
                  jewels, arms and clothing, being only permitted to preserve, as offerings of
                  respect to their modesty, several strips of cloth which were utterly useless to
                  the savages.</p>
               <p>The Mexicans had the satisfaction of seeing old Zappatara circulate among the
                  ravished squaws in three of their suits, one over the other. The other male garb
                  went to the spy.</p>
               <p>The Indians moreover had reaped and gleaned a harvest over and above the horses of
                  four thousand dollars in gold and half that amount in jewels. The lives of the
                  robbers were also in their hands.</p>
               <p>For a whole long week, the venerable chieftain kept them prisoners of war, while
                  he puzzled his elevated brain as to whether he should have them made living
                  targets, have them shot, burnt, hanged, drowned, made to run the gauntlet (for
                  which the voice of the women spoke, as their dear little boys hadn't had any sport
                  of late), or what not.</p>
               <p>At last, mercifully considering that they must be sufficiently punished for the
                  impudence of having entered his hunting-grounds, he came to another
                  conclusion.</p>
               <p>He called a council. And he had translated to the captives a long speech in which,
                  after declaring <unclear>himself almost</unclear> ready to wash out in their blood
                  the stain on his tribe put there by his having heard them curse them for "rascally
                  Injins," he spread himself in moral reflections on the enormity and number of the
                  crimes which they must have committed to have become possessed of such a great
                  quantity of gold and jewels.</p>
               <p>Then he had them "walked off Spanish" to the confines of his realm, escorted by a
                  detachment of his life-guard armed to the teeth with the knives and fire-arms late
                  the Mexicans, where they were glad to be let free.</p>

                  <p>MEETING WITH THE MOUNTAIN JIM.—HARRY LOVE TAKES GONZALEZ AND "BLOCKS THE GAME"
                     OF RESCUE.—MURDER OF CAPTAIN WILSON AND GENERAL BEAN.—JOE LAKE DOES HIS DUTY
                     AND IS WIPED OUT.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>JOAQUIN had borne his durance with the most perfect resignation. He could not help
                  laughing to himself at his ridiculous position and was astonished that the Tejons,
                  not exactly accounted as copper-faced Chevalier Bayards, should have ever had
                  pluck enough to see out an exploit so risky.</p>
               <p>After two days' journey, the little company gained the entrance of Tejon Pass,
                  situated a few miles from the San Francisco Ranche. They had the fortune there to
                  meet one of their supporters, Mountain Jim, who—on having heard the story of their
                  adventure—went back to the settlement, from which he brought the vestments of
                  which they stood in need, and besides furnished them with three horses.</p>
               <p>One of them, a splendid animal, black without one white hair, elegantly bridled
                  and saddled, was made a present to the chief with a Colt's revolver and a knife.
                  Thus was Joaquin, late a defenceless fugitive, quickly turned into the redoubtable
                  King of Cutthroats, well clad, booted, and armed, by means of the branch resources
                  of the association formed and directed by his genius for plunder.</p>
               <p>All being well once more, Joaquin, Felix and Gonzalez mounted, took up their
                  love-lasses on the crupper and went off at full speed in the direction of San
                  Gabriel. Cardoza followed them on foot.</p>
               <p>They did not reach that place until far into the night. On entering their place of
                  meeting, an out-of-the-way house, they unexpectedly found Guerra and Valenzuela
                  with their commands.</p>
               <p>Returned to Sonora sooner than had been calculated, and not finding their outlaw
                  general at Arroyo Cantuva, they had preferred to try a new expedition of ravaging
                  rather than rust in idleness.</p>
               <p>They had committed numerous depredations since their return in the neighborhood of
                  San Gabriel, but they had brought the attention of General Bean upon them and he
                  had so hotly chased them that they had only escaped two or three brushes by
                  superior running.</p>
               <p>"That man must die!" said Joaquin. "He has become too dangerous to us, and we will
                  have to rub him out before we pull up stakes hereabouts."</p>
               <p>"Death, death to the general!" was the unanimous cry.</p>
               <p>The conversation turned next on the trip to Sonora.</p>
               <p>The marauders told their commander that the stock run off had been placed safely
                  on the farm which he had designated.</p>
               <p>The gang was abundantly supplied with food, clothes, liquors and cigars, so they
                  made up their minds to spend two or three weeks in this "location."</p>
               <p>In the meantime, Gonzalez and Cardoza were sent on a private mission to the Santa
                  Buenaventura Ranche, which was where the Californian highway chief took refuge in
                  imminent danger.</p>
               <p>Several days afterwards, Captain Harry Love, deputy sheriff then of Los Angelos
                  County, who knew Gonzalez by sight, perceived him with Cardoza near Buenaventura,
                  and instantly set to work to secure and him give over to justice.</p>
               <p>After having patiently watched them he saw them go into a little grocery or
                  doggery, situated on a cross-path through the mountains. The captain took up his
                  position behind a rock, and kept a steady look-out.</p>
               <p>Twenty minutes or so elapsed when Harry, beginning to find the bandits stay rather
                  long, left his hiding-place and proceeded toward the shanty. At<pb n="24-25"
                     xml:id="VAC8324-00000014"/> the moment of his stepping up to it, Cardoza came
                  out, but alone, and took the mountain road.</p>
               <p>Love sprang upon him, but the brigand gave him the slip and took to his heels at a
                  fast pace.</p>
               <p>A couple of balls whistled after him, one of which furrowed his skull, while, the
                  other sent flying into splinters the angle of a boulder which the fugitive leaped
                  around and behind which he vanished.</p>
               <p>The captain, who did not greatly hold the capture of Cardoza to heart, turned all
                  his attention thereupon on Gonzalez, whom he knew to be a desperate scoundrel,
                  whereas he could only suspect the fled one on the "birds of a feather flock
                  together" principle. On rushing into the cabin, pistol in hand expecting to have a
                  fierce and bloody tussle, he was astonished to see the thief drunk on the
                  trodden-earth floor.</p>
               <p>Half an hour after, by which time he had brought the drunkard around by shaking
                  him and dousing him with water, the two were jogging along over the road to the
                  chief town of the county.</p>
               <p>Cardoza saw them from the distance and he lost no time to inform his superior of
                  it.</p>
               <p>The latter, followed by Mountain Jim and by the whole of Valenzuela's gang flew in
                  all haste with the intention of surrounding the captor and delivering their
                  entrapped brother. They travelled all night and, at dawn, came at length upon the
                  two.</p>
               <p>Gonzalez heard their signal, and responded to it by turning in the saddle and
                  waving his scarf.</p>
               <p>Harry, on his side, felt what was the jeopardy in which he was placed riding alone
                  with so dangerous a companion, and, on seeing the latter's appeal which treachery
                  broke all the tacit faith between them, he put a bullet in Gonzalez's heart.</p>
               <p>A glance behind showed him a whirling column of dust in which rode a troop of
                  horses as swift as the wind. He gave his steed the spur and rode on at that
                  tearing, break-neck gait which the rangers know how to make a nag take.</p>
               <p>A few minutes afterwards, the would-be rescuers pulled up at the spot where the
                  prisoner had fallen; finding him free by death, they yelled with rage and
                  disappointment.</p>
               <p>They could not do anything, for—with the start the captain had—the best of Morgan
                  or Eclipse blood could scarcely have overtaken him before he rattled into town
                  with the news of having cleared the roads of one red-handed rover.</p>
               <p>On the baffled robbers returning to San Gabriel, Joaquin learned that Three
                  fingered Jack and his division were at Los Angelos and that Captain Wilson, deputy
                  sheriff of Santa Barbara County, had visited San Gabriel the night before, with
                  the design of seeking the head of the highwayman, whom he had sworn to take dead
                  or alive. In eagerness to see Jack, Joaquin took two of his boldest rogues with
                  him and went down to Los Angelos, where he found his lieutenant.</p>
               <p>The latter reported that he had burnt, ten miles out of San Gabriel, a house of
                  which all the people had been massacred one after another as they tried in agony
                  to flee through the flames.</p>
               <p>The chief remained several days there in his old asylum.</p>
               <p>One evening as he went the rounds to gather the news, he heard that Captain Wilson
                  had put up at the hotel, speaking openly of the resolve he had made to put an end
                  shortly to the criminal career of the young terror of the placers.</p>
               <p>The next evening a couple of native miners got into a row in front of that hotel,
                  and a crowd speedily collected to witness the fight.</p>
               <p>Like others, Captain Wilson ran down into the street in order to look at the
                  struggle.</p>
               <p>A horseman was beside him at the outskirts of the ring, who bent down to say in
                  his ear:</p>
               <p>"I am Joaquin!"</p>
               <p>Wilson startled, instinctively caught at the horse's reins, but they had been
                  already jerked away, and as he lifted his head a bullet penetrated it, and he fell
                  under the feet of the bystanders, breathing his last.</p>
               <p>With a loud re-itterance of his outcry, the Sonorian spurred from the spot.</p>
               <p>The quarrel between the Californians had been a trick invented by Jack of the
                  Three Fingers merely to draw Wilson out of the hotel and give his commander an
                  opening for the assassination.</p>
               <p>After a short conference with his lieutenants, the leader sent Valenzuela and his
                  men, including Mountain Jim and Cardoza, into San Diego County.</p>
               <p>Their orders were to run off all the live-stock (equine) that they could come
                  across and take them to the depot at Arroyo Cantuva.</p>
               <p>In the meanwhile, he retraced his steps to San Gabriel with Jack and some
                  others.</p>
               <p>At the end of a week or so, Luis Guerra, who had been set to spy the movements of
                  General Bean, saw the latter one evening leaving his dwelling in the town to ride
                  to a piece of property which he owned some miles distant.</p>
               <p>Joaquin, the spy, and Three-fingered Jack started personally on the mission and
                  ambushed themselves on the highway about a mile from the general's
                  destination.</p>
               <p>When he came abreast of the waylayers, they leaped out altogether on him, and
                  despite a vigorous and gallant defense, the bandits rendered useless the weapons
                  which Bean carried.</p>
               <p>Guerra and Jack pulled him out of his saddle, and their master twice buried his
                  knife in the brave heart and stretched the man at his feet; the three-fingered
                  miscreant, to satisfy his brutal instincts, concluded his share in the atrocity by
                  clapping his six-shooter to the corpse's head and emptying half the barrels in the
                  fractured skull.</p>
               <p>This awful execution finished, the actors fled to their fellows, with whom they
                  went northerly into Calaveras County, "blazing" their path by a long series of
                  robberies.</p>
               <p>The month of August was dying out in '52, when the Scourge of the Golden State set
                  foot in the town of Jackson.</p>
               <p>One evening, as he was strolling about unattended, he encountered a young man of
                  the name of Joseph lake, who had been known by him before he had taken to the
                  road.</p>
               <p>They had worked "share and share" in the mines on the Stanislaus, and had been
                  intimate during some time.</p>
               <p>After a friendly greeting, the outlaw turned bridle and for several minutes, rode
                  on silently by the others side, boot to boot. At last, gently tapping Lake on the
                  shoulder, he said in a voice a little affected by emotion:</p>
               <p>"Joe, there's no use talking. You know what I was, and what I am now-a-days; but,
                  I swear to you before heaven, injustice and tryanny drove me to it!"</p>
               <p>So say all such men. He who avenges a wrong on the committer of it, may be
                  pardoned by his fellow man, but there can be no excuse to the person who wars
                  against society, and deals his blows alike at old and young, innocent and
                  guilty.</p>
               <p>"I don't ask you to like me and to esteem me now," continued Joaquin, "for you are
                  an honest fellow, but I beg one favor of you, don't betray me to those who do not
                  know my real name and character here."</p>
               <p>"Joaquin," answered the other, "it's true that we were hand in hand together in
                  the old days, we were thick as brothers. So we would be still, if you had kept in
                  the honest man's path; but the papers are cancelled to-day and there's too wide a
                  gulch between us."</p>
               <p>"You're right there, Joe," said the Sonorian; "but for all that you won't betray
                  me. Though the Americans are my deadly enemies, I love you for the sake of the
                  past, and I'll be d—— sorry to harm you, but I will have to kill you, rest
                  assured, if you speak one word of this meeting of ours."</p>
               <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC8324-00000015"/>
               <p>"Never fear," replied Lake. "No danger of that. But you need not be to free of
                  threats."</p>
               <p>Thus they parted.</p>
               <p>The chief of the cutthroats took a roundabout way to reach his retreat, while his
                  former friend went on the road which led him to the little hamlet of Ornitas where
                  he lived.</p>
               <p>Lake thought over the whole during the night, and came to the conclusion that it
                  was his duty to waken his countrymen to the fact of the dreaded banditti, no doubt
                  being in seclusion so near, and he told of his meeting with Murieta.</p>
               <p>Only a few feet from Lake, as he was acquainting his friends with this, was half
                  reclining a Mexican wrapped up in his blanket who seemed to be equally wrapped up
                  in the puffing of his cigarettes, one of which he offered to the Amercan with that
                  charming gracefulness, inborn in the Mexicans, the Spanish and Italians.</p>
               <p>About three hours afterwards, a man, whose horse was standing a little way from
                  him, walked up slowly to a party chatting in front of a shop, of which one was Joe
                  Lake.</p>
               <p>"Friend, come here a moment, if you please," was the politely-entoned desire
                  coming from the heavy black beard of the stranger.</p>
               <p>"Joe, you're wanted," said his friends, pushing him towards the caller.</p>
               <p>"Do you know me, Joe?" asked the latter.</p>
               <p>"Why, I know you voice, I think, but——"</p>
               <p>The false beard fell off the face.</p>
               <p>"Ha! you are——"</p>
               <p>"Joaquin! you've betrayed me, sir!"</p>
               <p>With the words a bullet flew at Lake, and he dropped dead with a shattered
                  skull.</p>
               <p>Thanks to the celerity of himself and of his horse, the murderer ran unscathed the
                  gauntlet of shots.</p>
               <p>In a few minutes he was descried on top of a hill in the distance, leading away
                  some forty or fifty mounted men.</p>
               <p>"The robbers, the robbers!" was the cry of all, to which a shout, made faint by
                  the space between, fiercely if low responded.</p>

                  <p>IN CAMP.—A GUERRILLA'S STORY.—THE SLAUGHTER OF CELESTIALS.—THE OLD HAUNT AND
                     NEW RECRUITS.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE king coyote, uneasy about his acolytes, Valenzuela, Cardoza, and Mountain Jim,
                  and about the results of their doings, directed his steps towards the general
                  rendezvous.</p>
               <p>On the following day, they encamped on the high edge of a gully, where, after
                  having kindled a rousing fire, they all commenced an onslaught on sardines and
                  crackers, of which handy comestibles the depredator usually had good store.</p>
               <p>In the middle of the meal, Jack of the Three Fingers directed the attention of his
                  comrades towards a little spark of fire which seemed to be a fixed point in the
                  cup of the ravine.</p>
               <p>"Holy Mother!" exclaimed the Mexicans. "Who and what can that be?"</p>
               <p>"It is in all likelihood the camp-fire of some of the redskins," said Joaquin,
                  letting his eyes listlessly wander towards the indicated site. As you found it out
                  first, Jack," said he with a smile to the man of the mutilated hand, suppose you
                  do us the pleasure of scouting a bit thereaway and seeing if a little dust or a
                  nugget or two is not to be had for the asking."</p>
               <p>"That's me, Cap.," replied the other.</p>
               <p>He jumped up on his feet and, after giving his large mouth a dry wipe with his not
                  over clean jacket sleeve added:</p>
               <p>"You'll always find this chap ready for that sort of biz."</p>
               <p>"Good! but finish your supper," said the robber chief.</p>
               <p>"Oh, no I'll set sail d'rectly. There's no fear of the sardines growing cold, ha,
                  ha!"</p>
               <p>Sticking his revolver and knife into his belt the speaker walked into the brush
                  with the easy step of a man who would not in the least mind whatever might jump up
                  out of the shadows so thick in the underwood.</p>
               <p>"Jack's a brave lad," remarked Felix, "he goes into a muss as freely as into a
                  fandango. But he's unluckily an awful lover of bloodshed."</p>
               <p>"Oh, there's worse than he," interrupted Guerra, "he ain't half what was old Padre
                  Jurata, whom many of us had for chief in Mexico."</p>
               <p>"No, no, certainly not!" chorussed half a dozen.</p>
               <p>"He was a regular devil!" went on Guerra. "A downright monster. You remember the
                  way he cleared out the Aparelhos, boys?"</p>
               <p>Some did, and some did not remember the said "clearing out," and those who were on
                  the ignoramus side pressed Guerra to tell the story. So applying to a bottle first
                  to wash down the dry cracker crumbs, the old Mexican freelance began this story,
                  which is only too true.</p>
               <p>"Well, you must know that an American sailor long before the war with the
                  confounded heritics of North Americans, cast anchor from cruising in Guaymas. He
                  married a Sonorian girl and very soon afterwards removed up north near the border,
                  up our way. His boys grew up not twenty miles from our house, and we often went
                  hunting together. The old chap was a skinny but very tall fellow, all bones and
                  muscle, which had given him his name, for his real one was unpronounceable to us,
                  these <emph>Smeets</emph> and <emph>Bruns</emph> and <emph>Gohanes</emph> are
                  dreadful barbarious, say, ain't they, compared to our musical ones."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, yes!" rose all the voices unanimously.</p>
               <p>"Well, Aparelhos, as his boys grew up, two he had I ought to have said as well as
                  a daughter, began to have a reputation for wealth growing up as well. He had huge
                  luck, and he used to work right up to the first heavy fall in the rainy season and
                  begin again the moment the ground was the least dried. These Americans are
                  shockingly industrious, say, mates all?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, there's no name for it!" said the bandits groaning at the dreadful de pravity
                  of men who wouldn't be idle.</p>
               <p>"He used to find gold, sometimes silver, choice pieces of fragrant wood that
                  brought thundering prices at the port and was h—on hitting the animals that had
                  the finest skins. So it went on all well with him, his farm extended, for he
                  bought Ignacio Rosales, Martin Morelos, Fabrino Cartelho out and out, cattle,
                  haciendo and ground. But the war broke out when those gringos said Texas was
                  theirs and not ours and did get it, too. Galveston's five times the size it was a
                  few years ago—just think of the devil's children being so busy!"</p>
               <p>All the hands were lifted in pious horror and all the voices groaned a deep
                  "Oh!"</p>
               <p>"Just about this time," went on Guerra, "Padre Jurata began to preach and, a lot
                  of us coming together—you, and you, and you, know, eh?"</p>
               <p>Half a dozen nodded.</p>
               <p>"We formed a neat little guerrilla band and had a lively time skurrying about to
                  pick up such Yankees as were caught in the province, confiscating their goods for
                  the cause. Aparelhos had lived among us so long that none of us recollected that
                  he was one of the heritics. Well, one summer's night—oh, how<pb n="28-29"
                     xml:id="VAC8324-00000016"/> well I remember the scene, the horses around, the
                  reverend father tight as a brick, his lieutenant Fra Christino most as far gone,
                  Ramon Ninonentz and me playing cards—Lord! I remember going to play 'a seven of
                  swords,' to his 'nine of lozenges'! Poor fellow, he was thrown out of one of those
                  big two story houses in Sansome street by a Goliah of a yankee who caught him in
                  the room of his girl—girls were scarce in those days—and poor Ramon was stunned
                  and smothered in a mud-puddle. Well, he and me were playing as our sentinels
                  brought a young fellow into camp, his hands tied behind him.</p>
               <p>"'Here's 'Mingo Aparelhos,' said our men; "caught hanging round camp, coyote
                  fashion."</p>
               <p>"'You lie,' says he, 'I was coming to see the reverend father.'</p>
               <p>"With that Brother Christino jumped up and says he: 'Padre Jurata is in a
                  religious ecstasy. What do you want?'</p>
               <p>"Now Domingo was a half breed who was the castaway from everybody in the
                  village—heaven knows who his father was, the mother was a poor wretch of a loose
                  Indian-Sonorian who took to the woods when he was born. Evil tongues said Sailor
                  Aparelhos had something to do with the parentage—I don't believe it myself, and I
                  won't speak ill of the dead and gone to purgatory. Partly from that and more
                  because he had taken pity on the boy and housed him. The mongrel was half-cracked
                  anyhow.</p>
               <p>"While we were questioning him, old Jurata woke up.</p>
               <p>"'What's the row?' 'A prisoner,' answered Christino. 'Oh, hang him!' 'But he's got
                  something to tell us.' 'Give him a drink and loosen his tongue.' 'But he's a
                  half-breed son of a heretic and we don't want to foul our bottles with his satanic
                  lips,' said the fra who was death on the enemies of the faith. 'Brother. Half hang
                  him, cut him down, and kick him into a thorn bush, and don't keep the mazcal
                     <emph>all</emph> to yourself while you're doing it.' 'But he talks of money,'
                  continued Fra Christino in a loud whisper.</p>
               <p>"Jurata jumped up, and only staggered a little. 'Mother Church, in her holy son
                  here representing, is always ready to receive,' he began, forgetting he was on the
                  war-path. But a shake from his lieutenant set him to rights.</p>
               <p>"'Well, what brought you here to the camp of the Loyal Lancers and Government
                  Guerrillas of the Province of Sonora,' challenged our commands to scare him.</p>
               <p>"'I want to be enrolled in your band,' answered Mingo.</p>
               <p>"'The dev—I mean, the <emph>dev</emph>-out vow I have to keep my ranks pure won't
                  allow that, my son. You're the son of a heretic—the offspring of the devil——"</p>
               <p>"'No more devil than you,' cried Domingo, who was very easily set fire. "I'm in
                  love with Donna Manyolina and I told her so this morning. She took me by the
                  throat and locked me up in her room, which I entered, till her brothers and the
                  old man came home. The old wretch whipped me like a dog and the cursed sons,
                  laughing at me all the while, dragged me to the horsepond and chucked me in.'</p>
               <p>"'You do look damp,' said Juruta, and we all laughed.</p>
               <p>"'I've sworn to be avenged,' went on 'Mingo, 'I'll kill all the Aparelhos, burn
                  their houses, cut their cattle's throats, pull down the hacienda walls——'</p>
               <p>"'Go on; I don't see that it's our business,' said Jurata, and we burst into
                  laughter again, the mongrel looked so comic yelling out and tossing his arms,
                  which we had unloosed, about.</p>
               <p>"But Aparelhos is an American in heart—so are they all,' screamed Domin go in
                  fury—they are joyous when they hear of the victories of the United States—they
                  were mad and sad when they heard of the Alamo.'</p>
               <p>"'Ha, ha!' said Fra Christino, 'we must look into this nest of serpents——</p>
               <p>"'Silence!' roared Jurata like a bull; 'Aparelhos can't help that. He only talks,
                  not does. He gave a thousand dollars and two silver candlesticks which he got at
                  Guaymas to our chapel, and he gave me that very horse there, for he said 'twas a
                  shame for a weak priest like me to have to foot it—and it was a shame on the
                  Catholic farmers with their herds of asses, mules and mustangs! And he's always
                  hospitable, and fetches out first-class wines to his guests, if they are unworthy
                  sons of the true faith like humble Padre Jurata!' says our old leader, smacking
                  his lips.</p>
               <p>"'But I know the secret hiding-place of lots of gold and silver coin—the old man's
                  got ever so much!' howled Domingo, wild at all his entreaties being wasted.</p>
               <p>"We all looked at one another," said Guerra, "and then at our reverend Captain.
                  That last thing settled it.</p>
               <p>"'Ahem!' coughed Jurata. 'Well, my good Domingo, out with it. On second thoughts,
                  no traitor to the Republic must be let escape unpunished under mistaken ideas of
                  mercy, no! He is amassing money to aid some grand plot for helping the foe, who
                  can doubt?</p>
               <p>"Of course,' cried we all. 'Death to the traitor!"</p>
               <p>"'Give me a horse and anything—a knife even and let me join you,' said
                  Domingo.</p>
               <p>"You? no impure bloods are going to sully our cause!' answered the padre.</p>
               <p>"'You refuse, eh?' yelled Domingo. 'May the Holy Mother curse you! May her son
                  send lightning on you! may all the saints——"</p>
               <p>"Down came Padre Jurata's machete on his skull, which it split, and he never moved
                  again. Christino had nearly got his arm taken off in trying to bar the blow.</p>
               <p>"Curse him!' he couldn't help swearing, he's carried the secret of the cache with
                  him."</p>
               <p>"So he had. But we, thinking that no one better than we could hunt up gold and
                  valuables, sprang to horse and rattied off to St. Mary of Leon's Butte, on which
                  Aparelhos' house was built. We reached it in half an hour, pretty well scratched
                  from going through the chapparel at such a pace. When we hammered at the big gate,
                  one of the young men came out.</p>
               <p>"(The peons, I ought to tell you, were away from the house in their dwelling, and
                  they left for the thicket, when we began to work).</p>
               <p>"'Who's there?' challenged the son. We told him, when he said we might be d——d,
                  and back he went into the house. They had been reconnoitering from the upper
                  windows, we could see. We surrounded the place, heaping up the brush and lots of
                  torchwood at the gates, which we burnt through. There was a black and a couple of
                  servants in the house who fought for their master, especially after old Aparelhos
                  had blown the brains out of one of them who had tried to jump out of the window.
                  Afraid of fighting at anything but close quarters, for the three Americans, as I
                  call them, were blasted fine shots, we charged in two parties, front and rear. I
                  was in the latter division, which Jurata led. We smashed in a window by exploding
                  a horn of powder at it.</p>
               <p>"The first of us who jumped through was cut into four neat quarters by the old
                  rascal's cavalry sword. He nearly stuck the old reverend next, but I pushed
                  Dormeli Punez at him and he ran him through by mistake. We had a lively flurry in
                  the dark, but no more of us were killed. We had to tumble back out of the
                  window.</p>
               <p>"On the other hand, Christino had better luck. He had been beaten back but he
                  brought out with him one of the sons prisoner, and had killed the three men
                  servants as well as the wife. We tried a rush once more, no go. We waited for an
                  hour or two, till we had a lot of wood collected and made a monstrous fire in
                  front, leaving a few to keep a look out there. So under the couple of windows each
                  side. When the flames began to rise and drive the two men, left to our side, we
                  made our third attempt and dragged out them both. The son was dead, the father
                  only stunned with a head wound.</p>
               <p>"Then we began to cry out that we wouldn't hurt anybody who surrendered. Out came
                  the cameresta, a luscious slip of a girl—delicious! Donna Mayolina<pb n="30-31"
                     xml:id="VAC8324-00000017"/> appeared at the broken window in the light, for
                  half the front of the building was burning merrily now. We called her to come, but
                  her father who had come to life and recovered his voice, spoilt all by
                  shouting:</p>
               <p>"'No, no! they lie! Join, join your dead mother, murdered by them!'</p>
               <p>"We were going to strike him dead for this, but Jurata wouldn't allow it; one of
                  us did tap him with the flat of his sword, and he swooned again. His son looked on
                  with set teeth and eyes like coals.</p>
               <p>"The burning house looked like a skeleton one, with the blaze at the front, and
                  illumined the sky, but none of the far off neighbors cared to come. Well for 'em.
                  The heat made us fall back. Suddenly the girl appeared on the upper roof, up which
                  she had to run his up a hill, for it had fallen in at the other end some few feet.
                  God! wasn't she pretty, handsome, splendid, standing up in that red and yellow
                  brightened air!</p>
               <p>"'I remember! and I, and I!' said one or two. 'Guerra's telling it just as it
                  was!'</p>
               <p>"Her hair flying loose in wild disorder, her robe torn and dishevelled, showed her
                  beautiful figure, almost like a marble statue. Such a lovely form as that girl
                  possessed we had never before gazed on.</p>
               <p>"Seen too in that brilliant, dazzling light, she looked more like some angel
                  alighting from the skies than a more mortal girl. I never saw the like."</p>
               <p>The excitable and excited auditors listened, holding their breath and fastening
                  their flashing eyes on Guerra.</p>
               <p>"There she stood like a new kind of statue. We could not stir for a moment, when
                  the same idea of saving her impelled half a dozen of us to run into the heated air
                  and hold out a horse blanket. And we shouted above the hissing, crackling, roaring
                  of the accursed flames——</p>
               <p>"'Jump down, senorita, for the love of God!' interrupted several, those who had
                  been witnesses with Guerra of the scene which he narrated. 'Yes, yes.'</p>
               <p>"Yes, those were the words," said Guerra. "She hesitated. The tongues of fire
                  darted up behind her higher and thicker than ever. We shouted again. She turned
                  coolly round, and we thought we saw her bright eyes fill with tears which ran down
                  her doubly scorching cheeks, as she looked her last on our prisoners. Her last,
                  for the next moment she sprang into the very core of all that immense bowl of
                  devil's punch. We thought that the fire danced more merrily than before, anyhow
                  that's where she ended her life and destroyed all her beauteous form."</p>
               <p>The enthusiastic hearers murmured in Spanish words of pity, such as: "Poor
                  girl—poor maiden. May Our Lady have her!" for they forgot the attending
                  circumstances to place all their interest on the central figure. There was a
                  pause, no one breaking the spell by either eating or drinking. Finally, one spoke
                  up:</p>
               <p>"The rest, Guerra. What more?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, yes. Well, the brother of the girl, who had been watching her in horror, fell
                  down and we could not awaken him any more than we, could his father. They were not
                  dead however. Jurata, who had not forgotten the treasure of which Domingo had said
                  so much, turned sharply on the camerista, and asked her where her master kept his
                  money hidden. She did not know, or would not tell, whichever it was. Jurata gave
                  orders, and off ran Juan Moliti to the stables, from which he brought back a
                  horse's nose-bag."</p>
               <p>"'You won't tell? very well,' said the padre. 'Go ahead Juan.'</p>
               <p>"Juan collected a couple of handfuls in quantity of the half burnt cinders that
                  were rained down near us, and put them in the bag, which had a bottom too thick to
                  be easily burnt through. Then he tied the bag over the mouth of the girl, after
                  Jurata had asked her again, saying he was sorry to spoil a pretty bird's singing.
                  The girl could draw a little fresh air through her nose, but her mouth took in the
                  scorching smoke from the bag, of course.</p>
               <p>"She began to twist and fight so that four of us could hardly hold her. Her poor
                  little bosom gave a couple of heaves and she worked her limbs so furiously that we
                  let go. She stood reeling for a moment, threw up her arms—the bag falling off—and
                  gave a dreadful cough. Blood poured out of her mouth, and she sank as if a
                  mesquite had fallen upon her.</p>
               <p>'Curses she's dead without having spoken!' raged the reverend chief.</p>
               <p>"'Good!' broke in old Aparelhos, who had come to.</p>
               <p>"Who said that?" bellowed Jurata, turning. 'Ah, ha! you've found your tongue
                  again. I've been thinking how to make you speak. Will you tell us where you keep
                  your treasure?</p>
               <p>"'My treas——'</p>
               <p>"'Yes, Domingo has let us into the secret of it—at least of the being one. Come,
                  out with it.'</p>
               <p>"'Give one dollar to you, you—you!' and I don't know what he did not call us. 'Do
                  your worst, you shan't learn.'</p>
               <p>"Jurata whispered to somebody, Moretos the younger, I believe, but that does not
                  matter," said Guerra, "and he tore the scarf of the dead cameresta into strips,
                  which he wound around every finger of the American's right hand just as if you
                  were going to bind up a broken arm. And he was most securely pinioned.</p>
               <p>"'Will you tell?'</p>
               <p>"'I'll see you all in the hell's flames sure to be your portion first;' cried old
                  Aparelhos doggedly.</p>
               <p>"Old Father Jurata took the bottle of oil from Moretos, who was our surgeon for
                  the horses and who had been to his saddlebags for it, and poured it on the bound
                  up hand, the cloth on which soaked it up like a cayman in heat drinking a brooklet
                  dry. Then a branch of torchwood was lighted and brought and the hand was set
                  afire! The old heretic stood it for it for a couple to minutes, but then began to
                  howl. But he kept shouting out:</p>
               <p>"'That's from the agony, God d—— you, but (gritting his teeth) I won't speak.'</p>
               <p>"As his hand burnt up like a big church candle before the shrine of Our Lady the
                  Queen of the Angels, the old American yelled and bowled, he cursed us in English,
                  Indian and Spanish, till his son was roused by the noise, and, finding he could
                  not get loose, for he was wound round with a reata, and rawhide may give but it
                  won't break, he called out:</p>
               <p>"'Father, dear father! Oh, let the old man go and roast me instead.'</p>
               <p>"'Will you tell where the riches are?' asked the Padre.</p>
               <p>"He looked at his father.</p>
               <p>"'No,' says the old American, 'they'll have their devil's sport anyhow.'</p>
               <p>"'See you skinned first,' answered the young fellow.</p>
               <p>"'Give him a handsome glove,' says Jurata laughing, 'they're so much alike we had
                  better mate them.'</p>
               <p>"So the two hands blazed together. I've been hard upon the sands and have had to
                  chew dead mulesteak a little touched and smelling," said Guerra, "but I was sick
                  like the rest, at the damnable stench of that burning flesh. They twisted and
                  groaned, but we could not get one word out of them. We flourished knives and
                  machettes under their eyes and jammed escopette muzzles against their teeth but no
                  use. At last Jurata had them run up to the boughs of a tree, and we with empty
                  hands had to turn our backs on the ruins of the house. Oh, the good old times,"
                  ending the ex-guerrilla, sighing. "I don't feel well to think it's all over."</p>
               <p>"May be our countrymen will give the Yankees a strong taste of the same in this
                  state yet," observed some one.</p>
               <p>"Maybe. But here's Jack. And not alone."</p>
               <p>The three-fingered freebooter indeed made his appearance, driving before him<pb
                     n="32-33" xml:id="VAC8324-00000018"/> eight Chinese, complete in pig-tail,
                  frock, loose breeches and cheap boots. They had been trembling violently enough
                  already, but when they saw themselves in the presence of a large body of armed
                  men, they tumbled down on their knees and begged for mercy in the worst of mixed
                  Spanish and English, but which was extremely expressive from their pitiable tone.
                  Their earnest entreaties, now in full rolling of the almond eyes, and active
                  gestures, only excited the hilarity of the whole band, who made the place ring
                  with unrestrained bursts of merriment.</p>
               <p>Jack ordered the Orientals, by means of blended threats and pantomime to change
                  their position from standing, to setting on the rocks a few feet from the fire.
                  This command was executed with prompt obedience, after which Jack flourished his
                  knife over the heads of the line by way of intimation that if they moved an
                  eyebrow or the tips of their queues, he would cut their heads off. He resumed,
                  with as good an appetite as anybody could boast, his meal on the crackers and
                  sardines.</p>
               <p>"Mi amigo Jack, my friend," inquired Joaquin, "whence that blood, still fresh I
                  should say, that I see on your dagger's blade?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, that spatter there." Why, I had to stick one of these funny Johns to explain
                  my meaning to the rest. As soon as they saw that one of their blessed crowd kissed
                  the ground and stayed there, one of them, turning as reasonable as could be, took
                  the head of the file and the rest trotted along after him like Santa Fe sheep.
                  That's how I made out to fetch them so far."</p>
               <p>"Well, now that you've got them, what good are they going to be to anybody?"</p>
               <p>"Why, they're too much like sheep not to be bled, the same way."</p>
               <p>"You'd better hurry up your cakes, then," said Felix. "They're half way to Mono
                  lake (the dead sea of California) already."</p>
               <p>"Oh, they can wait," returned the semi-cannibal, darting on the captives so
                  significant a look that they began mumbling something to Joss. "I brought them
                  here to amuse the company, but I'm going to fill the barrel of my body with a
                  charge of soda crackers and a wad of sardines before I open the show. I think the
                  Yankees are right in one idea of theirs: 'Business before pleasure.'"</p>
               <p>A quarter of an hour elapsed in the consumption of the eatables by the speaker and
                  of tobacco with the others. Then the former sprang up and to the poor Chinese,
                  seven of whom he drew together by their tails and made a new sort of a wheel of
                  them by tying them all together. He grabbed the separate victim by the long braid
                  as well and hauled him backwards and nearly stumbling up to the fire. The bandits
                  jumped up.</p>
               <p>"Stop, stop, Jack!" shouted several. "You ain't going to make cracknels of them,
                  blast you? Guerra's been story telling enough of that without our wanting the
                  real. "Don't! a fellow can't keep his supper down with a frying Chinese to look
                  at."</p>
               <p>"No, no, I only lugged him here to let the light fall on him."</p>
               <p>Out came Jack's knife then, to be plunged up to the buckhorn haft in the heart of
                  the luckless devil. The dying man wrestled with his murderers for a second, when
                  the latter flung him off. The body fell beside the fire, and a thick stream of
                  blood, by the shock, gushed out of the horrible gash and put out the flames.</p>
               <p>"Carajo!" swore one Mexican, "you've spotted my jacket!"</p>
               <p>"Caramba! maldita! the fire's a goner."</p>
               <p>Joaquin stepped up.</p>
               <p>"Enough of that, Jack! I won't stand any such wantonness. Kill 'em all at once
                  where they are, and make no bones about it."</p>
               <p>"Oh, all right, captain, just as you say, I thought the boys wanted some sport,
                  but I'll have all the fun to myself now."</p>
               <p>So saying, he dragged the corpse to one side, let it drop and went over to the
                  shuddering remainder.</p>
               <p>Without being in the least moved by their yells, screams, prayers, weeping he
                  stabbed some and cut the throats of others most leisurely.</p>
               <p>Before the first one had been butchered, the three women had pulled their
                  blanket-shawls over their heads so as not to behold the horrible affair.</p>
               <p>They might have applauded the bull who gored a toreador in a fight, the man who
                  brought down his opponent at sword's points or short pistol-range, but they hated
                  and were disgusted to be tacit accomplices in the slaughter of the unfortunate
                  descendants of the builders of the Great Wall which they were wrong to have
                  passed.</p>
               <p>Clarina, who was seated by her lover, overheard him give the order for the
                  despatching of one prisioners; moved by a deep feeling of compassion, she wished
                  to try to shield from cruelty those who yet survived.</p>
               <p>Without uncovering her face, she let fall her head on the robber's shoulder, and
                  said in a tremulous voice:</p>
               <p>"Oh, Joaquin, why won't you prevent that awful massacre, so useless, of harmless
                  men? Hear their despairing cries! You can—won't you hold back the wretch's
                  hand?"</p>
               <p>"My dearly loved girl, that's what I cannot do. Garcia is cruel and violent, and
                  he only haked his fortune to mine to satisfy his dreadful thirst for blood; but he
                  is brave and does not know what danger is, so that it would be a great loss for me
                  to have to part with him."</p>
               <p>"Are they beyond hope, poor things, then?" murmured Clarina.</p>
               <p>"Yes. I'm sorry in the bottom of my heart for it. Hark! There are only two voices
                  to be heart now—only one—it dies away with its owner. There, the whole work of
                  blood is ended. They suffer no longer, poor fools for ever having crossed the
                  Pacific."</p>
               <p>"By all the saints," ejaculated the bloody-handed murderer, falling on a bunch of
                  grass and his blanket by the rekindled, fire, "if this isn't a red-letter night on
                  my books, shoot me! Those funny dogs resisted just enough to put an edge to it.
                  One fellow scratched me and kicked beautiful!" Oh, San Miguel, Santa Antonina, let
                  me have another such a treat and I'll walk to Cuba and be joyfully garotted!"</p>
               <p>At day break, the party set out again. Notwithstanding the tragedy of the
                  proceeding night, all were heart free and gay enough in looking forward to a long
                  quiet stay a their principal retreat. The females especially felt the good effects
                  of the exchange from the terrors of the gloomy eye in the forest, to the serene
                  and brilliant dawn in the more open, sunlit land.</p>
               <p>They galloped on lightly beside Joaquin and Felix, a little in advance to the main
                  body, chatting to drive away whatever was troublesome in their minds. Every now
                  and anon they would dart on in a mock-severe chase of a quail, who dropping its
                  proudly-lifted plume on its beak, would skurry along near the ground like a
                  "road-runner" until, rising suddenly, good-bye to anything reaching it but a shot.
                  Clear, silvery peals of laughter rang out on the sonorous air, and snatches of
                  song emulated the birds awakening, while the smiles added fresh charms to the
                  countenances of the young women, and made their eyes sparkle still more
                  brightly.</p>
               <p>After several successive halts the band arrived at length at Arroyo Cantuva.</p>
               <p>What was the joy of that young prince of pillagers at view of the spectacle
                  extremely grateful to a horse-stealer's eyes, that was visible in the valley.</p>
               <p>There were more than a thousand horses, grazing in herbage which brushed their
                  bellies with the high tops or leaping about with floating mane and tail and
                  smoking nostrils through the wild oats and over the clover.</p>
               <p>The stallions were already forming their manadas of a few mares unavoidably<pb
                     n="34-35" xml:id="VAC8324-00000019"/> bly taken in the mass, and every little
                  while a vaquero would have to push his horse into the press and lash the horses
                  about to fight.</p>
               <p>The whole formed a sort of patchwork; the grass for groundwork and the variegated
                  animals for embroidery, almost all being "calico" or "paint" horses, dun,
                  cream-colored, mouse-colored, black, streaked, speckled, spotted, white,
                  stocking'd and nose'd.</p>
               <p>A cluster of tents, white as the snow on Shasta's summit, was glistening under the
                  evergreen madrona. Which proved that the plundering detachment had not only
                  faithfully carried out their instructions, but were on the spot to receive further
                  orders.</p>
               <p>The new arrivals raised the well-known shout which signalled their approach, and
                  all made for the canvass camp at headlong speed, where they dismounted.</p>
               <p>They were immediately surrounded by Valenzuela, Cardoza and a portion of their
                  followers, of whom the remainder were off on a hunt.</p>
               <p>After mutual compliments and felicitations exchanged, the horses were unharnessed
                  and turned into graze with the others.</p>
               <p>The riders rolled off on the grass to enjoy the repose so necessary to them.</p>
               <p>They had slept as only men can sleep who have gone at the full speed of California
                  steeds, who do not know what pacing or a fast trot or any intermediate pace is,
                  for five hours or so, when they were aroused for supper.</p>
               <p>The hunters had returned at nightfall well supplied with game.</p>
               <p>A large fire had been made and from it rose the delicious emanations of bears-meat
                  and birds.</p>
               <p>Quails and grouse, and a few robins, spitted on twigs stuck in the ground, hissed
                  daintily and sputtered before the embers; on the edge of the heap of coals
                  simmered the contents of large iron camp-kettles full of that herb used of times
                  in the old days of El Dorado for tea; a little further off, on a hundred and more
                  huge leaves were spread out as apologies for cloths on which again set tin plates
                  (bright, though old, for Californian air will not rust things, as other
                  countries), bearing portions of Mexican compounds and such "unconsidered trifles"
                  picked up from ravaged districts as Baltimore pickled oysters, New York lobsters,
                  jellies and fruit.</p>
               <p>Apples and pears from the famous San Jose Mission Orchard were side by side with
                  their mates, plucked by Yankee girls in the Bay and the Green Mountain States
                  shipped in a California clipper by the stevedores of the Empire City, and after
                  rounding the awful Cape, rolled out of the side lading-port on San Franciscan
                  shores.</p>
               <p>Beside each plate was more or less temptingly set a tin cup, a bundle of cigars or
                  a packet of cigarettes, and a bottle of wine, whose hue as red as the honey bud
                  that a bee might choose to sleep in, glittered alluringly through the transparent
                  prison-walls.</p>
               <p>The whole formed a display which no sharp-set marauder would have sneezed at.</p>
               <p>On a signal given by the cook: "Pitch in, boys, and never mind us the famished
                  crew took up positions as best agreed with their tastes and went to work as if the
                  banquet was a bank of good yielding earth and they so many hydraulie pipes aimed
                  to wash it away. They did wash it down.</p>
               <p>The seat of honor was occupied by the Chief of the Coyotes and his Clarina.</p>
               <p>On his right hand was Reynardo Felix and his mistress the charming Margarita; to
                  the left Juan Cardoza and the pretty Mariquita.</p>
               <p>This latter had for some time worn mourning for her former lover, the Gonzalez so
                  summarily dislodged from his high eminence in the gallery of rogues El Doradian by
                  Captain Harry Love, and had settled her choice on Cardoza.</p>
               <p>Her love for gay colors had gained her the nickname of Mariposa (the Butterfly)
                  already, which was confirmed by her thus flitting from the dead flower to the
                  blooming one.</p>
               <p>Laughs went up more befitting a Montgomery street negro minstrel hall than a
                  Parisian drawing-room, let us say, but the upper end of the table was more select
                  and the lowered tones there compared to the rougher voices below, was as a cooing
                  of doves to the growling of grizly cubs boxing, dancing and at play together.</p>
               <p>Supper was finished, and conversation was rattling on, when the signal arose
                  again.</p>
               <p>A score of men dashed up as fast as their jaded beasts could go, Mountain him at
                  their head.</p>
               <p>Room was made for them. The cooks went to their work once more, and the later
                  comers plied knife and fingers, while receiving the warm congratulations of their
                  comrades.</p>
               <p>These recruits were natives of Chili, Peru and Sonora, who had been got to-gether
                  by one of Joaquin's best friends, Fernando Fontes, who had accompanied them to the
                  rallying place.</p>
               <p>They brought, as a kind of tribute for their welcome, seventy to seventy-five
                  horses (without their true owners, of course), and Jim announced that two hundred
                  more were corralled in the San Francisco Rancho which would be driven to this
                  retreat during the coming week.</p>
               <p>The talk, thus for the time being interrupted, went on again briskly as before,
                  the new-comers being regaled with stories of which the "immoral" was a lesson for
                  their future exploits.</p>
               <p>Elegant romancing and incredible yarns succeeded one another, and the whole
                  company would have had to have been credited with greatly thinning out the
                  population if the chronicles of crime were believed in.</p>
               <p>In the interludes of hangings, flayings, burnings, shootings and stabbings, one of
                  the girls would sing some melody which from its excessive sweetness had some
                  effect for the moment on the steel-hearts.</p>
               <p>All at once, the general gladness was violently broken into by a quarrel that
                  arose between Three-fingered Jack and Mountain Jim.</p>
               <p>The thing was serious enough, as the reader will see.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>THE OUTBREAK.—JACK PUTS HIS FOOT DOWN AND JIM HAS A CLOSE SHAVE.—FRENCHMEN AND
                     MORE CHINESE.—LOS ANGELOS LYNCHES FELIX, AND HIS GIRL GOES TO JOIN HIM.—JIM AND
                     JACK PART COMPANY.—BLOOD IN THE MERCED.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Mexican had formally laid down a new law of his, thus:</p>
               <p>"I'll never let one of these cursed Yankees put foot in the head-quarters here and
                  be let into the secrets of the band!"</p>
               <p>On which declaration the rupture between the two aforesaid had resulted.</p>
               <p>Mountain Jim, who represented in himself alone the element mentioned, get up on
                  his feet, swallowed his last bite leisurely and replied bluntly:</p>
               <p>"That cock won't fight. I'm an American by birth, but I'm Mexican in heart, and
                  you may all be sure that I have all the more interest in upholding the party by
                  the fact that I don't come to you only to be a butcher!"</p>
               <p>"If you mean me by that," retorted Garcia, "you lie, and you're a coward if you
                  don't freeze to it!"</p>
               <p>At the same time, the robber drew his revolver. To see him rolling his tiger's
                  eyes and frowning with his black brows, like the lightning and thunder on Mont
                  Diablo, and to see his whole face of a devil borne out in its fiendish<pb
                     n="36-37" xml:id="VAC8324-00000020"/> promises by his gigantic limbs, it would
                  take a stout heart to look at him twice before in going in opposition to him.</p>
               <p>But the other was not a man, as he might have said himself, to be bluffed off with
                  big looks.</p>
               <p>At the word "coward" he had grasped his revolver, and he was so quick that he
                  might have had the first shot, but Joaquin had risen and in his sternest, most
                  imperious voice, ordered both of the antagonists to "down with their arms" and
                  have no more brawling.</p>
               <p>"That's agreeable," answered the mountain man. "<emph>I'm</emph> willing to obey
                  my leader's word, though I don't care a dime."</p>
               <p>"Stop a bit," muttered Jack. "I ain't no Jackass-rabbit to have long enough ears
                  to hear <emph>all</emph> orders——"</p>
               <p>Crack! went his pistol.</p>
               <p>But it was one of the new volunteers, who had had the ill luck to be next to Jim,
                  and who had leaped up to fall instantly, mortally wounded. One loud shout broke
                  forth.</p>
               <p>As if moved by the same spring, every man was standing, and all the weapons were
                  leveled at or held against the slayer, ready to prevent his ever again disobeying
                  the chief.</p>
               <p>"No!" said the latter, stretching out his hand. "Jim——Luis, all, down with the
                  arms!"</p>
               <p>The order was obeyed at the word, but all eyes were bent nevertheless on Garcia.
                  He, standing, revolver in hand and finger inside the trigger-ring, eyed his leader
                  with an air of indifference. The silver mounting of the latter's pistol glittered
                  in the rays of the fire as it bore upon the rebel, while, with an angry look and a
                  voice of rage, Joaquin said:</p>
               <p>"Jack, you've disobeyed your leader, and have not only rebelled openly but have
                  added the murder of one of your comrades to your misdeed. And the slain man is not
                  only the one with whom you were not concerned but was one who was an utter
                  stranger to you. You have earned death, and I'll show you that I am a better
                  marksman than you."</p>
               <p>"Dead shot or not, Joaquin," replied Garcia, dropping his weapon and opening with
                  both hands his shirt to lay bare his breast, "I ain't scared. Blaze away, I'm
                  ready."</p>
               <p>As he was defying the shot, a little hand glided round upon the superior's pistol
                  arm, and the sweet voice of Clarina murmured gently in his ear.</p>
               <p>"Pardon him, Joaquin, I entreat you."</p>
               <p>For a space, the would be executioner-judge was indecisive, but, at length letting
                  the muzzle of his revolver droop, he said:</p>
               <p>"Garcia, I can't bring myself to kill you. You're too fearless to leave the world
                  so, and though your bravery is next door to barbarity because you were born so and
                  cannot master your desires——"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, he can't help it!" cried at the same time a number of the desperadoes,
                  who, full of admiration at the wretch's coolness, had already forgotten his
                  crime.</p>
               <p>The corpse was pitched into a hole somewhere, peace was proclaimed, and the
                  jollity went on more uproariously than ever.</p>
               <p>After a night of such revelry. Joaquin despatched Antonio and Guerra, the latter
                  at the head of his division, into the State of Sonora with fifteen hundred head of
                  cattle. He himself turned towards San Luis Obispo, with Valenzuela, Felix,
                  Cardoza, Mountain Jim, Three-fingers and the three women.</p>
               <p>On the ensuing day as they were jogging along a rough pathway in the mountains,
                  they caught sight of a couple of French miners who had crept into one cave of the
                  many to eat their breakfast or dinner—whichever it was—under shelter from the
                  sun.</p>
               <p>"I'm 'a-thiuking," remarked Garcia playing with his dagger, "It would be a good
                  notion to test their pockets."</p>
               <p>"Very well, go on," answered the captain, "but remember, no blood spilling."</p>
               <p>The next minute the cutthroat was confronting the two men and in a voice of
                  thunder ordering them to "shell out or he'd make sausage-meat out of them."</p>
               <p>The blazing eyes of the bandit, the business-like way in which he measured with
                  his steel, and his ferocious mien, spoke clearly enough for the seriousness of his
                  threat.</p>
               <p>So the poor Gauls hurriedly unbuckled their chamois-leather belts and transferred
                  them to the robber, who emptied them hastily.</p>
               <p>"D—— you for a brace of frog-eating swindlers. Money must be scarce as thunder for
                  you pair to have only forty dollars worth of wire gold a-tween you."</p>
               <p>In a moment, he fell upon the unfortunate devils, cut their threats and left them
                  in the cave which became their grave.</p>
               <p>The outlaw commander saw them fall bathed in blood from where he and the rest had
                  pulled up to wait, but he contented himself with grumbling and rode on.</p>
               <p>As it came on sunset, the party reached a narrow canon on which, stiffened in
                  death, two Chinese and a third not far from the same condition.</p>
               <p>Some of the miners, full of the feeling which—years after remaining the same—does
                  not permit the poor Orientals to work near. Europeans, had doubt lessly fallen in
                  with them and been their death, for their awful wounds were made by some such
                  blunt-pointed tools as pick-axes.</p>
               <p>The one still breathing, though his would was not mortal in itself, would have
                  certainly expired in a few days from the absence of proper medical assistance.</p>
               <p>On seeing the troop pass by, the suffering victim lifted his head and in a weak
                  but affecting accent, and with a look which should have wrung pity from the most
                  stony of heart, made out to gasp a few words of supplication.</p>
               <p>"No use for us to stop," said Joaquin, "the poor devil's in a state past any help
                  that we can give him."</p>
               <p>On happening to turn a moment afterwards in his saddle, the speaker perceived
                  Garcia, who had jumped off his horse and run back to the dying man, piercing his
                  already bruised and bleeding breast with his dagger, and after wiping the smeared
                  blade on the now corpse's clothes, cut off the buttons of abelone shell which
                  glittered on the frock. Then springing to horse, he dashed on out into his place
                  once more, pocketing the spoil.</p>
               <p>"Jack," said the robber king, "that's your cruelty breaking out again. Why, the
                  man would be dead in a couple of days."</p>
               <p>"Cruelty," replied the butcher, "I call that coming the friendly over him. I only
                  wanted to shorten his misery—they're splendid abelones, and it's hard to strip a
                  wounded man."</p>
               <p>"Shorten his pangs by churning your six inches of steel in him. Not a word more,
                  sir, your heart must be black as Old Nick's."</p>
               <p>On arriving at the Mission of San Louis Obispo, Joaquin sent Reynardo to Los
                  Angelos and Mountain Jim and Three-fingered Jack (who were now as think as could
                  be together), to San Diego, their instructions being to lay hold on all the horses
                  they could and to find out what was said about the assassination of Captain.
                  Wilson and General Bean.</p>
               <p>About a week elapsed since the departure of the three when in came Texas Jack, a
                  member of the association of marauders, who brought the news that Reynardo had not
                  a sufficiency of the reynard in him to outwit the people of Los Angelos.</p>
               <p>While he had been slumbering after a series of fatiguing fandangoes in a low
                  dance-house, he had been noticed and recognized by an Englishman whom he<pb
                     n="38-39" xml:id="VAC8324-00000021"/> had robbed along with other brigands in
                  the neighborhood of Mokelumne Hill.</p>
               <p>Arrested on the spot, he was accused of complicity in the murder of General Bean;
                  although there was not evidence to bring that charge fully upon him, still the
                  attendant proof of his being capable of such an act was shown in the fact being
                  undisputed of his being one of the ravagers under command of Joaquin.</p>
               <p>During the few minutes given him to kiss the crucifix, the halter was made ready
                  and he took the leap from life.</p>
               <p>So passed Reynardo Felix, without complaint from the honest and peaceable.</p>
               <p>His mistress, Margarita, at first refused to believe the intelligence, but
                  Valenzuela, who presently returned from Los Angelos, confirmed it officially.</p>
               <p>Thereupon, drawing the silver and steel poignard that she had the habit of
                  carrying in so rude a place as a cutthroat's camp where a little of overplus of
                  liquor might make the men forget discipline to gain a young and pretty women, she
                  plunged it into her bosom before anyone could stay her and died pronouncing her
                  lover's name.</p>
               <p>Taking a trip down the shaft to meet Reynardo, was the general opinion attributing
                  the destination of their late partner to quite the opposition to heaven.</p>
               <p>This suicide had not been quite forgotten when, to add another testimony to the
                  truth of misfortunes coming Indian file at one another's heels, the three-fingered
                  brave entered the camp to report his mate's decease.</p>
               <p>Jack and the latter had stepped off the highway into a tavern a few miles from San
                  Diego, where they were scorching their case-hardened throats with a couple of
                  tumblers of detestable liquor, when a party of Americans, who also entered for
                  their drinks, began to regard them with so suspicious a manner that Jack deemed it
                  prudent to warn Jim that they two had better make themselves scarce.</p>
               <p>But the red-eye had had its effect on the mountain-man, and he began to laugh at
                  this comrade and, far from yielding to the advice, went back to the counter for
                  another "something screaming that'd take the hair off a dead red head mule." In a
                  few moments more, another four or five Americans rushed hurrying into the doggery
                  to have treats of one of their number who had found "color" extremely rich.</p>
               <p>The Mexican no sooner saw this reinforcement which destroyed the faint hope of
                  clearing out the bar-room with a fight, leaped over the doorstep, beckoning his
                  companion to follow.</p>
               <p>The latter belched forth a string of oaths with his rummy breath and clung to the
                  counter like a sponge to a rock.</p>
               <p>One of the Americans, all of whom had had a talk together, suddenly stepped up to
                  the drinker and laying a clayey hand on his shoulder, said:</p>
               <p>"I arrest you for being one of Joaquin's gang!"</p>
               <p>Jim tried to strike him; they grappled, and the scuffle began.</p>
               <p>Jack outside, perfectly aware how things would be going on and knowing too well
                  that he single-handed could no more cut his way into his friend now than bore
                  through Tejon Peak with a willow rod, contented himself with sending a couple of
                  bullets through the doorway into the bunch of fighters and, clapping spurs to his
                  horse, "got away," as the P. R. says.</p>
               <p>Some of the men rushed out of the place, but, mounted as Jack was and well
                  started, they had no chance at all on foot of course. An express-train locomotive
                  could hardly have caught him on such a Bucephalus as he bestrode.</p>
               <p>As he rounded the elbow of the road, under the shoulder of the little hill, were
                  some half dozen riders.</p>
               <p>They would perhaps have offered to stop a man looking so excited as the new-comer,
                  but he, with presence of mind, shouted "Gay row at McNamara's! Two bored—I'm after
                  the doctor!" They hesitated, and he was out of pistol-shot before one of them
                  could reflect, and out of rifle-range before one could speak.</p>
               <p>In the meantime, the occupants of McNamara's drinking establishment had
                  overpowered Mountain Jim, who was instantly taken to San Diego and hanged without
                  any other delay than the time strictly required to make the hangman's noose at the
                  end of a rope.</p>
               <p>A month after these disasters, Joaquin, who had only five companions with him,
                  including the two remaining mistresses of the robbers, undertook a pleasure
                  excursion into Tuolumne County, his only design being to divert Clarina, who had
                  been by the self-murder of her friend Margarita plunged into profound sadness.</p>
               <p>They journey slowly but pleasantly and, in a couple of weeks, were treading down
                  the tule-rushes along the River Merced.</p>
               <p>There, on the very bank, in the shade of a clump of ancient trees with most
                  luxuriant foliage still, the hanging twigs of the white oaks switching in the wind
                  and the Spanish moss swinging its gray garlands under the knobbed sycamores, the
                  rippling of the stream and the far off grating of a squirrel's teeth against a nut
                  or the tapping of a woodpecker on a nut-pine being the only sound, the party put
                  up their tents, Joaquin having decided to dwell for some time in this peaceful
                  place where nothing seemed likely to intrude to disturb repose.</p>
               <p>But if honest folk are not let travel paths of lilies for long, the way of the
                  transgressor is still harder. This pretty determination was destined to be very
                  speedily and abruptly destroyed.</p>
               <p>On the following morning, the Sonorian band was awakened by Jack of the Three
                  fingers. Four men in rough coats and high boots, miners evidently, were walking
                  along the other bank of the stream.</p>
               <p>"Shall we invite 'em over to have a drink, and drown them?" asked the discoverer
                  with kindling eyes.</p>
               <p>"Oh, no. If they are not hunting after us, let them pass on."</p>
               <p>While speaking, he peered once more, and more attentively through the slit for
                  loophole which commanded a view of the opposite shore.</p>
               <p>"Ha! no! yes, by the saints!" cried he instantly, as a ferocious expression came
                  upon his features. "Come, Jack! Up, up, Cardoza, Valenzuela! Turn out! Follow
                  me——"</p>
               <p>Without listening to the entreaties and tears of the women, or explaining, he
                  caught up his revolver and leaped out of the tent, the rest keeping close to his
                  heels.</p>
               <p>The travelers were sauntering along tranquilly, without thinking of the least
                  danger when a four-fold detonation rang out, and three of them fell dying or dead
                  in their steps.</p>
               <p>The last only slightly wounded, turned round to see from whence had come the
                  shots.</p>
               <p>"You d—Yankee—don't you know me—Joaquin!"</p>
               <p>Three times he fired, and gave went to a yell of delight on beholding the man
                  measure his length beside the other fallen. He was slain outright.</p>
               <p>"Jack," said he pointing across the water, "I do more than give you permission, I
                  order you to let loose your deviltry. Some of those dogs may live yet—they are at
                  your mercilessness."</p>
               <p>At the first words of the chief, Three-fingers had jumped into the Merced, and
                  before the last ones were spoken, he was breasting the current in which he stood
                  up to the neck. In a couple of minutes he had touched bottom again and was soon at
                  his hellish work.</p>
               <p>With joy the infernal cutthroat perceived that two of the prostrate men were not
                  only not mortally wounded by were trying to rise, disabled as they were.</p>
               <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC8324-00000022"/>
               <p>One fired, with a trailing, broken arm, one shot at Jack, but the latter unharmed,
                  was instantly trampling on him.</p>
               <p>Nor was the enchained demon satiated until he had literally embowelled one and
                  torn the seeking heart out of the other.</p>
               <p>The second two he kicked into the stream.</p>
               <p>Then, on his return, he entered the canvas of the captain, he wanted to know the
                  motive of the latter of hatred and vengeance.</p>
               <p>"Jack, answered he, "three of those scoundrels were in the number of the murderers
                  of my poor wife Carmela, and who drove me away from the mines. I don't know the
                  fourth from Adam, but he deserved what he got from being in such bad company."</p>
               <p>"He's got all he wants and won't travel with that crowd again, I reckon'" said the
                  Mexican, grinning hideously. "I hope, captain, that we come across some more of
                  the fellows who wronged you."</p>
               <p>"If we do meet the villains, your steel shan't rust for want of blood. Bah! that's
                  over. Let's quit these diggings and camp somewhere else to-night."</p>
               <p>Half an hour afterwards, the whole were galloping, Mariposa-wards, near which
                  place, in the rancho of a friend, they took refuge.</p>

                     AN EYE TO THE BLIND.—REPAYS THE TEUTONIC SAMARITAN.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>DURING the month which the gang spent in the neighborhood of Mariposa, the most of
                  them were idle, but two or three went off and performed little strokes of their
                  plundering.</p>
               <p>The insatiable Jack Three-fingers had perpetrated half a dozen robberies
                  accompanied with death-giving in several instances, all alone, when a species of
                  attachment springing up between him and Texas Jack led to both of them undertaking
                  the game together.</p>
               <p>One morning as they strolled on the lookout along the valley from which ran some
                  feeders of the Merced, they heard the ringing of picks against stone, the grating
                  of a spade through sand and the scraping of a knife searching for threads of the
                  precious metal in the rocks.</p>
               <p>Looking down from the top of the hill whereon the two Jacks were, they could see
                  half a dozen men working for dear life at the damp drained bed of a little
                  rivulet.</p>
               <p>They had put up a dam and caught the head waters, which had formed quite a mass by
                  this time, and, not knowing how soon the overflow would happen, were anything but
                  losing time.</p>
               <p>"Come on down," said Garcia, "they ought to be making money, and we'll mark if
                  they are worth the whole of us making a call on. We darsent tackle 'em alone
                  eh?"</p>
               <p>"God, no. By the Lord, if they ain't every one of 'em, some of the crowd who took
                  poor Valenzuela. I know 'em, muddy as they are. Back, back, I had had a narrow
                  enough escape, then, they'll recognize me, I'll warrant."</p>
               <p>"Oh, my eye! rubbish!" growled Jack, falling back under cover nevertheless.</p>
               <p>For the moment the pair looked down, undreamt of, upon the workmen. The latter
                  plied their instruments vigorously, their gasps of breath as they labored
                  unweariedly and the short exclamations of "Good bit, this time, Ned! Lend a 'and,
                  'Arry, to turn this stun hover, bless me hif an 'ell of a chunk hai'nt hunder hit!
                  Best bit yet, by the bricks of Westminster boys! 'Eave 'arf yer scoopful hinto my
                  bag, Hackney, that black sand's hall 'pay,' 'ard h'as h'it h'is!"</p>
               <p>Every now and then, one or two of them would run up on the bank to the hut, one
                  side of which had had the planks removed to make the "tom" lying like a stranded
                  scow beside it, and deposit there the gatherings.</p>
               <p>Gareia ground his teeth an instant but then smiled.</p>
               <p>"So they are the set who nailed our comrade, eh? I wonder how much they've made
                  already—no little, I'll bet. Jack, here," and the three-fingered Mexican whispered
                  something to his friend, which made the latter nod approvingly, smile and lift the
                  cord of his powder-horn over his head. Texas carried a rifle this morning and had
                  a double supply of ammunition. At the same time, the other took off his neck-scarf
                  and folded it up into a kind of bag, into which he tipped a quantity of the
                  gunpowder, thus, forming a rude "carcase," as they call it in military mining.</p>
               <p>"I'll do it," said Garcia, "for it came into my head first. You might have an eye
                  to any who looks up."</p>
               <p>This was the scene.</p>
               <p>A kind of tunnel with the upper half removed, something like two hundred feet long
                  and varying in width from thirty at either end to fifty feet in the width parts.
                  In the centre very nearly, the new drained bed hard clay and gravel covered with
                  rocks and a few stumps of trees inbedded beyond possibility of movement, like a
                  groove unevenly broad by some ten to twelve feet and from two yards to three deep.
                  At the upper end of the little ravine, having a fall of twenty feet, the damned up
                  torrent, spread out and leaking gently on the other side to where the two bandits
                  were plotting. This escaped water did not run into its natural course till having
                  reached almost the other end of the valley, thus, though making the grass and
                  ground wet, not at all interfering with the workmen.</p>
               <p>A little vegetation which had escaped their hands in making the temporary
                  embankment and this line of earth itself prevented the eyes of any of any of them
                  below from perceiving Three-fingered Jack who, with the "carcass" in one hand
                  crawled over the moist, sticky and yet slippery soil towards the penned in water's
                  placid but so potent, sheet insensibly enlarging.</p>
               <p>Texas, rifle at the ready, peered through a barrier of cottonwood saplings nearly
                  choked by willows down upon the miners.</p>
               <p>The latter, in thus venturing to interfere with nature, had not done so very an
                  imprudent an act as may appear. They had spent the whole of the previous day in
                  fashioning the wall, and had let the night pass in the bed becoming dry, their
                  guard being on the alert to prevent anybody surprising them on seeing their idea
                  and beating them off as might have happened in that lonely place. The breakwater,
                  made for the time being, would have probably lasted all that day, especially with
                  the side-loss relieving its expanding prisoner, and they would make a new one on
                  the morrow, if the "yield" of metal was worth that.</p>
               <p>Texas reflected on all this.</p>
               <p>"Good thing for the John Bulls," said he approvingly, "baby Jack's going to put a
                  spoke in your wheel."</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the Mexican had crept boldly out on the mud wall, and the splashing made
                  by a couple of missteps had made Texas shudder, but not the foe look up. They had
                  all their eyes on the ground, prying about for 'indications" of that metal which
                  had lured them from the sea-coast round Torbay, the caves on the Irish Sea, the
                  inland village and the metropolis of millions.</p>
               <p>As far from him as he could, did Garcia push the cloth bomb in among the<pb
                     n="42-43" xml:id="VAC8324-00000023"/> mass of cut wood, brush, stones and
                  earth. He crept back as far as he could, supported himself on his one hand so as
                  to spring up without delay, held out his other, in which was his revolver and, at
                  the same time that he fired, he jumped up and back, turned in the very air and
                  made a prodigious leap.</p>
               <p>At the crack of the firearm, the laborers were not so enwrapped in gold-picking as
                  not to be startled and look up that way. The horror they all felt prevented a
                  sound issuing from them—if they had shouted all together, no matter, for the dull
                  boom would have drowned it as it did all other sounds. The explosion, from being
                  so confined above, did not naturally do the damage concealed in that amount of
                  powder, but was quite as powerful as the author had expected. Not only was the
                  artificial mount split asunder, but the shock acted on the water in some peculiar
                  way—or else the edge of the miniature precipice had been perforated by the
                  element—for, be the cause what it might, a mass of yellowish granite, split
                  downwards and along into a slice like a curtain of a fortress, bearing a crown of
                  mud and loose rocks on its top, leant over and fell into the bed.</p>
               <p>One of the miners was struck by the fragments and killed.</p>
               <p>Another was thrown off his legs by the shock.</p>
               <p>The others thought to fly, but already the enraged confined pond was rushing out
                  in a heavy spout straight at them.</p>
               <p>All this in the smallest space of time.</p>
               <p>The two robbers, Garcia still painting, for to escape from exploding the mammoth
                  cartridge had been a touch and go matter indeed, could only see the fountain
                  playing its side-long jet forward.</p>
               <p>A stream of mingled water, stones, stumps, dirt, first, all of purer water
                  next.</p>
               <p>The empty bed was half-filled already with the released prisoner and rushing along
                  to the opening of the valley with great speed, leading all hindrances in
                  preference to circling around them.</p>
               <p>In about ten minutes, the roar died away, the muddy cascade that had formed for a
                  while a murky rainbow, sunk into a paltry stream, pouring quite tranquilly through
                  the opening began by the powder and enlarged by it.</p>
               <p>No pond above, but an area of ground plastered down by mud, on which floundered a
                  few reptiles.</p>
               <p>"That's done for 'em all, by heavens and their saints!" exclaimed Texas Jack, as
                  he and his colleague stood out on the edge of the chasm to look down.</p>
               <p>At the same time, Garcia gave him a vigorous pull back.</p>
               <p>Bang! went a large pistol in the hands of one of the miners, who had caught hold
                  of some tree's root on the bank and pulled himself out of the danger at the cost
                  of a bucketful or so of spray and of the filling of his boots with water.</p>
               <p>He had remembered the shot that had preceded the louder report and, when on the
                  safe land, had used his eyes more to discover the author of the evil than to look
                  after his no doubt dead comrades.</p>
               <p>Hence, when the bandits above came into view, he had kept close, only hasting to
                  re-prime the large horse-pistol which he had not lost from his girdle.</p>
               <p>"Hit, Jack?" queried Garcia, emptying two barrels at the man, whom they missed
                  from the distance.</p>
               <p>"No, Jack. And you?"</p>
               <p>"I'm hunk. Of course, I ain't hit if you're not; he couldn't have had two
                  scattering balls in."</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, the survivor had, after a hesitation as to whether he should try to
                  enter the hut, turned to the hills and began climbing with all haste.</p>
               <p>On the instant, Garcia was rolling and jumping down the ascent like a bighorn and
                  running along the bank of the rivulet to get a good place to leap across.</p>
               <p>Texas Jack took steady aim with his gun, it cracked and spat fire, but the man
                  without a stop, continued his way.</p>
               <p>"Missed," yelled Garcia, lifting his revolver.</p>
               <p>"Hit!" said Texas.</p>
               <p>Indeed, just as the fugitive's foot was pressed upon a jutting crag, he leaned
                  backwards though his head fell forward on his breast, half turned and, completely
                  losing his balance, pitched sideways downwards, shooting along like a limber
                  plank. Garcia had jumped into the water and was at the spot where he fell.</p>
               <p>The wounded man said something indistinctly and died before the Mexican could
                  pierce him with knife or shoot him.</p>
               <p>"What did he say?" asked Texas Jack, who had crossed and reached the place as his
                  comrade stripped the corpse of its gold-belt.</p>
               <p>"'Merry,' or 'Mary,' I don't know," answered the robber, thrusting his three
                  fingers into the divisions of the wash-leather to feel the quality of the dust and
                  grains. "All I do know is that he came down the hill quicker than he went up."</p>
               <p>"It couldn't have been 'merry,' for he was anything but that with my bullet in his
                  backbone," said the Texan.</p>
               <p>"What of it? Make haste till we clear out the shanty," and the two ran to the
                  cabin.</p>
               <p>They found themselves foiled. The miners had prudently buried what they had gained
                  in previous "exploiting" beyond their ability to carry on their persons, and all
                  that was in the hut was the gatherings of the morning, some few pieces of the
                  "cucumber-seed" size being cleaned, but the rest being still in bits of stone and
                  glittering in conglomerates of sand.</p>
               <p>"Curse it!" swore Garcia. "We ought to have known it."</p>
               <p>They took what they could quickly. The Texan proposed following the course of
                  let-loose streamlet to find the bodies swept before its first rush, but the other
                  insisted on a return to the camp.</p>
               <p>"Garcia," said Joaquin at a private conversation with the man, "have you noticed
                  that new hand Floresco?"</p>
               <p>"The milksop, who always speaks against bleeding a sheep after one fleeced it.
                  Yes, captain. Is he a traitor? I thought so—shall I?" and Jack touched his knife
                  meaningly.</p>
               <p>"No, no, there's the making of a dare-devil in him, I fancy, but he must be
                  red-handed. I don't suppose he has ever killed a man yet."</p>
               <p>"Time he began," said Jack, "there's a boy of fourteen in Jackson who killed two
                  men in a street fight last month."</p>
               <p>"As you say. Well, take a stroll. Let Floresco be one of them and make him settle
                  a man."</p>
               <p>"All right. "If he don't down he goes."</p>
               <p>Off went Jack, and by nightfall he and his trio, including the designated youth,
                  were waiting, chewing the ends of their cigarettes impatiently, for passers along
                  the road out of Mariposa.</p>
               <p>It was just the time when a few, and very few way farers might be expected. All at
                  once a sound of several horses made their horses prick up their ears, and the
                  masters start up.</p>
               <p>Three horse dealers were returning from the mines, and had allied their forces for
                  security, as each carried the proceeds of sales about them.</p>
               <p>"There you are, Floresco. Go in!" said Jack, giving his charge a push out of the
                  hedge of scrub spruce.</p>
               <p>The young man resolutely planted himself in front of the three riders, displaying
                  his pistol.</p>
               <p>"Halt! No passing here till we men of the highway assay your dust."</p>
               <p>There was a moment of surprise and perhaps a little fear in the three. But one of
                  them, the middle horseman, who recovered his coolness more quickly than his
                  fellows, jerked a pistol out of his holster.</p>
               <p>"Dry up, and step aside, or I'll break your head!" said he.</p>
               <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC8324-00000024"/>
               <p>At this juncture, a chorus of hoarse voices sang out of the bush:</p>
               <p>"Joaquin is here! down with your spit-fire, you fools!"</p>
               <p>Out jumped the three bandits.</p>
               <p>"Drop your belts on the ground, or you're dead meat!" roared Garcia in a voice
                  which was not his sweetest.</p>
               <p>They obeyed, except the centre cavalier, who cocked his pistol.</p>
               <p>"Now, Nopal Blossom (Floresco's nickname), lether up!" cried Garcia. "It's you or
                  him!"</p>
               <p>The young man saw the speaker's eyes blazing in the dusk like a firebrand blown
                  upon. He nearly touched the man, and fired. The victim, at the start of his horse,
                  fell back and glided off the croup a dead man.</p>
               <p>His pistol fell to the ground with him, but the cap had dropped off and the hammer
                  struck the nipple without an explosion following.</p>
               <p>"They show fight, eh?" growled Garcia, "don't leave 'em a color of metal."</p>
               <p>So the three were completely despoiled, and the robbers retired, well pleased at
                  having gained so much coin as they did, and patting Floresco on the shoulder
                  applaudingly all the way of the return.</p>
               <p>For three days the robber of the mutilated hand had been absent from the band, and
                  fear had been excited about him, but no news of accident having arrived to him
                  from justice was to be found in any of the surrounding settlements.</p>
               <p>When he did show himself after that time, he was dressed in new clothes somewhat
                  too large for him and had his never very handsome phiz ornamented, for nothing
                  could, make it worse, with a dreadful black blood-blister and bruise beside one of
                  his eyes.</p>
               <p>This was the story which he told.</p>
               <p>He had wandered away from the peopled parts just in mere idleness, and camped in
                  the wilds like the savage he was.</p>
               <p>In the night-time while sleeping with his provision-bag as a pillow, something, a
                  stray coyote in all likelihood, had stolen it without his being aware of his
                  loss.</p>
               <p>Enraged, he had started on the trail the first thing in the morning, when he had
                  found the tatters of the satchel, but everything it had contained, to the very
                  tobacco, eaten or carried off. This had made him give up his stay in the solitude.
                  Hungry with so much exercise and no breakfast, he had tried to bring down
                  squirrels with pistol-shots, but not one would let him get within range, like the
                  birds.</p>
               <p>In the afternoon he had struck a trail of some animal of the deer kind, and he had
                  followed it. As the sun went down, he had perceived small foot-prints running
                  among the large hoof-marks and had recognized them to be made by one or two
                  wolves.</p>
               <p>The deer was probably wounded, for its steps were uneven and in many cases it had
                  tumbled over stones and vines instead of leaping them.</p>
               <p>This gave Jack hope, and he "loped" on as doggedly as the wolves.</p>
               <p>At length the track doubled and turned back on itself, and to the pursuer's
                  surprise, a crash in the bushes to one side attracting him thither, he saw an
                  antlered body stagger along blindly.</p>
               <p>He gave it one shot and was taking up the chase when a couple of growls behind him
                  drew his attention that way.</p>
               <p>A pair of red wolves, tongue out and their paws all bleeding and dusty, had
                  stopped on seeing this human barrier to their love of the chase and evinced their
                  disapproval of his smoking revolver.</p>
               <p>"You little cusses!" said Jack, and he let the nearer one have a couple of shots,
                  which made it roll over and over in the chinkapin bushes with broken leg and
                  perforated head.</p>
               <p>To the man's surprise, the other did not not scuttle off, tail between legs, as he
                  had taken for granted.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, with a "warr-r-r!" deep down in its slimy throat, it fearlessly
                  flew at the bandit, who actually pushed it from him with his revolver.</p>
               <p>It was up again in a moment and making its fangs meet in the front of his boot-leg
                  began to tug at it, at the same time as giving full play to its no less sharp
                  claws.</p>
               <p>Down went the man on the sugar-pine leaf carpet and the two growled and fought
                  till Garcia, remembering himself, pushed the barrels of his revolver into the
                  belly of the infuriated animal, and kept pulling the trigger for he had a new
                  patent self-cocking arm) till the remaining loads were all exhausted in a
                  twinkling.</p>
               <p>He actually had to hammer with the butt on the entangled teeth to get loose. Then
                  he kicked the dead beast over towards its mate which was howling in the bushes,
                  and indulged in a pæan which was composed of the choicest curses in the English,
                  Spanish, Indian and mining vocabularies.</p>
               <p>Loading as he went, the Mexican took up the pursuit once more.</p>
               <p>From the extreme wildness of the animal's track, he conjectured that his last shot
                  had seriously injured it.</p>
               <p>After a quarter of an hour's run, turning and twisting, a snorting and bleating of
                  pain in a thicket told him where was the prey.</p>
               <p>He looked through the natural fence of saplings, which had sprung up into place
                  again after being bent down by the brute.</p>
               <p>An elk, larger than he had fancied it when he had seen it in motion, was standing
                  on tremulous legs, its flanks heaving and, at each inflation, fresh blood leaping
                  out of a hole in it's flecked skin.</p>
               <p>A few twigs dangled on its horns, one of the branches of which had lost its
                  tip.</p>
               <p>The nostrils snuffed the air, but the eyes, though open, told the whole story of
                  the poor beast's blundering pace.</p>
               <p>It was stone blind from some cause or other, perhaps age, for it was now weaker
                  than a long run would have made it.</p>
               <p>While Jack looked, its joints gave way and, first settling down on its haunches
                  the head and breast upheld for a moment as proudly as of old, drooped and, with a
                  choking sob and a roll of the poor sightless orbs, the elk tumbled over on its
                  side.</p>
               <p>A rush of steam from its wide nostrils, and no more sound.</p>
               <p>"Save powder to drop so, you do!" muttered Jack, pushing into the sort of small
                  clearing.</p>
               <p>He returned his revolver to his belt, in exchange for his knife and advanced.</p>
               <p>A slight breathing was yet in the prostrate mass, but the wound had clotted itself
                  up and ceased to flow.</p>
               <p>Jack boldly grasped the upper branch of horns and bent down to draw his blade
                  across the neck which he tightened.</p>
               <p>His relish for leisure butchery was the cause of his mishap.</p>
               <p>As if galvanised, the supposed corpse was only too lively. The hoofs struck out
                  furiously and made the sticks and stones fly.</p>
               <p>The man, clinging to his hold, felt his arm nearly pulled from the socket and
                  himself jerked upward as the elk staggered to its feet.</p>
               <p>Then, Jack saw and felt things as in a dream. His revolver fell out of his belt,
                  his knife left his hand stuck somewhere in the head to which he clung.</p>
               <p>A series of plunges, tossings, kickings and short runs terminating in sudden
                  steps, a sensation of being pushed rapidly through the air and of being driven
                  into a mass of half-yielding thorny twigs. And he was senseless.</p>
               <p>When he came to consciousness,—he could not tell how long afterwards,—he was in a
                  small rude cabin, pervaded with a small of cooking, on a blanket on the earthen
                  floor. Over one of his eyes was a large bandage and on one arm was another.</p>
               <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC8324-00000025"/>
               <p>"Hullo!" cried he, sitting up and looking around in amazement, what in the name of
                  the devil is this?"</p>
               <p>A man entered the hut while he was wondering. An undeniable German and as
                  undeniably a miner, for his dress and the earth upon it showed that.</p>
               <p>"Ah, ha! you bees came around, hein?" said he good humoredly.</p>
               <p>"It looks so," answered Jack.</p>
               <p>"It looks so, 'yah, you spicks truth," said the other laughing, as if there were a
                  joke in the response.</p>
               <p>To the Mexican's questions he replied in broken English that he was a native of
                  Kreuznachtenberg, heaven knowns exactly where, and that he had come out for a
                  fortune not yet found (added he with peasant's prudence) to the land of gold.</p>
               <p>More immediately, he had located himself here all alone, and when out to seek a
                  better place and some eatables in the way of feathered and hairy animals had
                  chanced to strike the elk's trail.</p>
               <p>He had followed it for a time without observing the man's steps and, when he did,
                  had kept on hoping to see a fellow being.</p>
               <p>He had entered the clearing, where he beheld the carcass of the elk, and a
                  supposed dead man rammed into the blushes. He had shouldered the latter and a
                  piece of the other, and—that was the whole. He was too good a man to expatiate on
                  so simple and natural an act as thus relieving his "brother-man," as he called
                  him.</p>
               <p>"You're green," said Jack, in these diggings or you'd a sliced the man and marched
                  off with the game."</p>
               <p>The Samaritan did not perceive the necessity of cruelty, and Jack did not try very
                  hard to convince him.</p>
               <p>"You has no tools," remarked the other, "dit you leab your lansmen somewhere?"</p>
               <p>"Me? Oh, I was prospecting when I cut after that plaguey deer—burn him!" responded
                  the Mexican.</p>
               <p>"Burn him!" ejaculated the other. "I forgotted!" and with that he hurried to the
                  cause of the odor that filled the one chamber, a huge joint of the elk being
                  roasted on a flat stone, which formed the hearth.</p>
               <p>Enough that Jack displayed all the winning ways that he could muster and quite
                  conquered the German, that, the latter brought out his small keg of liquor and
                  that the two went to bed—blankets, we mean, similarly fuddled.</p>
               <p>The German dreamed, as a result of certain words that the Mexican had dropped,
                  that Jack, his partner, guided him to a spot covered with bushes which had to be
                  raked away with a mammoth deer's horns, when a layer of unclayed, unalloyed gold
                  blazed in his eyes, that he returned to his birthplace with the long name, a man
                  far more wealthy than the chief syndic, bought the title and estate of the
                  Count-baron of Hochberg-Johaninsheimerweissbieren, married the girl whom he had
                  last seen knitting at her father's cottage-door, and who had pricked him with a
                  needle in the parting salute.</p>
               <p>The robber, on the other hand, awoke instead of revelling in visions, as soon as
                  he slept off the liquor's fumes, considered for a moment, rose noiselessly, felt
                  about for the weapons which he had remarked to be placed in a certain shelf, and
                  knifed without a shade of remorse the man who had saved his life.</p>
               <p>This done, still in the dark, he searched the hut, flashed powder to find hiding
                  places, and not poorly paid for his scrutiny, for the industry and steadiness of
                  the Teuton had reaped its fruit for all of his inexperience.</p>
               <p>Thus laden with the spoils, as guiltily acquired as could be, he came to the camp
                  to be welcomed as the prodigal son would have been greeted by the spenders of his
                  substance, had he broken his repentance and robbed his father after the feast for
                  his return.</p>

                  <p>JACK THIRSTY AGAIN.—THE DRUNKEN MINER.—DARING OF JOAQUIN.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE misdeeds in the neighborhood of Mariposa and so fluttered the people that it
                  was deemed proper to make a shifting of position. The whole party crossed the
                  Merced at a good ford and, now striking deep into the wooded land, now climbing
                  highlands, directed their route to meet a trail by which they could reach the
                  forks of the Tuohume River, that district where the best and finest gold is
                  obtained throughout the Queen of the Pacific's realm.</p>
               <p>Thereupon, as soon as the stream had been passed with the horses, they went on
                  swiftly until near Shaw's Flats.</p>
               <p>On all sides rang out a medley of picks, spades, toms, cradles and all the
                  instruments and mechanical assistants that could be brought into use to the
                  miner.</p>
               <p>Numbers of Chinese in that quarter, which has been named since "Chinese Camp" for
                  pre-eminence as the Celestial's resort, had pitched their tents on neighboring
                  points, and, working in company, were assiduously working and "clearing up"
                  profitably the refuse of the claims abandoned by others from a "pile" having been
                  made out of it or from disgust at the scanty returns.</p>
               <p>The whole scene, animated by the spirit of Labor, glowed with peace, prosperity
                  and contentment.</p>
               <p>Joaquin and his followers did not try to avoid general observation.</p>
               <p>The state of the country favored him as much as the English and French and German
                  robbers were shielded by the usages of their own times. It was too common a custom
                  for wagoners, horse-dealers, drovers, hunters and travelers of every description,
                  to camp for days and sometimes during whole weeks, on the edge of a water-course,
                  or under the shade of some Big Tree in a lonely valley.</p>
               <p>And besides, there was no uneasiness to be excited by the band being well equipped
                  and armed; the habit—widely spread in Californian society of never going even to
                  see your next door neighbor without a "toothpick or a (lead) pea-blower,"
                  permitted Captain Joaquin and his cutthroats to flash out their steel in perfect
                  security until they should willingly or perforce reveal their true character.</p>
               <p>The commander of this illustrious collection of desperadoes possessing sums more
                  than sufficient for temporary requirements, decided to make some weeks' stay
                  around the Flat.</p>
               <p>His chief intention was; while resting and living in an agreeable style, to spend
                  several hundred dollars in circulations in the gambling houses, the saloons and
                  the fandangoes of the vicinity.</p>
               <p>Chance served him wonderfully: he found some miners, who—having raised the
                  quantity of wind (otherwise dust) which answered their expectations and being on
                  the point of going home (great word! in those days, of Californian (y)ore)—were
                  quite willing to dispose of the little cabin which they called their house, along
                  with all the household utensils with which it was not badly supplied.</p>
               <p>Situated on a site not very tempting, which the association of diggers had
                  "coyoted" into and worked over and over again until the last precious particle had
                  been removed, the hut was doubly valuable to the new tenauts from its being in
                  among the gold-seekers and yet not of them, for there they were not likely to be
                  sought for.</p>
               <p>Every evening, the robber leader, accompanied by Cardoza and two girls, would
                  saunter through the growing village for amusement.</p>
               <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC8324-00000026"/>
               <p>The headquarters, during this time, was entrusted to Valenzuela and Garcia, a
                  formal order enjoining the latter to remain peaceable and, under no pretext
                  whatever, to compromise by theft or murder, the asylum of the whole band.</p>
               <p>For the first time in his life, the butcher bandit seemed to have lost his
                  hankering for human blood, and, during a period of three weeks, remained near the
                  common resort sharing his time between cards and liquor. In the end, never the
                  less, his nature retook the upperhand.</p>
               <p>One evening, while Valenzuela was at Sonora along with Joaquin and the others, the
                  wretch whetted his steel and set out in search of a victim.</p>
               <p>The Chinese, squatting before their tents, were busy in examining the proceeds of
                  the day's work, sorting and chatting over the "flour" "grain" and "shot" gold, and
                  raising a chorus of thanksgiving to Joss no doubt whenever a five-dollar piece,
                  (common to American miners but extraordinary to them) was displayed.</p>
               <p>Jack's eyes caught fire with a savage lustre resembling that on a hunter sighting
                  favorite game. But, as the Americans had tents not very distant, all around the
                  abodes of the sons of the Sun and brothers of the Moon, the bandit, who
                     <emph>only</emph> had the wish to cut off two or three heads and not to get
                  into a fight with a cord in perspective, continued to walk on in the direction of
                  Sonora with the hope of coming up not only to a better place but a more
                  advantageous chance.</p>
               <p>On the way, at different times, he encountered parties of miners and raw hands,
                  but as they were armed to the teeth, he let them alone in their bristling array;
                  once in a while a stray Celestial was encountered, but as they were always hanging
                  near to the large parties, he had to overcome his eagerness to spring upon the man
                  and keep his weapons under his blanket.</p>
               <p>At the place where the Sonora Road forks and makes an elbow, too, he turned
                  toward. Columbia and, when he was only a short distance from that town, sat
                  himself down by the wayside to tranquilly enjoy the flavor of a cigarette.</p>
               <p>It was a fine evening, the sky sparkling splendidly.</p>
               <p>Jack, before going any farther, resolved to take a little rest and smoke on till
                  two or three in the morning. Then, he thought, on retracing his steps to his
                  chief's cabin, he might, without too much danger, walk in among the Imperial
                  subjects, probably stupefied with opium, and slash half a dozen to death as easily
                  as kiss your hand.</p>
               <p>While he was foretasting the pleasure he promised himself in such cold-blooded
                  slaughter, he was interrupted in his reflections by a noise of footsteps,
                  intermingled with the sound of a voice—man's it is hardly necessary to add, for a
                  "live woman at the diggings" was a Barnum's feat in the times we write truthfully
                  of—endeavoring to sing fragments of melodies derived rather from the operas of
                  Rice, Christy, Buckley and S. C. Foster than from those of European
                  celebrities.</p>
               <p>By listening to the laughable medley which the vocalist produced, it could be
                  guessed instantly that he was like a ship rounding the Horn, half seas over.</p>
               <p>Multiplying by the forces concentrated in rifle-whiskey the original powers of the
                  lungs, the stranger, after having manfully "engaged" Zip Coon the Ancient, and Jim
                  Crow, ran on, without a bar or rest, into Possum up a Gum Tree, Hoop Jamborine and
                  Coal Black Rose. He began next to whistle a combination of Yankee Doodle and Old
                  Lang Syne; but, not finding his execution of this satisfactory to his Meyerbeerian
                  taste, threw his whole powers into a mingling of songs, yells, and shrill
                  cat-calls.</p>
               <p>This new sort of harmony may thus be hinted to the reader (the delicate shades are
                  left to the fancy): <q>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>"Oh, oh! Susannah! don't you cry for me,</l>
                        <l>I'm gwine (hic!) to Cali (hic) forny with——</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> "hooray! hooraw for hooroo! hip! ki—yi-i i! (Apache charging-cry!) I don't
                  care a cuss for nothin'. Wagh—a—wagh—a—a (Comauche) th' hundred-an'-one-dol'r nug
                  (hic!) nugget—(Slow scalp-dance chant) hay, yay! Hullo, old boy," added he, trying
                  to pull up short in front of the smoker.</p>
               <p>"Go on, go on," said the Mexican, not minding him; "you're drunk all over like the
                  'paint' on Poor Man's Creek gold."</p>
               <p>"Who in h—are—" began the man fiercely, but his ferocity vanishing, he smiled,
                  then scowled, then remembered the only words he had caught of the speech and, hurt
                  at the implied contempt, went on: "Look here, you don't know me—come an' take a
                  nip. I've made a steep lot on the bed-rock—I foun' the hundred an' one nugget in
                  the Dead Man's Canon pocket—I did, I'll bet yer! it's in the papers—Come an' take
                  a—drink or fight's the word—I can lick any man—any smoker—any two smoke—I tell you
                  what, you're mean as earth that ain't pay-durt! You won't? you're a—go to the
                  devil, then!"</p>
               <p>And, having found that he must either move or fall, he——without waiting to follow
                  Crockett's to "be sure you're right,"—"went ahead" by zig-zags, uttering a
                  preliminary shout audible for a mile around, to clear his throat and resumed his
                  interesting lay.</p>
               <p>He had not gone far from Jack, tacking, backing, and filling, as he did, than the
                  latter, falling upon him unexpectedly, before he had time to change his joyous
                  ballad into a cry of pain, struck him to the earth with a half dozen dagger-blows
                  between the shoulders.</p>
               <p>In all haste the murderer ruminaged the pockets of the corpse.</p>
               <p>After having detached a heavy waist-belt, which contained in coin, dust and some
                  fine half-inch "moccasin" pieces upwards of three thousand dollars, Three-fingers
                  retreated at a run to the cabin, where he flung himself on the bed for repose.</p>
               <p>Four or five hours afterwards, in dashed Joaquin and Valenzuela.</p>
               <p>The first ran straight up to Jack and, with a violent shake, tore him out of his
                  slumber.</p>
               <p>"What's up now?" demanded the latter, at the point of using his weapons.</p>
               <p>"A man's body has been found on the highway," was the answer, "and from the number
                  of useless wounds, I believe that he can only have been laid out by you."</p>
               <p>"Are you quite sure of it?"</p>
               <p>"Yes! so sure that I want no denial of it. But do you know who it is you
                  killed?"</p>
               <p>"No. I ain't sure I did kill. He has probably eaten some poison oak leaves for
                  tobacco."</p>
               <p>"No nonsense."</p>
               <p>"No, in truth," made answer Garcia, assuming an air of mock humility, "and I must
                  say an idea that you might have need of a little funds, and I made that game come
                  down with the dust. I have the honor," concluded he with Mexican gracefulness and
                  politeness, brute as he was, "to present to you the result of my hunt, and a very
                  pleasant heft it has!"</p>
               <p>"Very well, Jack," said the chief as he weighed in his hand the money-belt held
                  out to him, "certainly it's a nice round sum, and comes in very handy, for the
                  water was going down on the bar. The trouble of the thing is that, as I have
                  reason to believe, the man who ran against your knife is one of the two miners of
                  whom we bought this shanty. They could not resist having a fare well bender, and
                  they have been spending money furiously all around. The mate of this one, I hear,
                  is at Sonora and ten to one, he will tell about the sale and bring suspicion on
                  us."</p>
               <p>"What do you think of doing in that case?" inquired Jack.</p>
               <p>"Stay myself here for a day or so, while you and Valenzuela put off hot foot for
                  Stockton. Clarina and Marquita are already on the way with Cardoza, and you will
                  probaby catch up to them before they get to the town."</p>
               <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC8324-00000027"/>
               <p>"And he had best start at once, both of us as you say," said Valenzuela "To
                  horse!"</p>
               <p>In a few minutes, the steeds were saddled and bitted.</p>
               <p>Jack and the last speaker galloped off at the designated direction, and their
                  leader rode away slowly towards Sonora.</p>
               <p>The dawn was breaking, and the gaming-hells were being choked up already with
                  blacklegs and outsiders, all conversing animatedly about the Last Horrid Murder,
                  and expressing great unanimity on only wishing they had the assassin in their
                  power to lynch him.</p>
               <p>Joaquin dismounted and tranquilly strode into a saloon for play, his cloak
                  arranged in the Mexican style.</p>
               <p>He gave a nod to those of his countrymen whom he knew, took a stool and seated
                  himself in a corner of the place not far from the door.</p>
               <p>There was a deal of stress laid on the brutality of the murderer, who seemed to
                  have found devilish delight in inflicting gash upon gash on the victim, although
                  any one of them almost would have been mortal.</p>
               <p>This remark set everybody to swearing most energetically that they would turn
                  every stone to get hold of the guilty.</p>
               <p>"Blast me, with poor powder too," said one in the principal crowd, as he "banged
                  the counter with a not delicate fist, "if I'd be one bit astonished if them
                  greasers had a hand in our friend's going under."</p>
               <p>"What greasers?" asked some one.</p>
               <p>"Why, them bloody Mexicans, of course, who bought out the river claim. Why did
                  they buy it? I don't know and don't want to guess. But there's one d—sure thing,
                  that they haven't done one hour's streak of work. Riding around like circus-men in
                  the States, playing monte all day long like reg'lar professionals, singing,
                  laughing, chinking full and heaping over—that's their style of living since they
                  have kept house in this location."</p>
               <p>"That's so, if it ain't may I never lift pick agin' or see t'other side the
                  Is'mus!" said a third, as tall and slender as the first was stumpy and thickset.
                  "By George, it's the truth! no one can say where them Mexicans of the deuce rake
                  in the tough. Their pockets don't dry up, anyhow!"</p>
               <p>"Swallow me up in a sand-storm!" thundered the first who had spoken; "just give a
                  squint over yonder, Johnny! May I never cross the plains agin, if there ain't one
                  of that Satan's own crowd squatting before us as cool as a cowcumber in a jar of
                  vinegar!"</p>
               <p>He levelled his finger at Joaquin.</p>
               <p>"It is one of 'em, as true as you live! If he understood English, he'd be
                  shivering in his yellow skin—by all the blue blazers, I'll go take his
                  hide—see!"</p>
               <p>Joaquin had not lost one word of the above elegant conversation. Yet he had dwelt
                  unaffected until the end, and all he did was smile and rise with the utmost
                  willingness when the man strode over to him and laid his heavy hand upon his
                  shoulder, saying:</p>
               <p>"I'm a-thinking you're caught at last, my old boy."</p>
               <p>The captive, before the smile had quitted his lips, had drawn his revolver,
                  reversed it and dealt his captor a most vigorous and swinging blow, at which, with
                  dented temple, the American fell his whole length on the "puncheon" floor.</p>
               <p>With a wild cat's leap, the chief of the bandits was out of the saloon, and in a
                  second more the clatter of horse's hoofs resounded without on the way to
                  Stockton.</p>
               <p>The Californian Claude Duval was once more free.</p>

                     ROOST.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ONE day was all that was required by the escaped highwayman to overtake his
                  comrades, whom he found at table in a Chicago frame house called a tavern, half a
                  dozen miles out of the town named after the Commodore of so much service to the
                  state and the Union. He acquainted them in a few words what he had been doing,
                  and, on that, all jumped into saddle again. Another hour sufficed to bring them to
                  the end of their journey.</p>
               <p>On the following day, just after sundown, Joaquin, Valenzuela and the
                  three-fingered miscreant, as they strolled along the levee, suddenly had their
                  gaze attracted by three American miners who were making that immense display which
                  has vulgarly received the title of "splurge."</p>
               <p>They were dressed in new suits of dark green, of which they had replaced the
                  buttons by good sized pepites or pieces of scale-gold.</p>
               <p>One wore on his breast, like a European order, a prong of a sluice-fork, the whole
                  the of which was heavily gilt; another was similarly decorated with a
                  cradle-spoon, covered as well with the precious ore.</p>
               <p>The third, except his glazed cap had a nice little lump of some fifty or sixty
                  dollars worth of metal over its peak, was unlike the others as to carrying
                  trophies of the trade.</p>
               <p>They strutted with an air which proved that they were out merely to exhibit
                  themselves.</p>
               <p>"A pretty set," remarked the chief, "they seem to be a least bit vain."</p>
               <p>"I should say so," said Valenzuela, "and if it is founded on a solid base they
                  ought to be owners of a little of the ore."</p>
               <p>"I was just thinking the same," chimed in Garcia, instinctively feeling for his
                  knife; "they'll have to have a six-inch steel shaft sunk into 'em."</p>
               <p>As he concluded his threat, the three cynosures stalked into an eating-house.
                  Joaquin, ordering his followers to await his return, no sooner saw them dis
                  appear, then he darted after them.</p>
               <p>He entered the saloon and sat down at a table not far from the Americans'.</p>
               <p>In less than ten minutes, while trifling with a cup of a queer decoction dignified
                  by the name of coffee and charged just as much for, he gathered all the
                  information of which he stood in need.</p>
               <p>Rejoining his satellites, he turned back with them on the way to the house in
                  which they had temporarily installed themselves in the Mexican quarter of the
                  town, and, as soon as the horses were baited, off to San Andreas.</p>
               <p>When four miles from Stockton, they pulled up, hid the horses in the chapparal,
                  and themselves in the brush near the roadside.</p>
               <p>"Our men will be here very soon," remarked the captain. "On the eve of taking the
                  back trail to their native land with the fortune which they boast of having
                  amassed here, they talk of starting for San Francisco to-morrow. Another ought to
                  have joined them at Stockton at three o'clock to-day, but, as he hadn't turned up,
                  they are returning to San Andreas to find him."</p>
               <p>"A regular windfall for us," said Valenzuela, "it oils the wheel for our
                  idea."</p>
               <p>"Hark! I think I hear them," growled Three-fingered Jack, as he thrust his head
                  through the bushes.</p>
               <p>"Indeed, here they come," agreed Joaquin. "Wait till they're fairly abreast of us
                  and then, boys, upset the cabaleros."</p>
               <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC8324-00000028"/>
               <p>The three miners, at a gentle gallop, were approaching.</p>
               <p>They could be heard dilating openly on the prospect of the old scenes again and
                  their "sure thing" on marriages, and so forth.</p>
               <p>How they were going to make the money fly, how they would stand treat for years at
                  Eastern village-taverns, how they would buy a house for this friend of theirs,
                  show they'd half-kill some enemy and buy off justice. They chatted of their luck
                  at the placers, and laughed to think of the envy felt by their fellow-workmen at
                  their sudden departure.</p>
               <p>And they so sang, so laughed, and told such joyous stories that it proved that no
                  foreboding was putting them on the alert against the ambuscade of evil. Hardly had
                  they come up to the place where lay the banditti in wait than the latter,
                  springing up from the concealment like partridges on a "rise" from the tall grass,
                  grasped the reins of the horses, and, before the unfortunate miners had time to
                  overcome the surprise, a volley at point-blank blew out their brains and emptied
                  their saddles.</p>
               <p>The corpses were carefully stripped and dragged off into a thicket.</p>
               <p>Altogether, the three yielded nearly eight thousand dollars in gold, dust and
                  grain.</p>
               <p>This profitable waylaying over, the chief and Jack Three fingers started off in
                  search of a new refuge, while Valenzuela returned towards Stockton to escort the
                  two women and Cardoza.</p>
               <p>That same evening, the whole party came together once more, on the way into El
                  Dorado County. They crossed part of Sacramento County and encamped on the south
                  fork of American River.</p>
               <p>In a few days, they were joined by Hernando Fontes and his cluster of
                  rogue-grapes, one of the number of which, while scouting among the fringe of
                  tules, had espied the leader and his followers and hastened to inform his
                  superior.</p>
               <p>Fontes had been charged with collecting all the horses he could run off and, from
                  different districts, he had already driven close upon four hundred to the main
                  rendezvous.</p>
               <p>He told Joaquin, that Antonio and Guerra had returned from Sonora to the Arroyo,
                  each bringing a new mistress.</p>
               <p>The captain was well satisfied with the intelligence.</p>
               <p>For an instant, he was on the point of departing with all his gang to the
                  headquarters, so impatient was he to learn the details of his lieutenant's
                  enterprises and to see the new senoritas, but private affairs of much higher
                  importance decided him to defer for sometime the pleasure he proposed to himself.
                  Profiting, however, by the occasion presenting itself, he made Clarina and
                  Mariquita go to the Arroyo, entrusting them to the guard of Cardoza, Fernando and
                  of a couple of other Mexicans.</p>
               <p>In this way, he gave them rest from their fatigues, at the same time that he
                  shielded them from the perils to which he and his might yet be exposed before
                  they, too, could reach the asylum.</p>
               <p>The two young women had hardly left the camp with their guard, than a dispute
                  arose between Mariquita and her lover.</p>
               <p>The former asserted very plainly that the latter was not to be compared to her
                  preceeding flame Gonzalez as regarded affection for her, and declared that she
                  would not have anything to do with him thereafter.</p>
               <p>Cardoza, finding that he suffered shameful defeat in a war of words with her, cut
                  a dainty little switch from the hedge and used it up, bark, inner peel, wood and
                  pith, to a few inches upon the rebel's shoulders.</p>
               <p>The latter submitted to all appearance, with resignation most full and humble; but
                  she was really revolving plans of revenge.</p>
               <p>On the following day, as they both were ascending slowly a pathway which would
                  among the peaks and crags of a very steep sierra, the vindictive Mariquita quita
                  seized the opportunity when they were on the brink of a precipice more than a
                  hundred and twenty-five feet deep and, plucking her tiny but sharp dagger from her
                  bosom, buried its needle-like blade over her lover's shoulder in his heart.</p>
               <p>Cardoza uttered a low moan, and tried to turn around, but, as he attempted this,
                  his horse reared, slipped and toppled over.</p>
               <p>Down they went, rider and steed, to the bottom. Mariquita had so dextrously and
                  quickly executed her project that nobody at all had been witness of it.</p>
               <p>By the time the rest came up, she had restored the weapon to its place.</p>
               <p>She went so far even as to pour out a profusion of tears, very bitter, seemingly,
                  over the loss.</p>
               <p>It may be that they were the work of remorse.</p>
               <p>But in any event, her grief was not of long duration. The trysting-place had been
                  no sooner attained, than, her gaiety returning, the merry murderess had accepted
                  as third gallant a young fellow named Manuel Sevalio.</p>
               <p>Two days afterwards, Joaquin heard of the accident that was said to have befallen
                  one of his command. Fernando having despatched one of his men to carry the
                  tidings, and thought it strange that so good a cavalier had had this happen to
                  him.</p>
               <p>It seemed impossible that any failure on his part had led to the catastrophe.</p>
               <p>With a dozen of his bandits, he went with them to the place to ferret out the
                  facts and to bury the victim.</p>
               <p>They used a different road to that taken by the former party and descended to
                  where lay the cavalier and his horse.</p>
               <p>The corpse was closely examined, but it had been so cut by the points of rocks
                  below that the puncture of the poignard was perfectly past perception. After
                  having carefully removed all the arms and valuables upon the body, the robbers
                  tumbled it into a hole in the sand and left him alone in his homicidal and
                  felonious glory.</p>
               <p>At the end of another week, Joaquin, accompanied by Three-fingered Jack,
                  Valenzuela and Fernando's troop, in all six-and-twenty proved rascals, took to the
                  road to recommence depredations in El Dorado County, as well as in the neighboring
                  one of Calaveras.</p>
               <p>On coming near Mud springs, an isolated hut on the hillside drew their gaze to
                  it.</p>
               <p>Believing it to be unoccupied and seeing at first glance that it was an excellent
                  place in which to spend the night, Jack clapped spurs to his horse, rushed up the
                  plane, jumped off in front of the hut and, throwing open the door, walked in
                  unceremoniously.</p>
               <p>Contrary to the idea that had sprung up, the dwelling was occupied.</p>
               <p>The tenant was a foreigner who was kept to his bed by some serious ailment, and
                  thus gave to the surroundings all that appearance of abandonment and loneliness
                  which had deceived the gentlemen of the highway.</p>
               <p>"Hullo! sick man!" exclaimed Jack, seeing the couched person move.</p>
               <p>"Pour I'amour de—love of God, a doct——" murmured the low, weak voice most
                  supplicatingly.</p>
               <p>"I'm a doctor," replied Jack, disengaging his knife. "<emph>Kill</emph> or cure is
                  my motto!"</p>
               <p>And he drew his steel across the sick man's wasted, yellow throat.</p>
               <p>Two or three of his comrades lent a hand and they carried the body outside and
                  tossed it into a near-at-hand ravine.</p>
               <p>Thereupon the gang took possession of the hovel, which they found to be not poorly
                  supplied with all kinds of provisions, blankets, mining implements, pipes and, of
                  course, a fair stock of the Virginian weed.</p>
               <p>Operations were commenced on the latter by making up a lot of it into cigarettes
                  which kept them smoking for a couple of hours; then they spread out<pb n="54-55"
                     xml:id="VAC8324-00000029"/> their blankets, wrapped themselves up and dropped
                  off quietly into slumber.</p>
               <p>As the Aurora, with her sunny pencil, began laying the colors on the early sky,
                  the commanding bandit sent off three men to the Mud Springs Camp to procure coffee
                  and butter and whatever else was required by the dainty appetites of his
                  freebooters.</p>
               <p>In about two hours, one of them came back, not only alone but empty-handed.</p>
               <p>"'Where are the rest of you?" inquired the chief.</p>
               <p>"Dead!" answered the man.</p>
               <p>"Dead—how?"</p>
               <p>The returned one drew his fingers around his neck and then lifted himself by the
                  ear.</p>
               <p>"Hanged?" asked all.</p>
               <p>"Hung like beef. Yes, captain and comrades mine. Hardly had we set foot in the
                  cursed settlement, and had they two went into a grocery to buy, while I stopped at
                  a bar for my eye-opener, talking to the owner of the posade who was a Mexican,
                  than I heard a h—of a row outside. I looked. Four or five Yankees had told of my
                  mates, covering them with bowies and six-shooters. One, with dreadful loud lungs,
                  was shouting that he recognized Sebastianoel Carpintero for a horse thief, who had
                  even run off not a few head from his own ranche in Sacramento Valley, in
                  eighteen-fifty, and, after being trapped had broken prison.</p>
               <p>And he went on to cry in that same loud voice, that his partner must be one of the
                  same tribe or else he wouldn't be along with him. Just as if that proved
                  anything," remarked the bandit; "why, I've been with honest men often and I—"</p>
               <p>"Never was mistaken for one," said Garcia.</p>
               <p>"Jes' so. However, there was no getting the best of the crowd that that noisy
                  brute scared up. While they hauled up my mates to an ugly tree, I slipped through
                  the back window of the bar and quit."</p>
               <p>"A confoundedly provoking story," said Joaquin. "We must leave this forthwith. If
                  it weren't for the fact that I want to do something more important, with my men,
                  we would go down into the Springs and lay waste the whole paltry camp. But the
                  Yankees may hold their horses, they shan't lose anything by not getting their dose
                  right away. To horse, boys, and away."</p>
               <p>In a trice, the pirates of the placers were mounted and pushing their horses on at
                  such a pace as the pony-express man may take when the redskins are after the mail.
                  At first, good care was taken not to describe a straight line; by zigzags and
                  detours they moved, and after making many stoppages at various places, sometimes
                  to despoil a traveler and at others to bait the steeds, the band drew rein on an
                  eminence of sad and gloomy aspect about a mile from Salmon Falls.</p>
               <p>There they passed the night.</p>
               <p>The spot seemed to have been formed expressly by nature for the use to which they
                  put it.</p>
               <p>Almost entirely concealed by the rocks all around, the wall having its gaps and
                  chinks filled up thickly with inextricably woven briars, there was a central
                  clearing of twenty feet or so in diameter, which was the most comfortable and safe
                  of all robbers' retreats.</p>

                  spirited set to never let a man die unless in the air. "We Mexicans at least half
                  the time prefer to give less elevated deaths."</p>
               <p>"Your'e right there," said Carillo; "hanging is a poor idea. But the Americans
                  will believe in it; they're brought up to it from their birth. Listen to them and
                  you'll hear them swear 'hang it!' they 'hand out' instead of live; 'hang' round
                  bars instead of 'bumming' have pistols that don't 'hang' fire as often as I wish,
                  and so they go on. They must either hang or be hanged that's a fact. But, look
                  here, seeing we may not be able to keep them from stringing our friends up, what
                  prevents us swinging in the breeze every one of them we catch?"</p>
               <p>"Bah!" growled three-fingered Jack, "it's a poor system! When I kill any one, I
                  want to see the 'color' of his blood. Carajo, dry up with your executioner's talk.
                  Let them rope as they please—I stick to steel and lead!"</p>
               <p>"Comrades," said Joaquin, "more than any one amongst you have I suffered by the
                  passion of the Yankees for hanging people, for I saw my own brother strangled. He
                  never had done any harm. It was at a time when I could neither save him or punish
                  the wrong-doers; but since I have taken my revenge and I continue to seek it. But
                  a truce to such sad topics. Let me relate to you an adventure that happened to me
                  not long ago in Tuolumne County."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes! hooray for the captain's story!" exclaimed all voices. "Silence!"</p>
               <p>"I was entering upon the pursuit we gentlemen of the highway have the honor to
                  carry on at the present speaking," began the bandit leader. "I went into Tuolumne
                  County with my followers, amounting to the not very powerful array of seven all
                  told, to the little camp of San Diego, half a mile about from Columbia, you know,
                  which I found to be a place suiting us for many reasons. During daylight, we kept
                  busy at work killing and plundering the diggers, whether we met them in small sets
                  roaming about for placers, or mining in solitary spots after a good result to
                  their prospecting. When the sun went down, we would go and leave in the hells of
                  the town part or all of the money thus made by marauding.</p>
               <p>"As a matter of course, in paying these visits to the monte's quicksands that
                  swallow up one's funds so fast, I had to change dresses every time almost so as
                  not to be known but to be thought in every new saloon a stranger. Among those who
                  had seen enough of me in other days to have recognised me was one constable of the
                  name of Leary, whom I especially took heed to steer clear from for fear that he
                  would dive under my disguise and force me to stand on the defensive. Besides, he
                  was about the only man in the whole once blessed State at whom I hated to level my
                  revolver, for he had never treated me otherwise than with the utmost courtesy and
                  friendship. As I knew that he was fully posted on my going on and as I thought
                  that—being a sworn officer and a man of honor as well—he would employ all his
                  skill, courage and energy to make sure of my arrest and punishment, I was
                  determined, as I say, to never cross his path.</p>
               <p>"Now, one evening, it came to pass that I neglected a part of my disguise<pb
                     n="56-57" xml:id="VAC8324-00000030"/> which I was in the habit of wearing: my
                  false beard was bothersome, and I believed that I could manage well enough to hide
                  my face in my cloak. On coming out of a certain gambling-house at midnight, I took
                  great pains, indeed, to muffle up my head in the folds. As ill luck would have it,
                  just as I stood on the threshold, Leary came along and went in, giving me a very
                  sharp lock as he jostled me. I pretended to notice him in no way; but, the moment
                  I touched the street, I set off at a run through the dark and reached our rallying
                  place.</p>
               <p>"Day had not dawned that morning, before I—being on the lookout, for I always look
                  to my companions' safety before my own—don't I, boys!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes! you're a glorious captain," cried all.</p>
               <p>Joaquin bowed thanks.</p>
               <p>"Just at day break then, I saw suddenly shoot up into sight a number of men coming
                  on quickly towards our tent, led by Leary. You may bet that I had no trouble to
                  guess what they were after. I woke up my slumbering men and all of us,
                  understanding that to fly was the only course, slipped out and dashed down the
                  road with all the speed we had. A volley whistled by us, but did no harm. They
                  followed and cut off three of us, but they—gallant fellows!—though I feared that
                  they were never to cry 'Stand' again—fought as fiercely as a cub-robbed grizzly,
                  and regained their freedom, not the least hurt. I alone was wounded, Leary shot me
                  in the shoulder at the last fire, as they gave up the chase.</p>
               <p>"We were both on foot, you must know, which was what helped our flight, so
                  greatly, for we were lighter men than the big-boned six-foot Americans, and
                  travelled the narrow pathways in the grey light far swifter than they. So we threw
                  Mr. Leary off our trail, and found a new retreat which defied discovery. That was
                  the first time that I was pursued, hunted by the enemy, but, if I had had the good
                  luck to have counted several more helping hands, I vow to you that I would not
                  have yielded an inch."</p>
               <p>"Bravo!" cried the auditors, whose voices united to propose a toast to their
                  leader's health.</p>
               <p>On the following day, the bandits encountered one of their countrymen who was
                  driving between forty and fifty mules, all laden with bales of provisions. They
                  purchased of him a large quantity of flour, coffee, sugar, frijoles and other
                  articles, and continued their march until they had gained the end of a lonely
                  prairie, well covered with trees, under one of which they camped.</p>
               <p>The understanding was that they would remain there a week or ten days to give the
                  animals time to recover strength and the men freedom to rest and amuse
                  themselves.</p>
               <p>At the place where begins the south branch of the Mokelumne River, in a deserted
                  tract, not far from the boundary line of the Counties of Calaveras and El Dorado,
                  was established a mining company composed of five-and-twenty.</p>
               <p>Being out prospecting one day, well armed of course, they had chanced upon this
                  site, and, discovering indications of rich deposits, they had hastened to pitch
                  their canvas house there, well satisfied with a spot which had merely the one
                  disadvantage of being far away from dwellings.</p>
               <p>One morning, as they were finishing the hearty breakfast of smoked beef, salt pork
                  and ship's bread, a young man on horseback came along, stopped and addressed
                  them.</p>
               <p>He was chiefly remarkable for very fine black hair and eyes.</p>
               <p>He spoke English so perfectly that, though he looked like a Mexican or a native
                  Californian, he might have been a man of the States under Mason and Dixon's
                  line.</p>
               <p>They heartily pressed him to dismount and take a bite, or a pull at a brandy
                  bottle, but he politely refused.</p>
               <p>He threw one leg over his horse's neck, however, and sat something like a lady on
                  a side-saddle, and, finding himself at his ease by that means, he chatted freely
                  on different matters more or less relative to the one topic of the day, gold,
                  until he saw one of the miners, who had gone to a spring to get some unmuddied
                  drinking water, return.</p>
               <p>"Jim Boyce," muttered he on his first glance.</p>
               <p>He threw his leg into place again, shook himself into the saddle and gave us horse
                  both spurs.</p>
               <p>Boyce had already shouted:</p>
               <p>"That's Joaquin the robber, boys! Quick, quick, fire!"</p>
               <p>While he cried, he shot with his own revolver at the discovered chief. But
                  uselessly.</p>
               <p>The latter had directed his horse at hazard straight up on the bit of level land
                  thinking to ride along it and off down the end.</p>
               <p>But passage that way he found abruptly cut off by the perpendicular descent of the
                  rocks.</p>
               <p>The only route left, a scarcely practicable one, was a narrow path which ran along
                  the face of a high hill for fully a hundred yards.</p>
               <p>The rocks over which it went, overhanging the stream on the other side, were in
                  the same line as the hill on which the miners had encamped and not thirty yards
                  off.</p>
               <p>To venture upon such an apology for a riding path was a rough act for any man,
                  even a Gaucho of the Pampas, a hunter of the prairies, an English rough-rider or a
                  "Kit Carson" to attempt.</p>
               <p>Not only was there the danger of having a fall from the top of the rocks one
                  hundred feet, but it was a line of no less than a hundred or a hundred and fifty
                  yards on which he had to move within range of the large-sized revolvers which the
                  miners carried, no toy pop-guns, mind you, but ones which "hit to kill."</p>
               <p>Under the very eyes of Joaquin, as, after wheeling, he had to retrace his steps,
                  stood the whole company. As if he were a spectral rider on a phantom steed,
                  however, he flew along the perilous path, casting these words at the marksmen as
                  he passed:</p>
               <p>"I am Joaquin! Kill, if you can!"</p>
               <p>At the same moment, as a platoon responds to the officer's words, the
                  five-and-twenty pieces cracked in a dropping fire, but most of the bullets, with
                  that fault which generally spares a man, went too high and flattened on the stone
                  beside him, and now behind him.</p>
               <p>His sombrero, nevertheless, struck in crown and brim by three bullets and a fourth
                  composed of two that had "wedded" themselves in the flight, strange as that may
                  seem, flew off, flapping its torn pieces like a wounded bird, and sailed downwards
                  after a circling sweep.</p>
               <p>His long black hair floated in the breeze his swift rush caused, like a
                  continuation of the horse's mane.</p>
               <p>Time was too precious for him to dream of returning fire, and he felt but too
                  plainly that safety lay only in speed.</p>
               <p>All he did, Spaniard like, was to whip out his dagger and flourish it over his
                  bare head in contempt.</p>
               <p>The arms spat fire and lead once more, but a loud shout replied through the woods
                  very soon after. The Pirate of the Placers, laughing at the broadside, was sailing
                  away on his equine clipper to the harbor of his crew.</p>
               <p>Now Joaquin was acquainted with Mr. Jim Boyce, and he was aware of the latter
                  possessing a determined character which it was hard to shake from any resolve
                  which it might form. It was probable that he would do something towards checking
                  the exploits of the brigand</p>
               <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC8324-00000031"/>
               <p>Besides, there was a likelihood of his having some knowledge of the different
                  rewards offered here and there to anybody who should take or slay the marauders'
                  chief; and, rich as was the placer which his friends were working, they might, for
                  the money down of the rewards, "take one shy" at the capture, for they could leave
                  enough of their association on the spot to secure claims.</p>
               <p>Miners' Law runs that, leave your grounds for the smallest space of time and John
                  a Nokes or John a-Stiles, first passer-by, may stick in his pick and say: "These
                  diggings are mine—'ware! hands off, whether you please or no."</p>
               <p>A risk was run therefore by the plunderers by remaining any longer in the present
                  halting-place, which was hardly three miles from the American mines.</p>
               <p>Certain, though, that the foe could hardly be afoot before the day's end, that
                  time being fully demanded for getting together of horses and provender, as well as
                  preparation of weapons and munitions, Joaquin conceived one of those ideas, the
                  like of which he had no doubt heard of having often been carried out all along the
                  Texas border, in the Staked Plains, the Great American Desert, the head-waters of
                  the Gila and Red Rivers, and the Cross Timbers.</p>
               <p>His design was, while effectually reducing to nothing whatever projects the
                  pursuers might combine, to make the hunted ones master of their chasers'
                  wealth.</p>
               <p>Knowing that there is no reason that a trail cannot be laid during the dark, but
                  sure that—until gas shall be introduced into the wilderness—it is impossible to
                  follow it under such circumstances, he ordered his men to truss up the girths of
                  the horses and be ready to journey on again.</p>
               <p>Not a question was put of course, to the leader at so seemingly unwarranted a
                  command, but by a few minutes, all were ready, toe in the box-stirrups, reins in
                  hand.</p>
               <p>Joaquin put himself at the head, and, in the deepest stillness, the cavalcade
                  struck due east through the long avenues of sugar-pines vaulted over head with
                  bluish green foliage. The pace was a rapid one at which they went until nightfall,
                  by which period they had got over twenty miles. They pressed on as long as they
                  could see, and at length halted.</p>
               <p>Fires were built of boughs, pulled down by lassoes, to keep off wild beasts, for
                  in the woods, the smell of cooking was likely to attract them.</p>
               <p>The horses were tied up as customary, and the men not on duty rolled themselves up
                  in their zarapes.</p>
               <p>The watchers charged to attend to the security of the camp, relieved one another
                  every half hour until sunrise, the spells of guard being so short to make each
                  sentry the sharper.</p>
               <p>At the first peep, all were aroused and to horse once more, five hours had been
                  the time given to repose.</p>
               <p>Until noon, the ground was got over with the same celerity as on the previous
                  evening. They were in the cup of a most enchanting valley, carpeted, as Nature
                  delights to do in the Golden Paradise, with richest flowers, changing hues and
                  species month after month.</p>
               <p>It was watered by a limpid brooklet which, sweetly singing, stole a path through
                  the roots of a clump of trees.</p>
               <p>Twenty miles must have separated the fugitives from the scene of their night's
                  encampment. Two hours pasturage was given to the animals, and the same time for
                  feasting to the masters.</p>
               <p>They resumed the march, after having left marks tending to make the pursuers
                  believe that they had passed the whole night there; though, riding on until
                  nightfall, they added another score of miles to the space between.</p>
               <p>They made a short stoppage, lit fires and ate a hasty supper, after which,
                  mounting, they traced a circuit of five miles, wheeled suddenly to the west, and
                  camped at about three o'clock in the morning a day's ride from their last
                  stage.</p>
               <p>At the end of several days of such moves, alternate dashes and halts, the band
                  found themselves in one of the clearings in which they had already encamped.</p>
               <p>Jim Boyce and his friends the miners had indeed taken up the trail of the
                  banditti, on the following day to that on which Joaquin, in scouting for himself,
                  had entered the lion's jaws.</p>
               <p>Every night they halted by the abandoned fires, hoping—a very natural
                  calculation—that eventually they would come in contact with the Mexicans, however
                  far the latter might go. They were not experienced "trailers," or they might not
                  have been deceived with the "planted" tracks.</p>
               <p>Joaquin could hardly constrain his smile of immense satisfaction when he
                  discovered, by tokens that could not lie, that Boyce, whom he considered as the
                  most dangerous enemy, had fallen into the trap and was even now in motion forward
                  quite near him.</p>
               <p>Night was come.</p>
               <p>After having galloped all day long over mount and plain, through forest and water,
                  the chasers, seated at ease around one of the last fires of Joaquin, which they
                  had raked together and rekindled, smoked while chatting and laughing.</p>
               <p>Their tired horses did not reveal the proximity of strangers, but there were
                  strangers indeed in the shrubbery.</p>
               <p>The robbers had crept in towards the campers-out as close as they dared, and their
                  extended weapons covered each a breast of which the heart was soon to cease to
                  throb.</p>
               <p>All of a sudden, some twenty shots rattled out one close upon another into a long
                  blending of reports.</p>
               <p>The ring around the fire burst into flame for a moment just as a sable cloud gapes
                  to emit the lightning, and these who were not stricken by the first discharge,
                  beheld aghast twelve or fifteen of them stretched on the ground.</p>
               <p>Another volley lessened the number of the survivors.</p>
               <p>Panic-stricken, the only two Americans left unharmed so far—one of whom was Boyce
                  himself—flung themselves into the thicket and, without thinking of choosing any
                  particular direction, rushed through the gloom at that pace assumed by fugitives
                  when they fear the motto is: deuce take the hindmost.</p>
               <p>Joaquin was already having the fire revived, for a dead body or two had the fallen
                  across it and scattered the embers, and was searching for Mr. Boyce as earnestly
                  as Edith looking over the heaps of dead at Hastings for the last of the Saxon
                  kings.</p>
               <p>Jack of the mutilated hand, springing from here to there like a tigress robbed of
                  young, waving his dagger, was pitilessly finishing those of the fallen who still
                  breathed.</p>
               <p>It may or it may not be known to everybody that the death resulting from a bullet
                  gives the corpse extreme pallor.</p>
               <p>The bodies extended on the sward, illumined by the fitful flaring of the fire,
                  presented a sight so hideous and repulsive, especially where widely open eyes
                  seemed to follow you everywhere as in pictures, that the captain could not help a
                  shudder seizing him.</p>
               <p>"If you have searched them all," said he, "let us be off from here. We will camp
                  till morning in a more cheerful place."</p>
               <p>When they settled down for the night in a neighboring spot, making an inroad into
                  the liquors by leave of the leader for rejoicing over the almost perfect triumph,
                  on the principle of double-grog being served out to the tars who have beaten off a
                  pirate, it was found that sleeping would have to be deferred.</p>
               <p>Songs and stories took up the time. One of the latter which was less exceptionable
                  to the others for certain reasons, was as follows:</p>
               <p>"Now, Carillo, for your turn," said the bandits to the one who was lying
                  comfortably on the flat of his back, the smoke of his cigarette curling out of
                  both mouth and nose.</p>
               <p>"I hardly know what to tell. Anyhow, here's the first that comes to mind.</p>
               <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC8324-00000032"/>
               <p>Some time ago, I was at Calaveritas, which, became <emph>warm, in truth,</emph> to
                  me, as you'll see. I had a dispute with a girl, and, forgetting myself, I slapped
                  her in the face. Oh, I know I was wrong, I know one ought never to strike a woman
                  unless it is to strike her dead. But I did it. She left the house with that look
                  in her eye that spoke loud enough. I left directly after her, but she had already
                  given the alarm.</p>
               <p>The whole place was up in arms against me, and I dared not leave it at the time as
                  every Mexican was arrested in the streets and made to give an account of
                  themselves. I was securely hid, though.</p>
               <p>At about four in the morning, I, dreading daylight, determined to attempt a
                  sortie, and I did get out of the village.</p>
               <p>But who should I espy on the road but a line of men, whom I recognized as a lot of
                  simple Dutchmen living thereabouts, whom I had been remarking as they had shown
                  all that greenness a rider of the road liked to meet.</p>
               <p>An idea struck me, and I won't say that the last two or three drinks which I had
                  taken, had nothing to do with making me so daredevilish.</p>
               <p>I had made out to get around them, leading my horse, and might have rode off
                  unchallenged, but, instead of that, I hid my nag in the chapparal, and walked back
                  on the road.</p>
               <p>"Stand still, you! or I shoot you, ——!" said one of the Dutchmen in beautiful
                  English.</p>
               <p>"Up came the rest, surrounding me. As I had calculated, all had the guns which
                  they had brought over from their own land, I suppose, and they were not the men to
                  purchase hundred-dollar Colt's. I laughed to myself. I pretended to fancy them
                  Joaquin's gang, ha, ha! only putting on the broken English."</p>
               <p>"Does I look's if I bees a Woukin?" roars a big paunch, who would make seven of
                  our chief.</p>
               <p>"I let myself be convinced after a while, and on learning that they were waiting
                  for a robber, I offered to stay with them and assist. 'God! didn't I run myself
                  down? I said I knew this Carillo for having taken money out of my pockets at least
                  once—no lie there, amigos! I called myself a great <unclear>rascal, a</unclear>
                  red ball of villainy, a king-pin of wickedness, a knave of the pack of
                     <unclear>thieves</unclear> in a word, I got 'upon an egg' with 'em easily. We
                  drank together of course. Still Carillo did not come. At last, says I, I must be
                  off to town. <unclear>Then</unclear> just as I was going, I added:</p>
               <p>"'I may meet him,' and I stopped. 'Oh, I say, if you hear me fire any where near
                  here, you'll run up and help?'</p>
               <p>"'<unclear>Spalipolersneitchenbangtherrengaunterskinwett</unclear>,' says one.</p>
               <p>"'What?' says I.</p>
               <p>"'Oh, I means to say—yaas, yaas, we will see you all richt, all richt, all richt,'
                  says old capacious fifty times and wagging his head.</p>
               <p>"Off I went towards the town. I wasen't twenty steps off before I set up a
                  shouting and let off two barrels of my revolver. Up rolled the Dutchmen.</p>
               <p>"'There he goes, there, there! fire,' cried I, and expended another charge.</p>
               <p>Bang, bang, bling, bang! went their young cannon of fowling pieces and rifles.</p>
               <p>"'Where is de teef?' roared the head man, blowing the smoke out of his heavy
                  goose-gun.</p>
               <p>"'Here he is,' answered I, covering them with my revolver, 'down with your
                  blunderbusses and shell out.'</p>
               <p>"And so I robbed them every man, and ran up the road. By the time they awoke from
                  the start I gave them, I was half a mile off."</p>

                     AMERICANS, FOUR GERMANS.—FLORESCO PARTS COMPANY NOT EXACTLY AS HE WISHED.—JACK
                     HAS A FEAST.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TWO or three days later, the band paid a visit to the tent of the luckless
                  association who had dropped mining to take up man-hunting. After having attended
                  to the pack-mules and a few remaining horses, they began to search for the gold,
                  and dug up cache'd dust to the value of fourteen thousand dollars. The delighted
                  ravagers retired to Yacqui Camp, which is not far from San Andreas, where they had
                  a retreat.</p>
               <p>On the morning after his arrival there, Joaquin sent of half a dozen of his
                  coyotes under charge of Valenzuela to Arroyo Cantuva with the live stock which
                  could not elsewhere be disposed of, and with greater portion of the gold.</p>
               <p>The residue of the robbers he kept by himself and began a series of ventures
                  against the wayfarer and the wealthy, killing and plundering everybody who came
                  under his hands.</p>
               <p>For many miles around San Andreas and Yacqui Camp, there was nothing talked of but
                  the audacious thefts and murders, and not a soul could tell how they had been
                  committed nor how the stolen goods could be disposed of and not have drawn
                  detection upon the desperado authors.</p>
               <p>Men dotted the roads here and there and yet none, coming up even when the body was
                  warm, had seen the hand that dealt the blow.</p>
               <p>All that was clear was the unpleasant certainty that, like ghosts, bravos and
                  pillagers were stalking among them without being suspected.</p>
               <p>Hence, on every side, men scrutinized their neighbors, though they had known them
                  for months, and people almost drank in the old Danish fashion, knife in hand.</p>
               <p>Captain Ellis, deputy sheriff of the county, mustered a company from among the
                  bold hearts of the San Andreas citizens and, as soon as possible, took up the
                  pursuit of the highwaymen.</p>
               <p>Having learnt by a spy that Joaquin was at Yacqui Camp and that one of his gang
                  was a steady customer at the monte table, he went without loss of time to the
                  designated place, recognized the man of whom he had received the description and
                  arrested him.</p>
               <p>Carillo, for he it was that had been betrayed (some say by that woman whose face
                  he had confessed to have laid his palm upon), was sentenced to receive a short
                  shrift and a long rope instanter, as an assassin and thief, but he was promised
                  pardon if he would reveal the secret of his comrades' refuge.</p>
               <p>The brigand refused disdainfully, but still he consented, for the same reward to
                  help Justice in some other way by which his complicity would not be seen by his
                  mates.</p>
               <p>But, remarking that this proposal was not favorably received, he changed his tone,
                  and in one of bravado, said:</p>
               <p>"Go ahead with your work. If you'll take the trouble," added he, braggingly, "to
                  capture our baggage, you'll find in a valise that belongs to me a dagger which is
                  still encrusted with the blood of a Yankee whom I slew. I should not wonder but
                  that I have settled twenty of you with it. You can only kill me once, that's one
                  good thing!"</p>
               <p>It may easily be supposed that this speech would be replied to only as it
                  deserved. The boaster, without any further ado, was slip-noosed under a tree, the
                  wagon, on which he was made to stand, was driven from under him, and so good bye
                  to another private of Joaquin's ranks.</p>
               <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC8324-00000033"/>
               <p>The associates of Captain Ellis, heeding only their rage, thereupon proceeded with
                  their work, destroying and burning the huts and dens that might serve as lairs to
                  the coyotes.</p>
               <p>The flames shot up from peaks and cast a light over the country as a sort of
                  signal to show how seriously the citizens of San Andreas had taken their share in
                  the matter in hand.</p>
               <p>Joaquin, who was posted with his confederates on a not far distant hill, saw all
                  these proceedings.</p>
               <p>"My men are leaking away, like mercury out of the limestone pores," muttered he.
                  "Bah! See the fires! Whew! if they had hold of us, I would not wonder at all at
                  them roasting us in the innocent brush they are burning up. Poor Carillo! He
                  hasn't been able to shuffle off the coil that twisted his poor neck! No doubt,
                  he's gone to see his old commander Jurata. Caramba! the first twenty English,
                  German, French or Statesmen that I meet shall follow him to hell and pay for my
                  giving them the passage."</p>
               <p>Convinced that Captain Ellis and his company indefatigable as himself, would be
                  scouting all over the country next day, he withdrew to the mountains, his
                  intention being to gain as soon as possible the spot appointed as the main
                  rallying-place, to gather all his men without delay and to give battle to any
                  moderate party of hunters who might follow him too closely.</p>
               <p>As they passed along near the quartz-crushing mill of the Phœnix Company a few
                  miles from the camp, several individuals, entrenched in the building, so to say,
                  poured a volley on the Mexicans, of whom they slightly wounded two.</p>
               <p>On the instant, Joaquin called a halt and returned the fire.</p>
               <p>As the assaillants did not show themselves, he made a charge into the building
                  with Three-fingered Jack and his five or six others.</p>
               <p>They found inside only two men, Americans, who, with that contempt for the
                  "greasers" which resembles the ignorant scorn, far from as well-based, which the
                  John Bulls, entertained in Waterloo days' for the Gaul, valiantly showed an
                  unflinching front to the force thrice their number.</p>
               <p>But in a minute, during which ten or twelve revolver shots were made, they were
                  overpowered.</p>
               <p>Jack dragged them out into the road and did not cease plying his knife until he
                  had shockingly mutilated the corpses. Meanwhile, the leader and his men let off
                  several shots more into different corners of the place, but, not liking the idea
                  of either getting into the loft or descending into the cellar, the entrances of
                  which places one man could defend against at least the first half dozen, they
                  left, and all pursued their route.</p>
               <p>On the other side of Bear Mountain, at which they arrived by a road that follows
                  the San Domingo Creek chain, the Mexicans came upon an encampment of Chinese, on
                  whom they levied to the extent of six or seven hundred dollars, which was all that
                  was owned by the subjects of the Celestial Empire.</p>
               <p>"Not a very rich streak in the <emph>lode,</emph>" joked Jack Three-fingers, who
                  could not refrain from a manifestation of great anxiety on seeing the poor weak
                  wretches.</p>
               <p>So deeply did he interest himself in removing them from misery that he desired to
                  effectually spare them from further pangs of existence; but Joaquin ordered him to
                  ride on and bide time till Americans should be encountered.</p>
               <p>They crossed the river at Forman's Ranch, and followed the highway along the
                  waterside as far as the San Andreas Road.</p>
               <p>About a mile from the town, they made an elbow and ascended an eminence not far
                  from Greaserville.</p>
               <p>On the way, two miners who were traveling on foot, were riddled with bullets and
                  handed over to torturer Jack in such a state that the miscreant, to satisfy his
                  craving for blood, could merely cut their throats and smash in their faces with
                  his riding-boots.</p>
               <p>While going by a creek near Angel Camp, the marauding party entered a tent in
                  which four Germans were sleeping.</p>
               <p>They aroused them and, pistol to ear, steel to throat, forced them to give up all
                  the money and its equivalent that they had in the world, that is a little over two
                  hundred dollars.</p>
               <p>Garcia let his comrades leave without him. When they were a few steps off, he
                  sprang upon the poor fellows and, with one of his most terrific blasphemies, swore
                  that he would cut their hearts out to pay them for not having more money.</p>
               <p>The action would have followed close upon the words had not Joaquin, retracing his
                  steps, interposed and overcome his executioner's intention by saying that he was
                  not going to permit cool butchery.</p>
               <p>It will be remarked that Murieta displayed the temper of fits and starts that his
                  blood is accustomed to evince.</p>
               <p>The monster was compelled thus to give over the pleasure which he had hugged to
                  himself in anticipation; he tried once more, however, to give the troop the slip
                  and turn back, but the commander of the cutthroats had his eyes on him and put a
                  second veto to his motion.</p>
               <p>The late recruit, Floresco, who had been made to stain his hands, had already had
                  some words with his superior.</p>
               <p>"Captain," he had said, during a halt, "I'd like a word with you."</p>
               <p>"Speak away."</p>
               <p>"I bring back the revolver and knife and the honor of belonging to your band which
                  you gave me. I've found out that this bush-fighting don't suit me. I'm too lazy. I
                  think I'll see what t'other life is."</p>
               <p>"All right. You can clear," remarked Joaquin coolly.</p>
               <p>The young fellow was delighted.</p>
               <p>"Captain, you're a regular King of Knaves."</p>
               <p>"So you say."</p>
               <p>"By the bye, about how much does my share amount to in the common bank?"</p>
               <p>"Well, you <emph>had</emph> something like a thousand, I suppose, if the horses
                  are sold."</p>
               <p>"Well, well say a thousand, down."</p>
               <p>"You mistake," said Joaquin, sternly, "I said you had so much, when you belonged
                  to my troop——"</p>
               <p>"What! would you——"</p>
               <p>"Senor Floresco, you came to us empty-handed, I let you go away the same, charging
                  nothing for your keep during the meantime, and you will admit that you lived high,
                  in expectation of dying higher yet. Think yourself lucky that I don't blow out
                  your brains."</p>
               <p>"I'd better stay at the old trade, in that case."</p>
               <p>"I should think so."</p>
               <p>For a while, the would-be deserter had kept quiet; then he had gradually broken
                  out into a strain of mutinous talk which had made the captain watch him
                  attentively. A few days after the last robbery, Floresco had drawn rein while the
                  troop were on the way, and observed firmly that he was not going to ride any
                  farther as he had some particular business which called him back to Yacjin.</p>
               <p>"What business?" inquired the chief.</p>
               <p>"Oh, only a little private matter," answered the other carelessly.</p>
               <p>"I don't doubt that," returned the leader, "but I cannot give you leave at this
                  moment. My design is to unite all the members of my hand at the chief
                  rallying-place, and, unless you give me a good and solid reason, I cannot grant
                  you what you solicit."</p>
               <p>"I did not solicit, I demanded," rejoined the young bandit haughtily.</p>
               <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC8324-00000034"/>
               <p>"Your demand, Senor Floresco, your demand is out of place," sneered the captain,
                  over whose lips passed a faint smile of scorn.</p>
               <p>"Any place or time is good enough for me," said the rebel. "I think this the hour,
                  and this the place when and where I <emph>take</emph> my leave. You don't seem to
                  be in the humor for talking just now, so off I go and put off our discussion till
                  hereafter."</p>
               <p>At the same time, with a wary eye though, he began to wheel his horse, when out
                  came Joaquin's revolver and a command for him to stop.</p>
               <p>"Hold!"</p>
               <p>"Well, what now?" said the bandit, drawing bridle.</p>
               <p>"I think you are a traitor," returned the leader, furious at being so cavalierly
                  treated before several new members of his force; I don't doubt that you're backing
                  out to sell the secrets of our comrades."</p>
               <p>"Oh, think what you like!" answered the rebel, drawing his revolver in a
                  significant manner and meeting his master's eyes with a glance both insolent and
                  threatening.</p>
               <p>"Ha!" exclaimed Joaquin, "by the true and holy cross, you shall have your leave,
                  if only for your impudence."</p>
               <p>At almost the same time, two shots rang out.</p>
               <p>The captain had had all the advantages given by a forestalling in firing, and
                  Floresco, mortally hit, unable to keep foothold in the madrona-wood stirrups,
                  reeled and fell sidewise off the horse.</p>
               <p>The animal, on feeling the reins loosen and the awful bit's spike dropping, sprang
                  away in terror and relief, but, after a plunge or two, let itself be overtaken and
                  led back by one of the band.</p>
               <p>"He's got the <emph>discharge!</emph>" said Garcia, laughing at his own jest.</p>
               <p>All the robbers united in highly blaming the folly and insubordination of
                  Floresco, for, when the innocent do not escape after their death it is not likely
                  the wicked will ever be unspared, and felicitated their superior in so summarily
                  inflicting the lesson.</p>
               <p>"He asked for time and place—I gave him eternity and a grave," observed
                  Joaquin.</p>
               <p>Some two hours after this, as a road was being used which buried itself deeply in
                  the mountain gorges, the troop found itself, in presence of a freshly established
                  camp of five Chinamen.</p>
               <p>Though they were every one armed with knife and Derringer, they made no effort to
                  use them, for either attack or defence, but fell on their knees for life.</p>
               <p>But Floresco's resistance had put this Massaroni of the Mines in no sweet state of
                  mind and he nodded to Three-fingered Jack.</p>
               <p>Without throwing away one minute, the latter flew at the unfortunate wretches and,
                  with flaming eyes and gnashing tooth like a wild beast, he poignarded them
                  successfully.</p>
               <p>While the plunderers of the placers were thus carrying on their detestable calling
                  in the country, with an activity that equalled their audacity, more than once an
                  excitement like to "steamer-day," brought the people upon Montgomery Street to see
                  "Joaquin who had been taken at last!"</p>

                  <p>THE RETIREMENT OF THE RAVAGERS.—A PANTHER HUNT.—THE LOVERS.—ARKANSAW'S LITTLE
                     ARMY.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ON arriving at Arroyo Cantura, the grand master of the marauders was convinced
                  that they had not been inactive; several hundred horses galloped about over the
                  plain, careering in delight at being at liberty.</p>
               <p>Instead of the ordinary rude camp, rose very pretty tents, clustered together into
                  quite a pretty village.</p>
               <p>Grouped around, the brigands were passing the hours in playing cards or dreamily
                  smoking.</p>
               <p>A little way off, on a knoll well carpeted with sward, seated beside their
                  gallants, seven or eight girls, their black eyes glittering, were smiling,
                  laughing, and chatting with the greatest lightness of heart.</p>
               <p>As soon as Joaquin had entered the circle of his followers, compliments and
                  congratulations began to be showered upon him from all sides.</p>
               <p>At the same time the necklace of a woman's arms encircled his neck and the beaming
                  eyes of Clarina welcomed him. Her joy at meeting him again prevented her from
                  uttering a word.</p>
               <p>After his thanks to his confederates, the chief withdrew with his mistress. They
                  sat down under the trees at some distance.</p>
               <p>"Joaquin," murmured the girl, as her magnificent tresses were tossed back from her
                  shoulders and bosom, "you've been so long away that I could not help feeling sad,
                  and fearing the worst. And lonely as I have been, it was dreadful to be thinking,
                  thinking, grieving all the while."</p>
               <p>"Lonely, Clarina? how's that, when here's half a dozen gay ones about you."</p>
               <p>"Alas! it was their very mirth that made me more sorrowful."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! explain yourself! I must know the cause of your moodiness. Weeping? Is
                  the thing so serious as all this?"</p>
               <p>"I am weeping," said she, hiding her face. "I cannot, cannot help my tears
                  flowing—my heart is ready to break. Do you remember your promise? Oh, when will
                  you give up this dangerous and detestable mode of life to return to out dear,
                  beautiful land?"</p>
               <p>"Our land? Oh, would to heaven that I had never left it, I would not be at this
                  moment what I am! But, have courage, Clarina. A few months more, and we will see
                  again the days of our youth. These hours of darkness will float all away."</p>
               <p>A shadow lingered on the girl's face at remembrance of the peaceful past, but as
                  with her truly womanly nature, she loved Murieta in spite of all his crimes, she
                  brightened when she gazed into those eyes which had never lowered before any
                  man's, and met her's now hopefully.</p>
               <p>She found excuse for him in the treatment which he had unjustly met, treatment as
                  bitter as the waters of Laguna Sal.</p>
               <p>She knew most intimately the story of his mind, its sufferings, its yielding to
                  passions and the long course of villainy which had followed the loss of its former
                  purity.</p>
               <p>He had declared to her that he would put an end to his career as soon as his
                  vengeance should be glutted and he should have obtained money equal to what he
                  estimated his losses to be.</p>
               <p>Then, he added, he would retire into Sonora, where he would live in the woods with
                  her.</p>
               <p>She listened to his project with the utmost confidence, for he was sincere in his
                  intentions, and he cared little for whatever the world might think of him,
                  regarding him herself, as was natural, as the handsomest, noblest and most
                  generous of men.</p>
               <p>She was not wise enough to have remarked that the greatest criminals have always
                  foiled their aims by never knowing when to leave off.</p>
               <p>"Are we now near to happiness?" she asked in her sweetest voice.</p>
               <p>"Yes, my love. My vengeance is all but satisfied, and my fortune will be complete
                  when I shall have added a few more thousands to it."</p>
               <p>As he finished these words, illustrative of the pitcher going too often to the
                  well, he was disturbed by one of his men coming up at a gallop to seek him.</p>
               <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC8324-00000035"/>
               <p>What he had to say will be repeated after a few events previously occurring are
                  related.</p>
               <p>One of the bandits, while hunting, had come upon the track of a panther, quite
                  fresh, and he brought the news to camp.</p>
               <p>The rest determined to have some excitement and they entered the woods. For a
                  quarter or half an hour, the bushes were beaten fruitlessly.</p>
               <p>Then, a pistol shot was heard, and all ran in towards the point, greatly
                  contracting the circle.</p>
               <p>The lithe beast had tried to steal past Guerro and Antonio, one of whom had
                  repulsed him with a snap shot, which missed him however.</p>
               <p>The whole ring closed, amid shouting, and the poor animal, more frightened than
                  ferocious, did not know which way to turn.</p>
               <p>He made a couple of rushes but did not dare to receive a volley.</p>
               <p>At last, the continual popping of fire-arms made it desperate and it was seen
                  every now and then leaping up and down in the brush.</p>
               <p>So small was the circle of hunters now that they were nearly in double ranks.</p>
               <p>The critical moment came.</p>
               <p>Creeping forward, belly to ground, and the grass hiding it somewhat, the long,
                  slender body approached one part of the human enclosure.</p>
               <p>A spring placed it on a low-lying oak bough, from which a second leap took it
                  straight at the heads of Garcia and three of his neighbors, who stooped or threw
                  themselves to one side or the other.</p>
               <p>Jack, while falling on his knees, fired two barrels of his revolver at the
                  smooth-skinned form cleaving the air above and by him, and when the brute touched
                  the ground, it tumbled over a bush upon its nose in a confused manner that told of
                  the balls having entered its body. It sought to fly, having had enough of
                  fighting, but a general discharge riddled it from tip of tail to ear, and it
                  rolled over in the wild clover, making the dust fly in its agony. Without waiting
                  to bid his companions stop, Jack jumped upon the body and, avoiding the claws more
                  by good fortune than from any prudence, drove his knife through nerve and bone
                  into one of the glazing eyes. He took good care to jump back at the moment.</p>
               <p>The tortured beast, as if galvanized, bent nearly double, gave a dreadful "lashing
                  out" like a vicious horse with the powerful hind feet, and, gnashing its teeth,
                  rolled over and over like a cat in a fit.</p>
               <p>At last, the paroxysm died away, and the carcase lay motionless, with stiffening
                  limbs and exposed teeth.</p>
               <p>"The skin is almost too much riddled to be of any good," remarked Valenzuela, as
                  he saw Garcia plying his knife in flaying the warm body.</p>
               <p>"I only want some strips of skin—hello!" exclaimed Jack interrupting himself, and
                  suddenly quitting his stripping off the hide to dig into the belly with his blade.
                  "Boys, scatter and find a fresh trail—here's half a ramrod of a gun, and none of
                  us carried any."</p>
               <p>"None," said Garcia, "but are you sure it ain't an old wound?"</p>
               <p>"Why, nothing could live long with so much in them—four inches of hickory and an
                  iron top," said Jack, holding up the unusual projectile. "No wonder the panther
                  fought shy of us. She was only recovering from a hurt."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, I see."</p>
               <p>They let the chase of animals go for that of the suspected man or men. At length,
                  about a mile from Cantura Creek, one of the out-lying scouts struck a quite fresh
                  trail, made by no less than twelve or fifteen men.</p>
               <p>This was the intelligence which had been brought to the leader.</p>
               <p>It was important to give no stranger time to leave the valley after having been so
                  near to the bandits' den as to have divined their proximity, else they must have
                  been blind fellows not to be supposed to have taken to desert life.</p>
               <p>Such an event as the secret being spread was defeat to the Mexican chief's plans,
                  at the same time as compelling him to change the head-quarters of his band.</p>
               <p>Choosing without delay one of his best mounts, Joaquin started off, accompanied by
                  twenty selected bravoes, foremost among whom were his usual right-hand men
                  Three-fingered Jack and Valenzuela, the no less brave and faithful Guerra, Antonio
                  and Fernando.</p>
               <p>This detachment followed the discovered track at a "pressing pace," as the
                  language of the turf goes, for a couple of hours, when there suddenly appeared
                  before them eight or nine Americans, who were holding in their horses, waiting
                  carelessly for them to come on.</p>
               <p>They hesitated for an instant, slackened their pace and halted at a dozen yards'
                  distance.</p>
               <p>Joaquin had remarked that one of the strangers was the miner who had tried to
                  arrest him in a gambling saloon of Sonora.</p>
               <p>"What brings you into this valley?" challenged the captain of banditti, pushing on
                  for a horse's length further to better see that man's features and make sure of
                  his belief.</p>
               <p>The leader of the party hesitated.</p>
               <p>Now Arkansaw (as the man was nick-named, who had failed to take Joaquin) had been
                  so tormented by the rough jokers for his miss, that he had made up his mind that
                  he would endeavor once more to make his word true.</p>
               <p>He found a difficulty in getting as many men as he required, and, with one or two
                  friends who did stand by him, he joined a company of twelve formed by the present
                  leader, a New Englander whose speculative turn had seen a fair chance in the high
                  rewards out for the Mexican brigand, and off they had gone.</p>
               <p>He had formed the idea that the chief was a dare-devil enough, but that his
                  supporters were a cowardly crew of cutthroats, who were nothing except he inspired
                  them.</p>
               <p>But the sudden appearance of Joaquin at the head of a score of men well-equipped,
                  well-mounted and armed, all ugly-looking desperadoes, threw the speculator on
                  banditti stock all aback, and he, though brave enough, too, would have liked to
                  have steered one way or another or gone about altogether with every stitch of sail
                  out alow, aloft and on studding-sail-booms, at the bold challenge.</p>
               <p>He had such a vein of circumspection within him, that he felt sure nothing was to
                  be gained by fighting unless a bullet or a knife-blade is a benefit.</p>
               <p>So he kept silent.</p>
               <p>Joaquin grew more and more impatient, and cried in a tone no sweeter than his
                  former speech was couched in:</p>
               <p>"Did you hear me, or must I explain myself more clearly?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I heard," answered the Yankee, as he took a quarter of a fresh plug as a
                  chew, and glanced around on his associates as if to ask them what should be
                  done.</p>
               <p>"Then, what do you say? Quick? Who are you, and what in the name of hoof and horns
                  fetches you into this valley?"</p>
               <p>"Hold on, <emph>stranger,</emph> no hurry," replied the other, who had
                  "calculated" on his best course. "Give a man time to turn over what you say. You
                  don't seem to be half-civilized by the way you hurry up the cakes. Let the water
                  fill the sluice, can't you? To say something, though, and give you a lesson in
                  politeness, our presence in this district of which you seem to be the selectmen,
                  is because we are a band of hunters after game. If you don't want to pick a muss,
                  we won't disturb <emph>you!</emph> There! what do——"</p>
               <p>At these words, which the hardy members of this prudent general's army heard in
                  disgust, surprise and scorn appeared on their bronzed phizes.</p>
               <p>Several dull growls had already been audible, like the warning voices around Cape
                  Mendocino.</p>
               <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC8324-00000036"/>
               <p>With a curse, Arkansaw put his horse in advance of the speaker's.</p>
               <p>"Boys, I'm cap., now, eh?"</p>
               <p>"You, yes! sail in! To h—with <emph>him!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"I'm sure I know you!" cried Arkansaw, charging Joaquin. "You are——Crack—ack—ack!

                  <p>THE HAND-TO-HAND TUSSLE.—ARKANSAW AND THREE-FINGERS.—ESCAPE OF THE
                     AMERICAN.—THE ARROYO DESERTED.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>RANG—blang, blang! went the reply fire, while a chorus of hostile cries rent the
                  smoke.</p>
               <p>Joaquin's first barrel sent its missile close to the on-coming Arkansaw, but it
                  slew, not him, but the Yankee whose place the bolder man had assumed.</p>
               <p>The chief received a wound on the left shoulder, which a side-turn in his saddle
                  had only kept from his throat.</p>
               <p>All were mingled in a general confusion. Five of Joaquin's men had lost their
                  seats never to move again, two of the opponents, beside the speculative, deposed
                  leader, had fallen under the combatants' feet like them, but all the wounded were
                  fighting on.</p>
               <p>The Americans, who suffered the most from pistol-shots, did all they could to
                  close in, and butt-ends of firearms and knives were principally employed.</p>
               <p>Through the medley of oaths, groans, shouts and detonations, were to be heard the
                  voices of the leaders, encouraging and urging them on, while fighting themselves
                  most vigorously, the Mexican like a puma, the other like a grizzly.</p>
               <p>Wounded and bleeding, but as brave and bold as over, Murieta ran his horse hither
                  and thither through the tangled mass, and showed himself everywhere at the points
                  where the result was wavering, deciding victory often by his simple coming.</p>
               <p>The attacking party fought a little despairingly now. For a moment, they had held
                  the advantage over their antagonists, and they would have kept it, only for the
                  unseen devil that seemed to continually attend the bandit chief, and overcome the
                  foeman's courage and vigor.</p>
               <p>After having emptied his revolver on the enemy, Three-fingered Jack had flung the
                  weapon into the nearest face, and with his usual ferocity, had begun plunging
                  about with his poignard right and left, and before him, so blindly that at times
                  he had wounded his own comrades and their horses.</p>
               <p>When Joaquin, after having unhorsed one of the most prominent of the assailants,
                  could survey the scene of action more calmly, he saw that nine of his men were
                  doubtlessly the same number of trodden corpses that strewed the ground. All the
                  others except one were sleeping in death beside them.</p>
               <p>The sole survivor, of whom we speak, was the robust giant Arkansaw, who was
                  stoutly giving Three-fingered Jack all he wanted, each with a knife in hand.</p>
               <p>The first, no doubt having had great experience in the steel, was indeed, raining
                  more stabs and cuts than he had to parry, which contributed not a little towards
                  augmenting the rage of Garcia.</p>
               <p>Joaquin and the rest of the band, except such as had wounds to staunch, glad of a
                  rest and a treat at the same time, sat their horses, tranquil spectators of the
                  struggle, confident as they were of the issue from their knowledge of their
                  comrade's powers and address.</p>
               <p>Now reining in, now letting slip, now wheeling, then lifting their foam-flecked
                  horses, whose jaws ran blood and their neck and fore-shoulders as well from
                  mis-directed blows the two champions crashed their blades triflingly, so to say
                  waiting to deal the mortal, finishing stroke.</p>
               <p>"You jes' give fair play a leetle longer," muttered Arkansaw, "that's all!"</p>
               <p>Jack swore all the time, and roared a tremendous execration at length when he
                  fancied that he had got the opening that he so much desired.</p>
               <p>He gave a short, quick thrust, as if he had held a sword, drew back, changed his
                  grasp on the bloody handle and delivered a dreadful downward darting of his knife
                  which, splendidly warded off by the bowie, which made the thinner stiletto bend,
                  ripped up the thigh of Arkansaw.</p>
               <p>On this cruel wound, and feeling that indescribable sensation of hot blood
                  scalding the gash it boils through, the latter so dextrously glided his arm under
                  the other's that the broad blade, prevented from penetrating the eye by a miracle,
                  laid bare the top of the Mexican's cheek-bone and left a clean cut from there down
                  the cheek to the very edge of the lower jaw-bone; had the mouth been open, the
                  cheek would have been perforated.</p>
               <p>Garcia, whose set teeth ground in agony at the awful pain when the bone was
                  scraped, all but yelled, and swayed in the saddle. His horse fell back, just as
                  Arkansaw made a second sweeping stroke.</p>
               <p>The Mexicans, alarmed, hastened to the succor of their comrade, but he, recovering
                  himself, forced them to stand off with horrid imprecations. They obeyed but it was
                  plainly to be seen that they were eager to finish the American, if he continued to
                  conquer.</p>
               <p>Arkansaw felt clearly that, do his utmost, yet he could gain nothing by continuing
                  to fight, so—only waiting to catch one of Jack's stabs on his left arm, and to
                  make a return—he lifted his horse round on its hind legs and pricked him on into a
                  flight swift as lightning. His savage antagonist, as well as Joaquin, followed him
                  at a distance.</p>
               <p>For five miles, the chase went on, Joaquin remaining a little behind Garcia, who
                  nearly touched the fugitive every time he made a "burst." Thus forcing the pace,
                  he often got so near that he lifted his dagger, but at that instant, the American
                  would compel his steed to make a "spurt," and down would drop the steel powerless.
                  Jack swore continually and louder and loudly as he felt his mount failing him.</p>
               <p>The chief, who had taken much out of his charger by his plunging about the
                  battle-field, was dropped behind considerably, and, when he had been within
                  pistol-range, Three-fingered Jack's motions in the saddle had prevented him
                  risking a shot. Jack had no fire-arms.</p>
               <p>Arkansaw showed himself to be a consummate rough-rider, and he had that art,
                  little cultivated, of conversing with his horse as though he were a man. He would
                  tell him of the impediments in the way, of the nature of the ground, of the state
                  of the pursuing party, promise him food in profusion, laugh to him, chide him, pat
                  him, smooth his mane, and whisper hopeful words in his turned-back ears, to which
                  he was bowed forward. Whether it affected the animal or not, it at least pleases
                  the rider.</p>
               <p>"Good old nag," said Arkansaw, at length, after a glance over his shoulder
                  "they're no where, my boy!"</p>
               <p>He laughed, and the horse stretched out in a greyhound's leap, as if new powers
                  had been given him.</p>
               <p>In fact, convinced that, from some cause or other, the fugitive was getting more
                  out of his horse than they out of theirs, which might be foundered if the chase
                  was prolonged, Joaquin called off his hound, and the two baffled bandits walked
                  their horses back to their confederates. The wounded were still there, under care
                  of some of their comrades, who understood a little of the healing art.</p>
               <p>Fernando Fontes and another had received such wounds that they lingered on only
                  till the morrow, their deaths bringing the whole loss to eleven.</p>
               <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC8324-00000037"/>
               <p>The chief though he was not hurt in a very serious manner, had lost much blood,
                  and he was obliged to keep quiet for several days, and receive such attentions as
                  were lavished upon him by the loving Clarina.</p>
               <p>Antonio and Guerra, no less lucky than their commander, found in the tender
                  solicitude of their inamoratas relief to their sufferings; hence, these three were
                  set a field anew at the time when their less-favored companions were just coming
                  round.</p>
               <p>Murieta could not help feeling some uneasiness at the recollection of the sturdy
                  survivor of the American party.</p>
               <p>He reproached himself for ever having given him the chance to make off, when a
                  dozen bullets might have been bestowed upon him during his conflict with
                  Three-fingered Jack.</p>
               <p>A fortnight had already elapsed since the bloody skirmish and, if the escaped man
                  had not died of his wounds there was everything to lead one to believe that he
                  would raise a body of adventurers, there being many hangers-on about the diggings
                  who would ask nothing better than such "sport."</p>
               <p>At all events, the story he had to tell would have its effect on the various bands
                  resting on their arms, which were ready to rise against the ravagers at the first
                  report of his whereabouts.</p>
               <p>Arkansaw would probably offer himself as guide to such.</p>
               <p>In the dread of such an event, Joaquin resolved to abandon for the present at
                  least the asylum on which he had set his choice.</p>
               <p>By this means, he thought to deceive the seekers, who, on arriving and finding the
                  valley untenanted, would imagine that the banditti had retired into Mexico, or
                  else they would divide into smaller detachments in their scouting, when, each of
                  them might be attracted into defiles and passes in the mountains and there
                  destroyed, at the cost, to his hidden, securely-posted men, of scarcely one.</p>
               <p>In this design everything was got ready for the departure.</p>
               <p>The horses, which amounted to several hundreds, were formed into manageable droves
                  and started for Mexico under guard of four of the best vaqueroes of the band. The
                  tents were taken down and packed upon the mules, as well as everything around the
                  camping-ground which could be of any use.</p>
               <p>The women attired themselves in their masculine traveling-habits and prepared
                  bravely and gaily to cross highlands and low, dark gorges and sunlit peaks; there
                  were not only privations and fatigues to be resisted, but, at any moment, from the
                  craggy wall at whose foot they trailed along, might spring out or roll down the
                  treacherous American lion or the grizzly bear.</p>
               <p>Those of the wounded in that late encounter where the fallen Americans had sold
                  their lives dearly, who had not yet been restored to strength, were placed on the
                  easiest goers in the cavalcade, which had been previously used by the women.</p>
               <p>The patient being seated on comfortable Mexican saddles, as large almost as an
                  elephant's howdah, were for the more precaution, attached to them by straps, and
                  had a free rider leading them.</p>
               <p>Thus, the robbers streamed out of the valley, a long line of a hundred and six men
                  and nine females.</p>
               <p>It was not without regret that farewell was said to the magnificent retreat, so
                  wild and desolate-looking of a sudden, which had lately been witness of their
                  rejoicings, pleasures and repose.</p>
               <p>At the head of the column, rode Joaquin, surrounded, like a Napoleon of marauders,
                  by his marshals, by his lieutenants.</p>
               <p>His handsome features wore an expression of sadness and gravity, as he explained
                  to his companions the reasons which had led him to quit Arroyc Cantuva, a kind of
                  another unconsumed Moscow.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>THE JOURNEY.—THE NEW HEAD-QUARTERS.—THE PLAN.—REPULSED AT THE RANCH.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE journey did not suffice to distract the captain of banditti from his constant
                  reveries. The memory of his last affair with the party of self-appointed police,
                  still tortured his mind; though it had been almost completely defeated,
                  nevertheless he had paid very dear for an unconsiderable victory, and was
                  compelled to acknowledge the powerlessness of his men at close-quarters with the
                  brave by intelligence men of the superior race.</p>
               <p>He regretted that the whole of his troop was not composed of individuals as active
                  and fearless as Three-fingered Jack, Valenzuela, Antonio and Guerra.</p>
               <p>Enraged at having let Arkansaw escape, he was compelled to admit as well that the
                  redoubtable Garcia was neither invulnerable nor successful all the time and that
                  he was no longer the Inconquerable of other days.</p>
               <p>He was the strongest, the cruelest, the most cunning and resolute of all his
                  cutthroats; he had been whilom the favorite, the right hand man of Jurata the
                  famous guerrilla; moreover, he was wonderfully assisted by a long experience,
                  carrying on his body scars of many wounds received in numberless actions.</p>
               <p>If this champion had come off only second-best in a fight with Arkansaw, no
                  wonderful man, would the rest of the gang be well off when pitted against fellows
                  of that stripe. It was not probable.</p>
               <p>Joaquin was sure that his interest enforced his avoiding any heavy contest with
                  the followers of justice, regulars or irregulars.</p>
               <p>A combat of this nature, even admitting the result to be fortunate to him, would
                  deprive him of a number of his foremost men, not to be replaced without time and
                  difficulty, which would be a serious obstacle to the carrying out of projects
                  which he had formed at the setting out on his marauding career.</p>
               <p>These reflections, and many others springing from them, greatly clouded Murieta's
                  brow; for the first time he experienced a sharp and weighty desire of flinging to
                  the winds and waters the guilty existence which he had hitherto led, to withdraw
                  into his native country with his well-loved Clarina.</p>
               <p>The latter, meanwhile traveling in the rear of the main body, surrounded by the
                  associates of her own sex who were not at all affected by any forebodings, was
                  yielding to impressions quite the opposite to those which swayed her lover; she
                  was as merry and laughing as could well be.</p>
               <p>She was amusing herself perforce and vying with her companions in a kind of
                  pastime in which the victor was the one who was most mirthful.</p>
               <p>The countless echoes which were bandied back from either enclosing line of rocky
                  steeps, repeated their songs and peals of merriment, until it might have been
                  believed that it was a virgin forest of the tropics full of bright birds with
                  melodious throat.</p>
               <p>After having traversed the rich hollows which extend northward of Tulare Lake, the
                  Mexicans crossed the San Joaquin River some twelve miles from Fort Miller, and
                  pushed on towards the north-east as far as the falls of the Yohamite.</p>
               <p>Thence, passing the stream again, they worked toilsomely up the Sierra Nevada,
                  then down into the pleasant, the delightful, the tempting valleys on the other
                  side and at length reached the mountains on the east of Lake Mono.</p>
               <p>In their gullies, clefts and passes, the outlaw, at the commencement of his
                  adventures, had found shelter from some volunteer constables who had chased him
                  and his then insignificant allies from Hangtown to Castle Peak, not far from the
                  Sonora Pass. Since then he had always looked upon this spot as the best and surest
                  hiding-place in the whole State.</p>
               <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC8324-00000038"/>
               <p>The chief took the lead through a narrow path which would have been past suspicion
                  so completely had nature taken pains to dissimulate it by means of precipitous
                  rocks and super-abundance of vegetation, and when they had entered by it, they
                  were in as retired and picturesque a site as they could have fancied. It is a mere
                  cleft in the heights about five-and-twenty miles to the south-east of Lake Mono,
                  between two rugged walls, crested by masses of stone and earth toppling over as if
                  to fall.</p>
               <p>If these sides of the narrow way were climbed, the country could be surveyed for
                  miles around. In this wild place, near a region well stocked, if the term will
                  pass, with red, gray and desert foxes, coyotes, wolves, and grizzlies, the robbers
                  pitched their tents.</p>
               <p>The shades of evening were already stealing over the sky and earth, all around
                  seemed to invite to repose the adventurers, who were temporarily cut of the reach
                  of their sea of troubles.</p>
               <p>On the perfumed sward of mingled grass and moss, in their ample blankets, they
                  slumbered until morning, with not one guard a-foot, they sleep no less peaceful
                  and deep than that of men whose hands had never been imbrued in blood, whose
                  hearts had never been darkened by even the idea of a criminal desire!</p>
               <p>But it was the wearisome journey which fear of merited judgment had impelled that
                  had alone given them this short stay of punishment.</p>
               <p>The most hardened feel pangs of which an honest man never can dream of, far beyond
                  any of his earthly inflictions.</p>
               <p>On the morrow, the outlaw assembled all about him and laid out before them his
                  plans and ideas as to the future.</p>
               <p>"You know," he began, "that we count one hundred in active service. Our spies,
                  friends and associates, scattered all over in almost all the towns and camps of
                  the state, are nearly four hundred. These allies can only aid us verbally, I mean
                  by information which they procure for us; they cannot lend us any open assistance
                  for reasons which it is useless to explain to you just now. I hold insecure places
                  considerable sums, and my intention is to raise from Sonora and Lower California a
                  certain number of recruits who will bring our forces in the field to three
                  hundred.</p>
               <p>"I will equip and arm these new hands and will begin a sweeping business in the
                  southern counties. I will destroy the Yankees by wholesale, burn their farms,
                  overrun their property, and do it all so rapidly that they shall not have time to
                  collect troops and organize resistance. By the time they are sufficiently powerful
                  to fetter my further movements, I will have finished my task and sought shelter in
                  some of the Sonorian sierras. When there, I will give goodbye to the life of
                  roving and adventures which we have led together up till now. In this way,
                  friends, will we have taken vengeance for the evil done to us and some overplus
                  for the wrongs which the Yankees, during the last war, wreaked upon our
                  unfortunate country. We will do our share towards wiping out the cursed race, just
                  as they have destroyed the buckeye-nut eaters. We will divide the spoil of the
                  expeditions, and let the rest of our days roll on in peace."</p>
               <p>"Long life to the noble captain!" cried every man long and loudly.</p>
               <p>Enthusiasm kindled every eye.</p>
               <p>The splendid picture which had been enrolled before them was so dazzling, the
                  design displayed so unexpected, that the bandits could scarcely contain their
                  joy.</p>
               <p>Although they had always loved and admired their superior throughout all the
                  phases of his dangerous existence, none of them had given him credit for what they
                  esteemed as genius discovered in his projects.</p>
               <p>His speech electrified them with fresh energy and more than ever were they eager
                  to follow and obey him, come what might.</p>
               <p>That same day, Joaquin told off eight companies of ten men each towards different
                  parts of the state, to the east, south and north, with the express order to
                  procure money and horses with all their might and main.</p>
               <p>He himself remained at the rendezvous with twenty-five, whose only occupation was
                  the killing of game, and watching over the horses and weapons. Few days passed
                  since the departure of the little divisions in which interval, the wounded had
                  recovered.</p>
               <p>Joaquin, seeing all he had in an efficient state, took with him Valenzuela and
                  Three-fingered Jack and a select party, and went off on a scout and for any
                  enterprise that offered.</p>
               <p>Antonio, Guerro and the remainder were to protect the camp and the women from the
                  roamings of the wild beasts which had not quitted the neighborhood despite the
                  successive hunts which had been made upon them and the unpleasant acquaintance
                  many of them had made with the firearms and steel of the band.</p>
               <p>On arriving at Fiddletown, Joaquin met the captain of one of the troops, who had a
                  bag of gold coin to give him and a bit of news which gave the direction to the
                  leader's move.</p>
               <p>Darkness had stolen upon Jackson, but not so deeply as to prevent a dim pleasantly
                  vague view of the town and its surroundings.</p>
               <p>A ranch, which an American named Fairgrove had purchased years before and since
                  enlarged into a double house of two stories in height, occupied by him, his wife
                  and a widowed sister and two of her children, (a girl, with whom we have little to
                  do, and a boy of fourteen), sat upon the side of a gentle acclivity about a mile
                  from the town, and a quarter of a mile from the road.</p>
               <p>Down to the road, from the front of the house, the ground was almost all wooded;
                  behind and in the valley it was under cultivation, and the products brought "gold"
                  prices from the mining population.</p>
               <p>Now, Fairgrove, who had been twice a loser of several valuable horses, no doubt
                  through Joaquin's band, had tried to take his revenge by doing all he could to
                  have that robber taken, and half a dozen times, when applied to, he had loaned
                  horses to suddenly-organized constabulary forces.</p>
               <p>He had made himself prematurely old by abuse of liquors, and was prevented going
                  out thief-hunting himself, or he would surely have been at the head of a
                  party.</p>
               <p>Rumor had it that the marauders had turned up in those parts once again, and, as
                  ill luck would have it, a most powerful and valiant dog which belonged to his
                  ranch had been shot accidentally by Fairgrove's young nephew, who was practising
                  at a mark as a study, as in more peaceful countries, he would have had Latin, or
                  French, or book-keeping or what you will to do.</p>
               <p>The animal had not been killed, but to shorten his agony a finishing stroke had
                  been dealt him. For two days, Mr. Fairgrove had been going to town to buy a
                  guardian to replace the lost one, but he was of an easy nature.</p>
               <p>As the requirement was one in which the women folks had interested themselves, for
                  they drank in greedily all the outrageous stories of the exploits of the
                  celebrated bandit, the ranchero had yielded at last to the dropping fire, but
                  continual, and rode over to Jackson to make the purchase.</p>
               <p>This was at noonday.</p>
               <p>He dined with a friend and took a stroll about the town to see the new buildings
                  run up since his last visit.</p>
               <p>It chanced that a company in which his companion was concerned had the great good
                  fortune to turn up a large nugget, which led to a general rejoicing by all
                  concerned.</p>
               <p>You could not rejoice in California without the very natural concomitant, a<pb
                     n="74-75" xml:id="VAC8324-00000039"/> punishing of the "Oh, be joyful!" Mr.
                  Fairgrove had hardly returned to his friend's abode than he laid down to rest.</p>
               <p>He was aroused at twilight for supper.</p>
               <p>"Had supper-time come? Good heavens! whew! won't they haul me over the coals, at
                  home! I will take a taste of that brandy just up from 'Frisco, and must be off.
                  Oh, I ain't afraid on the road, pooh! tush! bah!"</p>
               <p>And off rode Fairgrove at full speed. As a speedy arrival was his only wish
                  for—though, of course, the non-prosecution of the canine demand would still be a
                  great grievance against him—if he should not be home, he knew how his family would
                  cry out against having been left for one whole night with only a lad of fourteen
                  in the house, for the stable-men and farm-hands lived in buildings two hundred
                  feet and more from it—as a speedy arrival lay closest to his heart, he not only
                  spurred on at his fastest, but struck off from the road across a neighbor's land
                  and entered his estate by the valley.</p>
               <p>The remaining effect of his libations, not altogether slept off, prompted him to
                  attempt a little innocent practical joke.</p>
               <p>He let his horse loose, and, hiding the harness in a bush, crept under cover up
                  towards his house.</p>
               <p>He was already chuckling at the fanciful picture which he drew of how he would be
                  mistaken for a robber, and how all would end in laughter, so hearty as to cover
                  his sin of omission.</p>
               <p>All at once he stopped.</p>
               <p>Two of his men had come out of the stable. Two of <emph>his</emph> men—no, good
                  God, no!</p>
               <p>This couple were sheathing knives and were stealing along towards the house.</p>
               <p>The fumes of liquor yet clouding the watcher's mind vanished at this appeal to his
                  affection and to his fears.</p>
               <p>This couple were assassins, and all the workmen had been murdered, beyond a
                  doubt!</p>
               <p>He griped his revolver nervously and inspected the nipples; all the caps were
                  on.</p>
               <p>The two men had crept up under the extensive verandah, piazza, ground-floor
                  balcony, or whatever you like to style it, which ran around the whole
                  building.</p>
               <p>Fairgrove braced himself ready to run up and slay one or both before they should
                  make an entrance, but neither climbed over the railing but crouched down and
                  glided under the stoop, after cleverly and noiselessly ripping off a board.</p>
               <p>There was a hollow space under the verandah of many feet long and wide, and three
                  feet high.</p>
               <p>As if their disappearance were a signal, two other men appeared over by the
                  out-houses, and carefully made the same transit, burying themselves in the same
                  way.</p>
               <p>Two more couples, and at last one man.</p>
               <p>All was still, and Fairgrove might have doubted his vision, especially as the
                  displaced plank had been fitted in again.</p>
               <p>What pained him more, so poignant was the proof of his family utterly unsuspecting
                  the impending fate, was that there came faintly to him, a snatch of a song or a
                  light laugh, which were uttered by his young niece.</p>
               <p>He thought for a moment of rushing to the house and standing before the opening,
                  prevent the thieves from the movement until assistance should have come. But he
                  remembered that window only rudely boarded over, opened from the cellar into under
                  the piazza, and he was quite confident that the concealed villains had already
                  discovered it.</p>
               <p>His men being all disposed of, no assistance was about the premises.</p>
               <p>He could delay, but not prevent the murder of his family and the cleaning out of
                  his house. He took the course which was hardest and might or not be the best.</p>
               <p>He could only go mad if they should all be slain in his absence!</p>
               <p>He never could tell how he hastened back to where he had turned his horse a drift,
                  found him, caught him, bridled and saddled him, and dashed off, more directed by
                  instinct than by calculation.</p>
               <p>All he knew he reached the nearest neighbor's house after an hour's maddening
                  ride, and burst in upon the supper-table with the wild, crazy cry:</p>
               <p>"Haste! If it is not till all are asleep that they are waiting, good bye to
                  them!"</p>
               <p>The moment he grew cooler and told all, the friend roused the household, and set
                  off back with him, sending one of his sons to town and another to the nearest
                  miners' camp, which was on the road. As these latter would have the road to
                  travel, they would probably reach the scene before the others, who had almost
                  unbroken country to cross. If their signal should not be answered, they were to
                  wait, unless, of course, something was occurring in or about Fairgrove's
                  house.</p>
               <p>It was Joaquin's men, under command of Garcia, who had made the descent on the
                  ranch of Fairgrove. They had heard of the dog's death and, as they were all the
                  more sure of success from that fact, which promised more likelihood of a perfect
                  surprise, they had began as we have seen Fairgrove suspect, that is: had mastered
                  the tenants of the out-buildings just at the moment of their entering their
                  dwellings at dusk.</p>
               <p>Masters were not very exacting when a harsh word or a cross look would often send
                  a man off to the digging, whose place it would perhaps be impossible to fill at
                  the most exorbitant of wages. Hence the short hours of labor.</p>
               <p>Garcia had wanted to begin the proposed butchery at once, but Valenzuela, who was
                  second, had persuaded him that it would be better to wait until eight or nine,
                  when all would be asleep throughout the house. They did not know that the master
                  was away, and gave the lad of fourteen credit for more prowess than he perhaps
                  possessed.</p>
               <p>Perhaps, you will wonder why the robbers did not charge without delay, as here
                  were only two males against their eight or nine.</p>
               <p>Yes, but these fellows had found by sad experience that the few women who were
                  blessing the rude state then were, if beautiful ancestresses of the fair daughters
                  of El Dorado's brilliant to-day, made braver yet by the encompassing perils of
                  exposed life and were seldom so unluckily gifted with stupid relations as not to
                  be compelled to learn to put an half-ounce of lead into the bull's eye "plum
                  center" at a reasonable distance. All of which Amazonian discipline was
                  accomplished at no expense of modesty, a fact which women who have had their own
                  honor and dear ones to defend will understand, if our other readers do not.</p>
               <p>All this time, frightening themselves for nothing, without dreaming of there
                  really being great foundation for their fears, the females were supping uneasily
                  and almost afraid to retire to rest. The chamber they occupied, for they would not
                  leave one another, was on that side where were concealed the thieves. The servant
                  and the children were in the other part.</p>
               <p>The miners, who had been found at their encampment by the messenger, had instantly
                  responded to the call, and, on horses or pack-mules, as the case might be, they
                  had dashed along the road, only dismounting at the entrance to Fairgrove's ranch.
                  Thence they ran along quietly but quickly. When they came in sight of the house,
                  they twittered out the signal, an imitation of a bird. No response, so they
                  waited. But very restlessly though, for they started at every noise.</p>
               <p>At last, though only a few moments had passed, and one or two lights showed yet in
                  the house, it was deemed best to forestall the bandits' moves.<pb n="76-77"
                     xml:id="VAC8324-00000040"/> They left the shadow of the trees and proceeded
                  along the side of the house in hopes of surprising the enemy, when a loud scream
                  inside was followed by a hammering as of a pistol butt on a door, and that by a
                  shot.</p>
               <p>At the same time that the miners raised a cheer to appal the assailants and to
                  encourage our friends, another shout joined in with theirs, and a number of men
                  appeared on their right speeding toward the house like themselves. Both parties of
                  rescuers were on hand; not too early either.</p>
               <p>One smashed in the piazza windows in front, the other forced a back window, and
                  four or five daring men boldly penetrated the empty space under the verandah and
                  went through the window into the cellar, which had been opened.</p>
               <p>Some time before this, the women had consulted together on their heartlessness in
                  leaving the young girl, the servant and the youth so far away. They resolved to
                  have them come over to their part of the house, the females to stay with them, the
                  lad to occupy the adjoining room. After a delay, Mrs. Fairgrove's sister-in-law
                  valorously determined on executing the delivery of the desire, and on passing
                  along down stairs, across the main room and up stairs, again alone, and in the
                  dark, for she preferred, with another feminine trait, not to have a chance of
                  seeing what she dreaded. With prudent preparation, she took off all her jewelry
                  and put it in her pockets, winding her handkerchief round all to prevent jingling,
                  had removed everything light-colored from her dress, which was deep mourning,
                  fortunately. She went in her stocking feet. She left the revolver they had with
                  her sister, gave her final directions and slipped out of the narrowly-opened
                  door.</p>
               <p>She descended untouched and entered the main room; as she did so, she heard on the
                  other side the words, very faint:</p>
               <p>"She! back!"</p>
               <p>She went on, feeling for the chairs and table, and, for an instant, did not glance
                  thitherward. When she did, she thought she saw that the door, which led to an
                  entry and by that to the cellar, was not quite closed and she doubted not that a
                  white dot she noted about four feet from the floor was a finger holding it ajar.
                  The person, if there was one, had been about to enter when she, or something else,
                  had alarmed him.</p>
               <p>This was one of those moments when everything depended on taking the proper course
                  out of half a dozen. If she continued her way, their return with the children
                  would be intercepted beyond doubt. If she flew back to her sister, the house was
                  divided, and each would hear the death-struggle of the other.</p>
               <p>Like lightning, she sprang to the door and threw her whole weight against it. A
                  deep, though not loud, exclamation of acute pain told her that the strange sound
                  she heard was the snapping of that finger-bone! The door would not shut. Had it
                  been farther open, it would have severed the finger; it crushed it, and tore off
                  the flesh of one of the bandits, as it was. She dragged the table to her and
                  jammed it against the door, closing fully now, and bolted hurriedly. The key was
                  gone, lost long ago during non-usage. Like one inspired she heaped up chairs and
                  everything within reach to add to the barricade.</p>
               <p>Pistols, bullets, and knife-handles began to hammer at the upper panels, while
                  kicks rained on the lower ones. A dreadful pressure was exerted against it. The
                  bolt started, and was bent out of the loosened sockets. It gave way! For a moment
                  only, for, as fortune would have it, a tipped-up chair caught the lock with its
                  back, while its hind legs held on the floor, and no force except that which would
                  drive all before it, could open that door now. Still throwing on the furniture
                  with frenzied hands, the woman worked. The robbers thought the hindrance was the
                  lock, so a pistol was clapped to the keyhole and fired. Exhausted, for the
                  paroxysm was over, the woman fell as if she had been shot and swooned on the
                  carpet, fortunately for her. Her sister, at the report, screamed from upstairs.
                  The robbers, united in one grand push, burst the door in at the hinges and tumbled
                  over the awkward pile.</p>
               <p>While hesitating which way to go, the cheers outside started them.</p>
               <p>"Fire the house!" growled Garcia.</p>
               <p>"No, no, no delay," cried another. "Back!"</p>
               <p>The rearmost turned and went down the stairs, but were received, after a hail to
                  which they made no reply from confusion, with a volley. They returned in quick
                  time.</p>
               <p>"Come on, all's up!" said Valenzuela; "follow me. We must save ourselves for the
                  captain."</p>
               <p>The shivering of glass of the piazza windows turned them from the front, a similar
                  sound warned them that the back was equally impracticable.</p>
               <p>"Hell's flames!" swore Garcia. "I'd like to be at Fairgrove's throat for rousing
                  the country against us. We must fight out this way," and he turned towards the
                  entry terminating in the stairs far above.</p>
               <p>"There's somebody—" began a cautious one.</p>
               <p>"Somebody? a woman, and alone, or she wouldn't be so noisy! I'll silence her!"</p>
               <p>And all followed Jack's lead to the upper story; not too soon, for from three
                  directions the storming party came into the main room, the flashing of the shots
                  they fired at the fugitives showing them the form of the fainted woman, whom they
                  supposed dead.</p>
               <p>"Heaven, heaven!" answered Fairgrove, auguring nothing favorable from this first
                  sight. "No quarter! Death, death!"</p>
               <p>Luckily, at the very first alarm, Mrs. Fairgrove had locked herself in, and the
                  three-fingered desperado could only fire a shot through the woodwork and was
                  disappointed there. The whole of the Mexicans rushed through the adjoining room
                  and jumped out upon the piazza, over which they slung themselves and slid down the
                  columns. Here the last of them was the living target in which was buried three or
                  four shots, and he sprang off into the air, in which he died, for it was a corpse
                  that fell in a heap on the ground.</p>
               <p>The others ran off, fired at by such of the pursuers as had jumped through the
                  windows upon the top of the verandah, and by the others, who had made the circuit
                  on perceiving their design and who had left the building by the ground-floor.
                  Fairgrove sprang off the top and, alighting with a shock that would have used up a
                  man under less excitement, (for he believed that his sister was undoubtedly dead
                  and his wife at least hurt by the passing shot which Garcia had driven through the
                  bedroom door, and after which she really fainted woman had been silent), he took
                  the lead of the pursuers.</p>
               <p>The flying bandits had struck for the hills sheltering the ranch, with a start of
                  sixty or seventy yards ahead of Fairgrove, foremost of those following them. He
                  was in advance of his friends by some twenty feet. The fugitives bounded up the
                  hills as men can fly when death is the same as delay. The pursuers began to fire
                  at them, but, besides the disadvantage of firing at any mark above one's
                  standpoint, there was that of each party being in haste and motion. The fastest of
                  the flyers had attained such an altitude by this time that they halted in the
                  bushes to cover their comrades with their weapons, and all being together on the
                  top, and drawing a long breath while delivering a general discharge, off they went
                  again down the other side of the rising ground.</p>
               <p>The chasers, pausing a moment on receiving a volley, divided into two bodies!
                  Fairgrove with the smaller, composed of the youngest men, ran on after the
                  robbers, while the rest prudently went quite the other way to mount their horses
                  and try to overtake the escaped ones by this means.</p>
               <p>But their scouring the neighborhood until morning was nearly all in vain, for all
                  they found of the robbers was one dead and another dying, whom their companions
                  had been compelled to abandon. The rest had reached the rendezvous, had been
                  gloomily listened to by the captain and, almost immediately, had started off with
                  him to Indian Creek.</p>

                     MISTRESS.—GARCIA COMES IN HANDY.—THE DOUBLE SURPRISE AND THE DEATH OF THE
                     GO-BETWEEN.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE companions of the highwayman were over in Hangtown, while he stayed at the
                  Springs, keeping quiet, after the failure to assassinate Mr. Fairgrove.</p>
               <p>Joaquin, Valenzuela and Garcia, as a matter of course, went the rounds of the
                  places of amusement, playing the games and making their faces a little known to
                  the girls in the dance-houses.</p>
               <p>We have shown sufficiently already, and will show still more clearly hereafter,
                  how imprudent Garcia was, especially when liquor had reduced him to a less cool
                  state of mind than natural.</p>
               <p>From this recklessness the following true as tragic adventure arose.</p>
               <p>One evening as Valenzuela, alone, was strolling along, he noticed that he was
                  followed by a stranger, all the stranger, too, by its being a women.</p>
               <p>Women were not so numerous nor so safe up by the mines as to be out unattended
                  after dark, for the robber not to notice this.</p>
               <p>But, being a little inflated by drink as well as a vanity that it prompted, he
                  twirled his moustache and beard, smiled, dark as it was, and slackened his
                  pace.</p>
               <p>Then, he turned abruptly and was on the woman before she could slip away, if she
                  had so desired.</p>
               <p>But on the contrary, she came right up to him, smiling reassuringly.</p>
               <p>"Senor," said she in bad Spanish, and in a low voice full of mystery. "I know of a
                  senorita, a real preciosita, who is sighing her heart out to see you close to. If
                  you are brave enough, <emph>brave as Joaquin</emph> the gentleman of the highway,"
                  added she with emphasis full of meaning, "you won't be afraid to meet me under the
                  tree, on that corner at eight to-morrow night!"</p>
               <p>Seeing that—only pausing to be sure that she had been understood—the speaker was
                  going to leave him, Valenzuela hastened to catch her by the arm and thus withdraw
                  a part of the rebozo that hid her features.</p>
               <p>"The deuce!" muttered he, disappointed and ceasing to lick his lips as he had
                  begun to do.</p>
               <p>The face was that of a woman, as old as the hills and less attractive by far.</p>
               <p>"I'm a stranger, I don't know the lady, who is she?" said the bandit.</p>
               <p>"Let me go, senor, I must be back. Be satisfied with what I said. Will you
                  come?"</p>
               <p>A score of thoughts flashed upon him.</p>
               <p>His name, it was clear, and his "handsome appearance (as <emph>he</emph> thought
                  to himself)" had made him be mistaken for his superior.</p>
               <p>Flattering, but, if the lady of the rendezvous should turn out to be Madam
                  Vigilance Committee—whew! So he hesitated.</p>
               <p>"Sainted Mother of Heaven!" cried the woman who rapped out Spanish oaths better
                  than she spoke more proper words, "can a young Mexican be a coward—pshaw! there
                  isn't a <emph>salteador</emph> who wouldn't risk the noose for the beauty I speak
                  for——"</p>
               <p>"I'll——"</p>
               <p>"Do it, eh?" and off she went, turning her head to show him her finger on her
                  lips.</p>
               <p>Valenzuela watched her—now a shadow amid the shadows, then in the light streaming
                  out of saloons, till she was gone.</p>
               <p>"The confounded corrupteress of virtuous youth!" swore he in mock indignation.
                  "Cool as anything, that! What next, I wonder? Well, it'll keep, while I look into
                  friend Barcelonne's and imagine his daughter the beauty—the precious bait this old
                  fisherwoman is trolling for me with!"</p>
               <p>He thought no more about the affair till next afternoon when he woke up after a
                  drunken slumber.</p>
               <p>He had dressed himself for another nocturnal promenade, when he called the
                  appointment to mind.</p>
               <p>If the place had been the City of Mexico, or Guaymas, or even El Paso, Tubac, or
                  Arispe he would have let the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">pros</foreign> very soon
                  overpower the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">cons.</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>As he hated reasoning, he settled the matter by drawing three or four coins out of
                  his pocket and slapping them down on the table.</p>
               <p>The Mexican eagles with their wriggling prizes of snakes, were uppermost on every
                  piece.</p>
               <p>"Go's the word," muttered he. "The <foreign xml:lang="SPA">Libertad</foreign> is
                  very near Libertine."</p>
               <p>He proceeded to arm himself, with a little more care than usual, for, as he
                  said:</p>
               <p>"Spain, Mexico, California—countries where weapons are plenty, so that's there are
                  daggers stuck in every girl's garter."</p>
               <p>At the time, he went out.</p>
               <p>The old woman was at the trysting-place and the two went on together.</p>
               <p>Garcia sat before a monte table in Hannigan's saloon.</p>
               <p>At the first of the evening, he had had great luck, but now he lost heavily, sum
                  upon sum.</p>
               <p>At last, Jack slowly got up, hesitated whether to upset the table and smash his
                  chair on the heads of the crowd, did not do so fortunately, strode to the
                  sideboard, took a glassful of some liquid preparation from the hands of a water,
                  and took it all down, ice and mint-stalks at two gulps like a whale engulfing
                  sprats and "squids."</p>
               <p>Then he moved towards the entrance, slowly.</p>
               <p>He had not reached it before a slight tap on his elbow made him look around or
                  rather down, angrily, for he felt in the "tearing" humor.</p>
               <p>A crooked, dwarfed figure of about four feet six was beside him.</p>
               <p>He recognized the face and trunk, which was perfect, as the bankers of the very
                  table at which his funds had been converted into decidedly sinking ones.</p>
               <p>As the dwarf had always been seated, he had never noticed the malformation of his
                  lower limbs, which seemed to have been visited equally wickedly by different
                  sprites, for they were bandy, twisted, bowed, shriviled-up, and terminated in some
                  peculiar mis-shaping of the feet, for the wadded boot was not at all of a natural
                  shape.</p>
               <p>The three-fingered Mexican observed all this, and therefore set down the
                  maliciousness and imprisoned violence revealed on the countenance upturned to his
                  to no evil meaning to him.</p>
               <p>"Do you want to make up your loss?" squealingly hissed the dwarf, working his
                  fingers, as exquisitely shaped as a lady's, nervously till one would have thought
                  they were handfuls of snakes.</p>
               <p>Jack looked down and all over the speaker.</p>
               <p>"I don't mind," said he readily.</p>
               <p>"Steel recovers gold often," said the Quilp of the green cloth in a hoarse tone
                  now, for he was not master of his voice any more than a confirmed asthmatic.</p>
               <p>"So they say," answered the bandit, most non-committally if there is such a
                  word.</p>
               <p>The two looked at one another, till their glances met into one of complete
                  agreement.</p>
               <p>The gnome gambler drew the broken gamester aside, and the two began whispering,
                  their voices being past hearing even if they had shouted in that everlasting<pb
                     n="80-81" xml:id="VAC8324-00000042"/> erlasting chorus of chinking coin,
                  scuffling of feet, jingling of glasses, explosions of excited voices in oaths,
                  yells or laughter.</p>
               <p>Some days passed.</p>
               <p>Joaquin the chief heard no bad tidings of his comrades and concluded no news was
                  good news.</p>
               <p>Garcia and Valenzuela slept off their night's libations during the morning, and
                  had a little practice with cards in the afternoon perhaps ere sallying out, but
                  separately now.</p>
               <p>The latter made excuses, which must have appeared for some reason comical to his
                  friend, for he laughed heartily to himself as soon as Valenzuela's back was
                  turned.</p>
               <p>Dark was coming on when Garcia and his employer, as the dwarf banker may be
                  called, were closeted together in a little room behind the bar, where the staff of
                  Hannigan kept their out-of-doors habiliments.</p>
               <p>"Well?" growled the dwarf eagerly.</p>
               <p>"There," answered the Mexican, producing a small box of enameled iron very
                  tastefully got up and evidently a trinket-case from some lady's dressing-room.</p>
               <p>The large eyes of the little man seemed to swell into great globes of flame.</p>
               <p>"Hers! hers! hers!" he repeated three times in as many variations of tone.</p>
               <p>"His! his! his!" said Garcia, not actually mocking the speaker though, whose
                  "touchy" temperament he had learnt no doubt by this time.</p>
               <p>With the utmost coolness, he proceeded to open the casket, of which the lock had
                  been broken already, and lift out a packet of letters.</p>
               <p>He untied a strip of satin binding them, divided the bundle into halves with
                  provoking exactness and, while giving the banker one portion with his
                  three-fingered hand, put the other into his open jacket's bosom.</p>
               <p>"You know how to read"—began Garcia half jesting.</p>
               <p>But the excited dwarf had scarcely glanced at the first of the notes than the
                  blood rushed into his face and filled the veins so fearfully that it really made
                  his disproportioned head still larger; his eyes rolled under their brows in a way
                  to remind those who have ever had the misfortune to see it, of the fiery hull of a
                  destroyed steamship rocking beneath an inky cloud on the still-tossing billows
                  that were changeful monuments over the loved but the lost gone down with the spars
                  and life-preservers they were yet lashed to!</p>
               <p>His excessive redness was almost immediately blanched into a pallor, quite as
                  awful and unexpected.</p>
               <p>He had bitten his lips or his tongue, too, for a bloody froth came out over his
                  beard and stained with a couple of drops, the immaculate shirt-front in which
                  glittered a wonderful diamond cluster-pin, those two chief parts of a professional
                  blackleg's uniform.</p>
               <p>"He's going to choke," thought Garcia, and he was almost on the point of running
                  out to the bar for water or brandy.</p>
               <p>But men do not swoon or suffocate so easily.</p>
               <p>"Bitter pill, I know, but it's got to go down, and the sooner the better," said
                  bandit Job's comforter, half aloud.</p>
               <p>The dwarf was in too great a fury to mind him.</p>
               <p>He leaped around the little room from side to side like some wounded animal—like a
                  puma with shot-broken leg, till, getting more calm, he stopped at the washstand,
                  on which was the light, and began to read with a forced tranquility that was worse
                  than the greatest violence would have been.</p>
               <p>He grew paler and paler, shuddered, started, seemed turned into stone till as
                  suddenly he would shiver when he came on some passage relating to himself,
                  perhaps, as if the rowels of a Spanish horse-breaker's spur was ploughing up his
                  flesh.</p>
               <p>His lips quivered at times like the poor fellows who died on the Isthmus with the
                  fever and ague, before many another life of white and mongrel had been given to
                  make that railroad which leaps past the deathful swamps and murderous woods.</p>
               <p>Then again his lips would be drawn together till the least sound could not escape,
                  and the mouth resembled those mute yet terrible old cannon that defy the rust in
                  the ruined yet standing walls of Panama's defence.</p>
               <p>Garcia stood ready for a frightful outbreak, inwardly rejoicing, for he was just
                  fiend enough to relish agony of this kind, but the dwarf only said hoarsely:</p>
               <p>"I want the rest, all!"</p>
               <p>"Five hundred is the figure," remarked the bandit, rustling the letters he had
                  pocketed.</p>
               <p>"What, bargain with me!" began the dwarf, giving rein to his fury's steed. "Give
                  them up, or I'll——"</p>
               <p>"You'll—what? Pooh!" laughed the robber <emph>over</emph> him, eyeing him with
                  some such a look as a wild bull-elephant might give to a tiger-cub.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, the banker had checked himself, and taken out a well-filled wallet,
                  from which he took a check.</p>
               <p>"For six hundred and some cents on the express men of San Francisco. You can get
                  it cashed at Sacramento, or anybody will buy it."</p>
               <p>When the Mexican had carefully folded up the paper and put it away, he handed the
                  letters to his patron, who grasped them with his gaze too intently fastened on
                  them to notice how greedily the bandit had regarded his wallet.</p>
               <p>"The same, same thing," muttered the dwarf after having scanned a few of the
                  notes, "love for him—scorn, worse—G—d—her! for me! oh! I'll have her heart's blood
                  never mind! Now, hark ye, amigo," continued he to the bandit, "you are in the way
                  to make your fortune, even as fortunes rate in this blessed land. You kill this
                     <hi rend="i"/>Joaquin and get the reward out for him, <emph>dead</emph> or
                  alive! You have had considerable money already. Well! am I rating a woman's life
                  too low at a thousand, say?"</p>
               <p>Garcia looked as grave and calculating as a Babbage inventing a new machine, or a
                  Socrates smacking his lips over the hemlock.</p>
               <p>"Considering all things, I'm agreeable," returned he.</p>
               <p>"But no blood of hers is to be shed, no, no, none by you. I want that
                  satisfaction!" said the dwarf, growling, and grinding his teeth, while his fingers
                  resembled the twining snakes once more.</p>
               <p>The bandit held out his hands, over his hirer as if he meant to strangle the
                  latter himself, and worked his fingers in emulation of the other, till the four
                  hands were uplifted as it were in burlesque by demons who had witnessed the oath
                  of William Tell and his friends.</p>
               <p>"Come along, then, since you understand," said the dwarf, rolling along in advance
                  out of the room, more like a tar on his "sea-legs" than anybody else.</p>
               <p>"Understand?" said his satellite, grinning. "May I hang high if I don't. I knife
                  Joaquin (here he laughed queerly), and choke the—a—woman, while you slice her, ha,
                  ha!"</p>
               <p>"And we'll attend to the pocket-book afterwards," added he, to himself. "Bleed
                  bank and banker, that's rich!"</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, the woman who was the main cause of all this, was with her old
                  serving-woman.</p>
               <p>She was somewhat uneasy.</p>
               <p>"What do you think of such goings on, Lizzie?" she asked. "Mr. Walters never let a
                  day go by without showing his hideous Tom Thumb figure here, to me. Come, tell me
                  what you think of it."</p>
               <p>"I can only say, Miss Laury, that he don't guess how handsome you look to-day,
                  or——"</p>
               <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC8324-00000043"/>
               <p>"Oh, away with such stuff. I might have lived in New York to this day, pampered
                  with every kind of luxury, instead of being out in this rude and barbarous world
                  listening to a jargon about 'gulches,' and 'nuggets,' and 'pockets,' and 'claims,'
                  and the deuce knows what else."</p>
               <p>"Then all I can say is, that p'raps the imp—beg your pardon—has smelt a mice with
                  the ugly nose on his monstrous face. Maybe he saw something yesterday that aroused
                  his suspicions——"</p>
               <p>"Well, that was all your fault for falling asleep, Liz.</p>
               <p>"But no—give the old fellow his due. He was in first rate spirits yesterday, for
                  which I give him credit. But I cannot bear the sight of him.</p>
               <p>"Oh, my Mexican is <emph>so</emph> different.</p>
               <p>"But I grow tired of all this medley of mixed wealth and beggary—of mixed luxury
                  and privation. One day drinking champagne out of tin dippers—the next drinking
                  common whiskey out of silver goblets.</p>
               <p>"One day you are flattered, feasted, and caressed—the next in danger of your life
                  from slashing bowie knives or flying bullets.</p>
               <p>"You are introduced to a fellow dressed like a prince, with silver-mounted saddle
                  and fingers flashing with diamonds; and a few hours after his highness is dangling
                  by the neck from a tree, thanks to the promptitude of Judge Lynch.</p>
               <p>"Again, you meet with a man in a red shirt and pilot-cloth pants with a three
                  years' beard on his cheek and chin, and not a single red in his pocket. You treat
                  him with contempt, and find that you have been snubbing a <emph>real</emph>
                  gentleman, by birth, education, manners, and worth."</p>
               <p>She was fair enough looking, was the woman who was giving utterance to these
                  snatches of sense, and she gave other evidences of having been well reared and
                  carefully educated in her far away home.</p>
               <p>But, alas, she had parted with all that native goodness of heart that she once
                  possessed and was now sunk so low as to be the leman of every adventurer.</p>
               <p>"I was saying—what? oh, yes. My monster was in good humor, indeed. He promised me
                  some jewelry, especially a necklace. But neither he nor it will be here to-night,
                  I hope. But my love of a graceful, handsome, gallant bandit will be here—hark! oh!
                  quick! Lizzie, run!"</p>
               <p>While the speaker, quite animated now, took one hurried look at the glass, and
                  then sank down on the sofa, which was <emph>the</emph> article of the room's
                  furniture, in a tempting attitude so deeply studied as to seem natural, the
                  servant was away like a rather slow-flying arrow.</p>
               <p>When she returned, she followed Senor Valenzuela, whose face was wreathed with
                  smiles.</p>
               <p>The old woman took at last survey of the apartment, exchanged a knowing glance
                  with her mistress, and vanished.</p>
               <p>If the couple on whom she had just turned her back had not been full of
                  themselves, they would have heard a suppressed sound and a faint scuffle in the
                  passage, and afterwards a growl, which signified in Garcia's vocabulary:</p>
               <p>"Valga me Dios! the old hag all but made me a Two-fingered Jack with the one or
                  two fangs she has left. Quiet, you venerable!"</p>
               <p>The ancient camerista had run into the very arms of the bandit-in-waiting, and he
                  had almost instantly reduced her to unconsciousness with the pressure round her
                  throat of his vise-like hands.</p>
               <p>In the meantime the lovers had billed and cooed.</p>
               <p>"Oh, my dear love of a hero!" sighed Laura, as romantically as a girl of fifteen,
                  "when, oh, when are we to start for San Francisco and the States? I have plenty of
                  money, you have as much, you assure me, let us go there to enjoy ourselves. You
                  can be a Spanish prince; you look it. Won't we lead a life of brilliancy!
                  theatres, moonlight drives, suppers, parties, all the balls, every mortal thing
                  heart can desire!"</p>
               <p>The syren looked very handsome.</p>
               <p>Her cheeks were suffused with something of the red blushes of her spring time; her
                  eyes danced and sparkled like brilliants; and her superb figure was set off with
                  everything that could display it to the best advantage.</p>
               <p>She forced him away with a strength generally to be found in the perfectly formed,
                  a strength which explained why the dwarf required his brave to hold her while he
                  should deal the blows.</p>
               <p>"Joaquin, when we are aboard the steamer, and the coast out of view."</p>
               <p>The slight, small Mexican girls were before sufficiently beautiful in the robber's
                  eyes; he had no other kind to contrast with them, so that this lovely woman, with
                  dark brown hair, and dark eyes approaching jet, but of a milk and roses
                  complexion, with a stature equal to his, splendidly rounded, subdued him so that
                  he assented to everything.</p>
               <p>And all the while he, the lady-killer, the man experienced in woman's wiles,
                  forsooth, did not dream that little was he to obtain from her, her sole intentions
                  being to attract him to San Francisco, where she would coolly turn over the
                  supposed Joaquin to the authorities.</p>
               <p>The reward would nicely pay her passage home, and fit her up in dresses and
                  jewelry, was to make her the belle who always gets the best seat in the cabin, has
                  the captain's telescope, books and conversation, as well as the first help at the
                  table and <emph>the</emph> wine of wines.</p>
               <p>"And will not your little man, the <foreign xml:lang="SPA">tortilla,</foreign> be
                  in a dreadful state?" asked the robber.</p>
               <p>"Oh, I suppose so. You ought to see him when he is mad—just like a devil. He
                  stamped around this room like a—I don't know what; oh, he's awful at times. He is
                  quite agreeable by contrast just now, though. He has promised me no end of things,
                  which he will have up from the city. He is rich enough and generous enough, that
                  is true."</p>
               <p>"Rich? he ought to be. Why, I've lost several thousand at his very table," said
                  Valenzuela.</p>
               <p>"Indeed! Oh, you gamblers! If you could only see my banker when he's in the humor
                  and describes and mimics the faces of the losers and winners. He is impassable as
                  statue."</p>
               <p>"As a statue. Never winks as he draws the piles towards him or pushes them
                  away."</p>
               <p>"So I believe. Then we'll only be enjoying your own money again, by taking his,"
                  said Laura, with a smile that had nothing to do with her words, but which was
                  extremely bewitching nevertheless.</p>
               <p>"That is very true, my girl," said Valenzuela. "Has he most of his money here, or
                  does he send it to the States?" continued the robber, who was not so enthralled as
                  to forget the chance there appeared to be of enriching himself with the gambler's
                  hoarded wealth.</p>
               <p>"Oh, he has any quantity of gold, in dust, nuggets, and coin, besides heaps of
                  watches and rings, which he loans money on to his customers when they 'get
                  broke'—as they frequently do," replied Laura.</p>
               <p>"Is he not afraid of osing all this treasure?"</p>
               <p>"But this is dull talking, my girl," said the robber.</p>
               <p>"True—true," said Laura. "But I will soon surprise you."</p>
               <p>"Surprise me in what manner?"</p>
               <p>"You shall soon see the present from my dwarf."</p>
               <p>"The present?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. I'm promised a necklace of great value, but it hasn't come——"</p>
               <p>"Pardon, senorita, here it is!" broke in a rude voice.</p>
               <p>The lovers started up, and Valenzuela placed himself before the woman, his knife
                  in his hand.</p>
               <p>But he lowered its point almost instantly.</p>
               <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC8324-00000044"/>
               <p>"Jack!" he exclaimed at the height of surprise.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Joaquin," returned the bandit.</p>
               <p>"What brings you here, of all in the world?"</p>
               <p>"I told you. Senorita, here's your necklace!" continued Jack, stretching out his
                  hands most significantly.</p>
               <p>She recoiled.</p>
               <p>He laughed, and began whispering to his comrade.</p>
               <p>"Not a moment to be lost!" cried the latter, thereupon; "pack up your valuables
                  quickly! The banker has paid this man to help kill you and me! Come."</p>
               <p>Like one in a dream, the beauty caught up here and there an article, stuffed all
                  into the first little box at hand and while she robed herself, Valenzuela
                  exchanged a few last words with his companion in crime.</p>
               <p>Then, the robber, carrying the jewel-box, and the woman ran out of the room, he
                  coolly, she mechanically. Garcia followed them into the entry, but only to lift
                  unseen the body of the stifled woman, and lug it back into the bedroom.</p>
               <p>He flung it on the bed, covered it over, tossed a silk scarf of gay colors on the
                  face, and gave the body a severe pinch on the side, which, forcing an instintive
                  shrinking away, proved that Lizzie was not lifeless.</p>
               <p>Next, the robber remembered his trade and, after repairing the disorder caused in
                  the room by the flight, pocketed whatever there was portable and valuable, flung a
                  satisfied look over the place, indulged in what seemed a sudden fit of madness in
                  dancing about and kicking over a chair or two and the table, from which slid the
                  candlestick to be extinguished on the floor.</p>
               <p>Then, he pushed out the window, and leant out.</p>
               <p>A black ball was beneath, having just escaped the fallen sash.</p>
               <p>"Quick!" said Jack, leaning out farther than ever till he caught hold of the
                  dwarf's hands.</p>
               <p>The latter was mounted on a gardner's wheelbarrow, standing on which on tiptoe
                  made him about a man's height.</p>
               <p>Most unceremoniously, in fact with no more care than the Vigilance Committee's
                  hangman displayed when running their convicts up to the pulley-sheave of the
                  projecting beam of a grain-loft, the Mexican pulled his employer clean through the
                  window into the room.</p>
               <p>His haste was compelled by his hearing a choking sob behind him, from the bed,
                  which betokened Lizzie's coming to.</p>
               <p>He dropped the dwarf on the floor and crying: "Come, come!" darted at the form
                  just moving the coverlet.</p>
               <p>He arrived just in time to smother the woman's voice, for she had recovered
                  consciousness and would have uttered a shrill scream only for Jack's iron
                  gripe.</p>
               <p>He merely let her have a little breath, just as an angler gives a fish "play," and
                  hauled her upon the floor completely disguised by the whole of the sheets and
                  counterpanes.</p>
               <p>"Quick, sir," said the wretch coolly; "she's lively, and I cannot hold her——"</p>
               <p>The monstrosity gave full sweep to his rage.</p>
               <p>While the woman suffered for her mistress, groaning, attempting to shriek and
                  writhing horribly, the dwarf plied the dagger, yelling:</p>
               <p>"I'm a horrible, disgusting object! I'm worse than a snake! I'm a reptile! I'm a
                  despicable, hateful crawling newt! I'm a—wretch! I—I! ah! Go, shameful thing to
                  find your superior man of a lover! Is <emph>he</emph> dead, sir?"</p>
               <p>"If he ain't, he will be soon," returned Garcia chuckling. "She's a goner,
                  anyhow," pursued he, unclasping his hands from the neck of the muffled woman, a
                  corpse bleeding at fifty gashes now.</p>
               <p>"Light up till I see them both!" said the dwarf kneeling down by Lizzie, and while
                  holding his blood-running blade in one closely clenched hand, he began unfolding
                  the envelopes of the murdered one.</p>
               <p>At the same moment that Three-fingered Jack tranquilly hunted up a candle and lit
                  it, he heard the dwarf emit a dreadful howl.</p>
               <p>He had touched the face of the dead woman and had naturally been amazed to feel
                  wrinkles and roughness in lied of Laura's matchless soft and even flesh.</p>
               <p>His hair stood on end like a vulture's neck-feathers, and he leaped up and
                  snatched away the candle from the grinning desperado.</p>
               <p>"Hell fire! it's the old jade?"</p>
               <p>"So it is," said Three-fingered Jack, as tranquilly as possible.</p>
               <p>The dwarf turned on him, and brandished his blood-streaked dagger.</p>
               <p>"Are you false! where's the dead man!"</p>
               <p>"In your shoes, you fool!" roared the Mexican, whose knife was already out.</p>
               <p>The candle was flung in his face, as the dwarf followed it in a spring at the
                  bandit's throat.</p>
               <p>In the dark the struggle went on.</p>
               <p>Suddenly as many as twenty shots rang out, and a shout went up in the same place,
                  outside the house.</p>
               <p>"Joaquin the robber! Fire, fire on him!"</p>
               <p>"The devil!" exclaimed Garcia, half rising and kneeling on the conquered dwarf,
                  while he searched him. "It was time to finish the little hunchback with a bone (of
                  steel) in his throat. I've the money, anyhow."</p>
               <p>He kicked the dwarf upon the other body and listened.</p>
               <p>The sounds in the street had continued but went away from the house.</p>
               <p>"All right. Valenzuela clear. I hope, with the booty. Good night, loving couple,"
                  concluded he laughing as he backed out of the room, casting a farewell look on the
                  two bodies horribly seeming to embrace one another.</p>
               <p>When Valenzuela and his beautiful charge made for the front door, they did not
                  progress as fast as they should. Their emotion more than the difficulty of
                  advancing in the dark, had delayed them. Before sallying out, the robber thought
                  to quiet his companion with a warm salute and a cheering word or two. This
                  occupation was so pleasant, that his caution was so lulled and he did not hear the
                  following low-spoken sentences without:</p>
               <p>"S'pose it tain't," said one man of nearly a dozen who stood in the street beside
                  the door of the house.</p>
               <p>"Oh, shut up, old Careful. I tell you it was Three-fingered Jack who went in here
                  and that proves the old woman is not lying. Joaquin must be in. So use your
                  shooters, I say. You can't hit an honest man in their s'ciety; I guess not! 'Sh!
                  ready, boys!"</p>
               <p>The instant Valenzuela opened the door and stepped out, three or four pair of
                  hands lunged at him, and they got a good hold of him before he could shake off his
                  surprise.</p>
               <p>He struggled then, but to shake off their grasp was a less easy feat.</p>
               <p>Furious at having fallen so blindly into a trap, he fought as only a madman might
                  have been expected to do, or a sane man whose head was doomed to the halter.</p>
               <p>He bit, struck, kicked, butted and plunged about in the ring of the dozen men, who
                  had already secured his weapons.</p>
               <p>"Give in, you dod-rotted gopher! The woman's sold you!"</p>
               <p>"She! the b—"</p>
               <p>"No, no!" screamed Laura, who had seen all this occur in a twinkling while unseen
                  herself and nailed to the spot by surprise and terror. "And I'll prove I was true
                  to you, Joaquin!"</p>
               <p>When a man lies dying of wound or illness, the woman who little liked him before,
                  has been known to love him then; when he, unthought of before, has<pb n="86-87"
                     xml:id="VAC8324-00000045"/> been about to perish, the woman has suddenly been
                  exalted from a passing whim to a do-all, dare-all passion.</p>
               <p>So with Laura.</p>
               <p>Gay woman as she was, who had determined secretly to sell her plaything for
                  blood-money when it should become tiresome, yet here, with her own idea embodied
                  under her eyes, she hated the too-truthful assertion in one sense, though
                  unfounded in another.</p>
               <p>Like a lioness, she burst into the centre of the group and frantically smote and
                  tore at the faces of the men.</p>
               <p>Their astonishment aided her purpose, and, panting, bleeding a little, exhausted
                  for the moment, Valenzuela stood comparatively free.</p>
               <p>He caught his breath instantly, and wrenched himself from the hands yet on him;
                  true, they were benumbed by the very tenacity of their hold.</p>
               <p>Then, as if winged, ignobly forgetting her who had dashed in to save him, he sped
                  up the street towards the end from which no one was running up, as there was from
                  the other.</p>
               <p>Out flashed all the fire-arms and the whole group hurried after him, scarcely
                  seeing, such was their desire to secure "Joaquin," that Laura ran amongst them,
                  striking aside this weapon, and that, as she saw them leveled at the fugitive.</p>
               <p>She felt her strength failing her; she made a great effort, for all the men had
                  stopped for the same fatal purpose, and darted in advance of them.</p>
               <p>She <unclear>flung</unclear> herself straight in front of all the barrels and
                  opened her arms to embrace their missiles like Winkelried sweeping in the tyrant's
                  spears.</p>
               <p>A rattle of twelve to twenty shots was followed by a mocking cheer from the
                  fugitive bandit vanishing unhurt, and by a many-voiced ejaculation from the
                  marksmen as the smoke curled upwards and showed them a white figure, spotted with
                  red blots growing larger momentarily, stretched on the ground at their feet.</p>
               <p>"What's the news, fellows?" said a new comer from down the river, as he slung his
                  leg over his horse's neck and dismounted to saunter into the first saloon, next
                  morning.</p>
               <p>"News! the hugest thing yet! what'll you take?" asked the bar-tender, who was
                  missing his own morning call.</p>
               <p>"The black bottle, <emph>you</emph> know! quit your joking, Joe!"</p>
               <p>"Why, you know Shorty the twistified banker of Hannegan's?"</p>
               <p>"I <emph>should</emph> think it! The side-show 'walk in, ladees 'n' gen'l'men 'n'
                  see the smallest living man in the world,' as I allers said he was. Many's the
                  'slug' his table swallowed of mine. Somebody's 'leaded' him for thumbing a
                  jack?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no! steel. Why, Joaquin and Three-fingered Jack had their gang in town last
                  night about eleven, broke into the dwarf's house, where he's been keeping an
                  all-fired beauty that would make Lola dim beside her—a rosebud in full bloom and a
                     <emph>leetle more,</emph> they say! knifed him and a cook and an old woman, had
                  a fight with a crowd of volunteers and Constable Talbert, and got off on the

                  down to the court-house and some of the boys you know will let yer see her—worth

               <p>And this is the story, which we have truly told.</p>

                  <p>LYING IN WAIT.—STOPPING THE STAGE.—THE CHIEF GAME NOT BAGGED.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SOME time after the failure to assassinate Mr. Fairgrove, on arrival at Diamond
                  Spring, near Hangtown, Joaquin was informed by one of his associates who kept in
                  the first named place a dance-house, that, on the following morning, the stage
                  between Hangtown and Sacramento would carry, besides the mail and several
                  passengers, a rather large sum of gold-dust destined for the East, <foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">via</foreign> San Francisco.</p>
               <p>During the opening months of his profession, Murieta had tried his hand at
                  stopping a stage running to or from Mokelumne; but the insignificant result
                  obtained had disgusted him from that Dick Turpin line of his calling, and he had
                  preferred to increase his gains in a different manner.</p>
               <p>Still, he did not deem it proper to reject the intelligence given to him and he
                  resolved at all hazards to make himself master of the Hangtown conveyance. Forty
                  thousand dollars, for so went the report, was not a sum to be sneezed at; he
                  wanted no greater one to be enabled to gain Mexico, enrol the forces of which he
                  stood in need, and enter upon the brilliant plan which he had formed of sacking
                  the lower provinces.</p>
               <p>He took Valenzuela and Three-fingered Jack into his confidence and acquainted them
                  with the intention he had of attacking the vehicle: they, eager moreover to wipe
                  out their last defeat, had only been waiting for some new chance.</p>
               <p>That very evening they went out along the road to choose a site for the
                  ambush.</p>
               <p>After having slowly proceeded through almost the whole night, the three Mexicans
                  stopped at length, in an isolated spot, covered with thick bushes and stunted
                  trees, situated about half way between Mississippi Bar and White Rock House.
                  Joaquin posted his two men on the left of the road, behind a hedge of briars and
                  wild vegetation but near the roadside, while he took up a similarly concealed
                  stand on the right.</p>
               <p>Two hours of anxious watch crept slowly on, and already in the east were the first
                  streakings of dawn appearing, and yet there had been no signs of the expected
                  prey.</p>
               <p>The chief had had it from a sure source that it was to have set out from Hangtown
                  between one and two of the morning, and yet here it was half after six.</p>
               <p>He doubted; his informant must have been mistaken.</p>
               <p>He crossed the road to his followers, almost decided to turn back to Diamond
                  Springs and run the risk of meeting the stage in some other place.</p>
               <p>Valenzuela and Garcia, their horses' noses rubbing and they themselves as
                  comfortably settled in the saddle as possible, were smoking as they patiently let
                  time pass.</p>
               <p>Seeing them so easy, Murieta thought to wait for another hour. But, at the end of
                  fifteen minutes, Three-fingered Jack drew his revolver and began capping it.</p>
               <p>"Here it comes!" exclaimed he.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Joaquin, "I hear the wheels. A few words before it comes up. I was so
                  busy with other matters until now that I forgot to tell you what to do."</p>
               <p>"Why, Santa Maria!" said Jack, "there ain't two ways of killing the goose. Pistol
                  'em all and search for——"</p>
               <p>"Silence!" broke in the highwayman. "Hark to me at the first signal, dart out and
                  take each a side of the stage, while I'll stop the horses. I don't want a single
                  cap snapped till my order says so—mind that, Jack! You understand, friends?"</p>
               <p>"Perfectly, senor," rejoined Valenzuela, politely bowing.</p>
               <p>"All right," growled Garcia, "only I can't say I like the idea——"</p>
               <p>"Ready! No more. Remember!"</p>
               <p>And as the grating and grinding sound of the wheels grew louder, the captain
                  crossed to his place of concealment. In five minutes afterwards, the object of<pb
                     n="88-89" xml:id="VAC8324-00000046"/> their ambush, appeared round a turn in
                  the highway. It was drawn by four horses, who went at a gallop, seeming to be
                  inspired by the fresh early air that they drank in with open nostrils.</p>
               <p>In another minute, all were abreast of the hidden highwaymen. Suddenly a peculiar
                  cry arose.</p>
               <p>Joaquin shot out from the side of the road and, with a leveled pistol, whose
                  bright steel barrel glittered in the grey light, commanded the halt in a most
                  menacing voice. At the same time, Valenzuela and Three-fingered Jack made their
                  appearance and dashed up to the doorways.</p>
               <p>The latter held his pistol so unpleasantly near the occupants that they shrank
                  over to the other side against their companions, who were recoiling likewise from
                  Valenzuela, and were half dead with terror at the Mexican's horrible
                  imprecations.</p>
               <p>The driver, on seeing Murieta, had drawn back and pulled up his four-in-hand. He
                  had seen at first blush that it was useless to attempt to dash past, and he could
                  remark, or rather had remarked, that Joaquin did not handle his revolver like a
                  man unused to weapons.</p>
               <p>As soon as the stoppage had been completed, the chief exchanged his position for
                  Valenzuela's and took upon himself the delicate occupation of forcing the victims
                  to "deliver."</p>
               <p>"Now, gentlemen," said he, looking in on the travelers, more dead than alive,
                  "hand out that box and be quick, for I have no time to lose. Come, make
                  haste!"</p>
               <p>"Yes caramba, make haste," echoed Garcia, ferociously, "or I'll make
                  pepper-bottle-tops out of your heads!"</p>
               <p>"Bu—but, mister highway—ay—Mister Mexican, I mean—don't be so quick," stammered a
                  fat Englishman filling out a great deal of the back seat and trying to ward off
                  the revolver which Jack kept obstinately pointed at his ear. "By George, there
                  hain't h'any baux heah, I assure yaar!"</p>
               <p>"We'd chuck it out mighty quick, if there was," said somebody else.</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes," chorussed the other travelers, "there isn't any box whatever, large or
                  small," repeated they, drawing in against one another, till they were like red
                  herrings in a case, from the ominous sextuple muzzles of the revolver.</p>
               <p>"Driver, where's the dust you're taking to Sacramento?" demanded Joaquin,
                  furiously.</p>
               <p>"There's not a grain of gold, sir, in the coach. Yesterday, we carried a big
                  iron-bound chest to Sacramento, but this trip, nary box."</p>
               <p>"I'll see, first, and if your'e lying, look out!"</p>
               <p>"I'll be d—d if you'll find any, hunt as you like, sir," said the driver.</p>
               <p>Joaquin flung open the door, while Jack did the same on the other side, and
                  cried:</p>
               <p>"Out of this, every one of you!"</p>
               <p>The order was quickly executed.</p>
               <p>Two of those on Garcia's side made a little delay, when he caught one by the
                  collar and pulled him through in so unceremonious a fashion that the other leaped
                  out as lightly as a dancer.</p>
               <p>The last was a young woman, of Mexican origin no doubt, who had not been noticed
                  before by the chief.</p>
               <p>She threw back her shawl and held out to him a little crucifix of gold set with
                  diamonds, which he, after having taken and examined it, returned with some
                  compliment quite in the ancient highwaymen's vein.</p>
               <p>After having minutely examined the interior, without having been able to discover
                  anything whatever, Joaquin climbed upon the roof and looked at the boot but there
                  was no treasure there unless the ends of useless whip-lashes and spare buckles and
                  straps are accounted precious.</p>
               <p>So Murieta, cursing his ill fortune, ordered the travelers to retake their places,
                  after paying him for <emph>their</emph> trouble, and called off Valenzuela as a
                  token of his permission being given to the driver to go ahead.</p>
               <p>He let out his whip, and off went the four horses at a gallant pace.</p>
               <p>Three-fingered Jack, on hearing the order and seeing the stage started, wheeled
                  and sent a couple of bullets over the top of the dust-enveloped vehicle at the
                  head of the driver, who was not touched luckily.</p>
               <p>With angry look and gesture, the captain commanded the treacherous miscreant to
                  put up his weapon, or else he would slay him on the spot.</p>
               <p>"He ought to have carried the box of gold to-day!" growled Jack, as if he were
                  stating a most conclusive reason for his action.</p>
               <p>Joaquin could not help laughing.</p>
               <p>The three hastened back to Diamond Springs, to the house of their friend, whose
                  ears were gratified by an account of the exploit and his eyes by the sight of the
                  pretty well-filled pocket-books and money-belts which had been taken from the
                  travelers.</p>
               <p>For a whole week, the highwaymen dwelt in concealment in their friend's house and,
                  when the noise caused by the stopping of the stage had diminished, they mounted
                  their horses, which had been kept in a sure place, and directed their steps still
                  again to Sonora Pass.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>A SHORT time after their departure from Diamond Spring the chief and his comrades
                  established a temporary camp on the northern branch of the Stanislaus River.</p>
               <p>The place had appeared to them on the previous evening to be utterly apart from
                  human habitation.</p>
               <p>But, when they arose at the break of dawn they were surprised to behold at a
                  little distance an encampment of several men, who were guessed correctly to be
                  French.</p>
               <p>The latter did not suspect in the least what undesirable neighbors they had, and
                  were quite ignorant of the true trade of the new-comers.</p>
               <p>When the latter appeared before them and asked them what was their business in so
                  out-of-the-way a place, they answered without any hesitation that they were
                  gold-seekers.</p>
               <p>"So are we," remarked Joaquin, "we're gold-seekers and are very eager to make a
                  raise of the dust, if it is possible hereabouts."</p>
               <p>"Ah, but it is ver' possible," replied the apparent principal of the party. "The
                  place is excellent, gold here abounds. "But," added he in his best English, "you

               <p>"Oh! you're a little out there—we are well supplied; but are you sure the diggings
                  pay?"</p>
               <p>"Perfectly! Believeey-vous that four or five men like us would muse ourselves in
                  working for nothig? No, no! We have found what you call some good deegin's, and we
                  are well decided to dwell the longest time possible in this gran-n-nd
                  raypubleek!"</p>
               <p>"You are likely to dwell in it longer than you fancy," said Joaquin, suddenly
                  drawing his revolver; "but you won't <emph>live</emph> in it long enough to
                  improve your excellent English," added he, while his companions displayed their
                  weapons, "unless you turn over to us every particle you possess!"</p>
               <p>"Holy heaven! name of a saint! mon Dieu Lord!" ejaculated the Gauls.</p>
               <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC8324-00000047"/>
               <p>On seeing the menacing attitude of the Mexicans, they could not hope for joke to
                  be before them. Four of the five ran to their tents and re-appeared the next
                  moment, revolver in hand, but, before they had time to take aim, Jack,
                  Three-fingers and Valenzuela had fired two or three shots a-piece and slain
                  them.</p>
               <p>The last of the unfortunates entreated mercy, but, hardly had he given up several
                  pounds of gold dust, the fruits of long toil, than he was killed pitilessly like
                  his fellows.</p>
               <p>As unconcernedly as possible, the murderers sat down to the breakfast of the
                  Frenchmen, whose blood had scarcely ceased to flow.</p>
               <p>While they were thus busied, they were abruptly interrupted by a loud shout.</p>
               <p>They looked straight before them and beheld, on the other bank of the stream, ten
                  men, all on horseback, and armed with revolvers and rifles, the foremost of them
                  being the everlasting Arkansaw."</p>
               <p>"That Yankee again!" exclaimed Joaquin, on foot at the moment. "Quick, quick, to
                  horse!"</p>
               <p>Jack growled like a dog from whom a bone was being taken, and was only quickened
                  in his movements by two bullets buzzing near him and a third denting a tin plate
                  which he was just about reaching for.</p>
               <p>He flew into the saddle like the others, at that, cursing the Americans in general
                  and "Arkansaw and his crowd" in particular.</p>
               <p>"Caramba! to spoil a man's meal," grumbled he. "Here's the time to wait for them
                  and pitch into them."</p>
               <p>"Of course, it is," said Murieta sarcastically, "when they are three to one and
                  with rifles, too. I tell you, you may look upon yourself as very well off that
                  they haven't done for one or two of us, as it is. Fools for having given us
                  warning!"</p>
               <p>"There they are crossing the stream. They'll be over soon. Push on," said
                  Valenzuela.</p>
               <p>He plied the spurs simultaneously and placed himself so as to cover his chief,
                  while Garcia galloped on in the rear, enraged at having to turn his back on the
                  hated foe.</p>
               <p>Hardly had they gained the summit of the nearest eminence, than they came upon a
                  couple of Chinese who were carry ng their mining implements on their shoulders and
                  were without other weapons than a couple of U. S. cavalry sabres, condemned and
                  probably sold to them cheap at San Francisco, or bought on the way from a
                  deserting soldier.</p>
               <p>Three-fingered Jack flung himself off his horse and on them not only poignarding
                  them but cutting off, their heads which he slung by the hair towards the
                  pursuers.</p>
               <p>Five miles further on, other Chinese were met, and the same act was each time
                  repeated, so that seven heads and seven trunks were passed by the Americans,
                  almost witnesses of the crimes without power to prevent them.</p>
               <p>During four days, the bandits continued to fly until, after the chasers were
                  propably shaken off they made for Sonora Pass.</p>
               <p>On the last of another four-and-twenty hours, they reached the head-quarters.</p>
               <p>They dismounted without announcing their return by the signal agreed upon, and,
                  while Jack led the horses to water to the neighboring pond, Joaquin and Valenzuela
                  advanced towards the camp. When at the first tent, they halted and saw three of
                  their comrades deep in the mysteries of the fifty-two leaves of the Satanic
                  prayer-book.</p>
               <p>They were so absorbed in their games that they did not in the least notice the
                  coming of their officers.</p>
               <p>"This is nice!" said Joaquin sternly, "immense resistance you could offer the
                  Yankees, I don't think!"</p>
               <p>Immediately the players, dropping their "hands," like sleepers suddenly awakened,
                  sprang to their feet and drew their revolvers, and, seeing whom they were that
                  they had to do with, they tried to laugh it off, and wished their superiors a
                  hearty welcome.</p>
               <p>"Carajo!" said one, "the devil fly away with me if I didn't think the Yankees had
                  the camp!"</p>
               <p>"Which they might easily do," rejoined Joaquin, looking around on the whole camp,
                  then quite deserted; "yes, without the least difficulty, with all possible case.
                  Where are the men?"</p>
               <p>"Out a hunting grizzly."</p>
               <p>"Are the ladies hunting, too?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, captain. They strolled off towards the rivulet, and are under some tree,
                  I suppose."</p>
               <p>"Very well; I will go myself and see what has become of them. Stay here,
                  Valenzuela, and if the men come back before I do, put some of them on guard on
                  every point where you may think a sentry is needed. Those cursed fellows are fully
                  capable of not being thrown off our trail, for all our trouble, and popping in
                  upon us of a sudden."</p>
               <p>"That is to be feared, senor," said Valenzuela, "and we must prevent their kind
                  visit, for the sake of the senoritas, at any rate. In case the rest of the boys
                  are not back in a quarter of an hour, I will put these three here on the point
                  furthest west of the mountains and go myself to attend to the pass."</p>
               <p>Joaquin approved of this idea, and, trusting all to the lieutenant, sauntered off
                  to find the girls.</p>
               <p>On coming to the pond, while keeping himself behind a clump of saplings, he
                  perceived them merrily bathing under the shade of some trees, hanging on to the
                  pendant branches and gracefully swimming.</p>
               <p>As they were not unaware that the men might pass by at any time, they had taken
                  the precaution, in remembrance of past shamefulness, to attire themselves in
                  habits, which prevented the eavesdropper from a treat as delightful as that of
                  years ago in which Clarina and himself were the respective entertainer and
                  entertained.</p>
               <p>In the woods, there was only a gentle murmur broken now and anon by the whizzing
                  of a fly-catcher's wings, or the "whit-er-wheel" of a quail.</p>
               <p>Joaquin was waiting, calculating the effect which he would produce by an
                  unexpected presence among the bathers, enjoying their alarm and confusion in
                  anticipation, when a piercing scream, preceding many others, came upon his
                  ear.</p>
               <p>Hardly had he heard the first, seemingly uttered by Clarina, than he sprang out of
                  his covert; but the danger was passed already.</p>
               <p>He only rushed upon the spot to see Three-fingered Jack plunging his knife into
                  the belly of a good sized grizzly.</p>
               <p>Jack, after tending to the horses, had left the harness on the ground and laid
                  down in the bushes, not far from the sheet of water in which the robbers' naiads
                  were disporting.</p>
               <p>Calmer than usual and affected more deeply than he would have supposed possible by
                  the peacefulness round about, he fell off into a half slumber, dreaming while he
                  dozed.</p>
               <p>His thoughts turned back to many years before when he had been young and unused to
                  crime.</p>
               <p>His remembrances of a woman whom he had loved, had a stamp put upon them by his
                  hearing faintly a clear sweet voice of a woman.</p>
               <p>It awoke him and, still half-roused only, he staggered out of the thicket, when a
                  scream made him fully conscious and led him to save from the clutches of the bear
                  the mistress of his chief.</p>
               <p>On beholding the animal, he had thrown himself between it and the flying<pb
                     n="92-93" xml:id="VAC8324-00000048"/> woman, and <unclear>flung</unclear> his
                  blanket over its head, following up the momentary check by savage states; he was
                  dealing the last stroke when his captain appeared.</p>
               <p>Clarma was following her companions, who were fleeing in all haste from the scene
                  of terror, but, at the sight of her lover, she stopped, turned and ran to throw
                  herself into his arms, explaining to him all that had happened.</p>
               <p>Joaquin, without even thinking of asking how the brave rescuer had chanced to be
                  there so opportunely, shook his hand, still wet with blood as it was, and and
                  warmly expressed expressed his gratitude.</p>
               <p>"Garcia," said he, "you have saved a life dear to me. I am made your debtor
                  henceforth by that; I am your devoted friend, remember."</p>
               <p>For the first time during many long years, a smile lit up the face, impassible and
                  almost always ferocious, of Three-fingered Jack, the merciless bandit who, under
                  the flimsy cloak of revenging the death of his mistress, had committed no end of
                  horrible crimes.</p>
               <p>"It's nothing to tumble over a bear," he said. "No use making a fuss about it. And
                  anyhow, if I did save the senorita from harm, it was more than anything else from
                  my thinking of another."</p>
               <p>"Another what?"</p>
               <p>"Woman. What will you say when I tell you that my presence here was from a dream
                  of the past."</p>
               <p>As soon as the speech was uttered, without adding another syllable, he turned his
                  back unceremoniously on the bandit chief and his mistress, and dived into the
                  shade.</p>
               <p>"Garcia in love, as he seems to mean!" exclaimed Joaquin, in spite of himself.
                  "Really, if he had not just now rendered me a service beyond value, I would be
                  temped to make him the laughing stock of the whole band."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps," said Clarina, "his speech contains some mystery of which we know
                  nothing. He seemed to be referring to the past, mentioning the memory of a
                  woman."</p>
               <p>"At all events, there is something strange in it," concluded the captain, "but he
                  is not soap or sugar to melt. Come, we must return to camp—unless you prefer to
                  visit a certain tree——"</p>
               <p>"Tree, Joaquin?"</p>
               <p>"Why, yes, dear Clarina. Oh, dont't you fancy that I haven't yet seen the pretty
                  little bower you have tastefully formed since I've been away. The canopy of
                  creepers, the flowers on the sides, our initials woven with evergreen in a
                  garland—I know all. I was not back twenty minutes before love guided me to the
                  spot."</p>
               <p>"So I lose the pleasure of surprising you. But you do not—ah! holy Mother, what's
                  that?"</p>
               <p>A dull crash, made by some heavy body in motion through the chapparal, sounded out
                  near the couple. An instant after, another bear, but smaller than the former one,
                  rattled with his claws on the carpet of rotten twigs and leaves past Joaquin and
                  his mistress. As the former tried to shake off Clarina, who clung to him
                  tenaciously, half a dozen of the desperadoes burst through the brush at very
                  nearly the same time, weapon in hand, hurrah'd on by Manuel Guerra.</p>
               <p>"Halt!" cried he, on perceiving his superior.</p>
               <p>The robbers obeyed and, no less astonished than joyous, pressed around to welcome
                  him.</p>
               <p>"You've made short-work of our bruin, captain," remarked Guerra, indicating the
                  carcase of the grizzly.</p>
               <p>"No, no," answered Joaquin. "That is not your fellow—it is some of Three-fingered
                  Jack's hunting."</p>
               <p>"Caramba!" swore the lieutenant, "so ours has escaped? I thought we had him sure
                  when I saw this one."</p>
               <p>At the same moment, twenty or thirty detonations <unclear>echoed</unclear> around
                  in the underwood. Joaquin and those who had met him hurried to the camp, where all
                  were united in four or five minutes, for the remainder of the hunters had slain
                  the second grizzly in the very heart of the head-quarters.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>RETURN OF THE RAVAGERS.—AN ORGIE.—SEVALIO NEARLY HANGED.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TOWARDS the evening of this day, so gloriously marked by the killing of the two
                  bears, Valenzuela and the three men who held the outposts, came into camp. Behind
                  them marched about fifty of their companions, who had been separately marauding in
                  different parts of the State. The commander of each detachment gave over to the
                  chief an account and the product of each expedition; the amount of the whole
                  plunder went as high as a thousand ounces of gold. While the new-comers related to
                  their friends what they had done, the first who had arrived made everything ready
                  for a grand feast, which was to end in a general fandango.</p>
               <p>The great fire was kindled in the centre of the encampment, for the roasting of
                  the grizzlies slain so opportunely. This was to be the chief dish, plenty of
                  provisions, brought by the robbers, was to supply the other demands. Ere long the
                  cooks announced supper to be ready.</p>
               <p>A truce was declared to conversation, and all took their places. The feast was not
                  let cool, for everybody had had their appetite whetted by the various emotions of
                  the day. After that, cigarettes and favorite drinks of the Mexicans went the
                  round, and attention was given to the stories of such of the crew as could rattle
                  off a relation of adventures, highway or amorous. When almost all subjects had
                  been exhausted which could interest the assemblage, Joaquin turned towards
                  Antonio, who had been rather silent since the commencement, and he begged him to
                  say something.</p>
               <p>"Heaven knows, my friends," said Antonio, flinging away the end of a cigar, "that
                  it is utterly impossible for me to recount my experiences for the last quarter of
                  an hour even, seeing that my head is full as an egg of visions of grizzly bear. I
                  was almost asleep and actually dreamed of one of the monsters being about to let
                  me have a left hander with those sweet teeth he carries out of fun at the end of
                  his feet! Thank you, captain, for awaking me. However, if such a thing as a song
                  poorly sung can replace the story I am called upon to give, I will be happy to be
                  agreeable to you, besides it's driying the bear from my mind."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, a song!" exclaimed several voices.</p>
               <p>"Well, what do you speak for?" inquired Antonio. "The Castle of Saint Anna, or the
                  Serenade of Mount Sierra? or—"</p>
               <p>"Give us 'Our land of lands is Mexico,'" said Valenzuela.</p>
               <p>"Willingly; but you must take care and join in the chorus lustily. It's a jolly
                  good bit, which Padre Jurata preferred to anything else, and he had a good ear for
                  hymns; but it is not much unless the chorus is sung heartily."</p>
               <p>"Enough, friend. Fire away!"</p>
               <p>After the usual coughs to clear his throat, Antonio plunged feelingly into the
                  following ballad to the air of "The Pretty Maid of Monterey:"</p>

               <p>"Yes, yes," cried Antonio, "we are the Mexican Band, and we will be still more
                  worthy of the name when our captain is enabled to begin his plan. Long life to
                  Mexico! the land of the Cactus forever! it's the only place in all creation, my
                  lads, except Spain and Italy, where one can pass at ease through a really pleasant
                  existence."</p>
               <p>"Why, have you ever seen those countries?" inquired Valenzuela.</p>
               <p>"Both, certainly," was Antonio's reply. "I was born in Madrid, to begin with, and
                  as for Italy, I may boast that I wasn't the worst brigand in the party that
                  followed the goat-skin jacket of the celebrated Carlotti!"</p>
               <p>"Hullo! did you know Giovanni Carlotti?" exclaimed Guerra.</p>
               <p>"A little. Signor Giovanni Carlotti, the grandson of the one who was second of the
                  world-known Captain Alesandro Massaroni. But, comrades, I will relate my history
                  some other day, I am out of breath for the present."</p>
               <p>"Here, Antonio," said Joaquin, pouring out from a bottle near him some splendid
                  wine, which California with its universal climate, promises to equal some day;
                  "take a sip of this to refresh your mellifluous throat! Fill up, every man of you,
                  and let us drink to the memory of brave Mazzaroni, the valiant captain who
                  said:</p>
               <p>"Short and wise is our motto: Let money be the first of all things. Cowardice
                  alone is a crime. For the rest, let every mother's son of you do what you please.
                  Time's like a bird which is off on the wing and cannot be retained or pulled back.
                  It is easy for one to console himself if haste is made to enjoy what he has."</p>
               <p>Loud acclamation greeted the chief's speech; the glasses chinked merrily, and the
                  toast to one of the prides of the Italian highway was uproariously quaffed by
                  these rangers of El Dorado.</p>
               <p>"Hush!" said Joaquin suddenly; "I thought I heard a signal."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes," returned Valenzuela. "There are some of our comrades returned, and if
                  I am not mistaken, it was Sevalio's call, wasn't it, Margarita? Before ten minutes
                  passes over our heads, you will have your lover by your side."</p>
               <p>"I can't tell," answered the Mexican girl; "you appear to know the signal better
                  than I."</p>
               <p>The chief pulled out of his breast a silver whistle which he put to his lips.</p>
               <p>A piercing sound vibrated around.</p>
               <p>Some few minutes afterwards, the feasters saw Sevalio appear, followed by two more
                  men, who led their horses by the bridle.</p>
               <p>The three were so broken by fatigue that anybody would have taken them from their
                  dragging gait, to have been patients fresh discharged from a hospital.</p>
               <p>Joaquin went to meet them, with Antonio and Valenzuela, while the whole band rose
                  to bid them welcome and to make room for them by the fire.</p>
               <p>"What news, Sevalio?" inquired the bandit leader, when the lieutenant and his men
                  were seated.</p>
               <p>"Stay, captain, stay! And, comrades, pass us some wine quick, for we are half
                  dead!"</p>
               <p>Five or six bottles were instantly handed to the new-comers, and truth obliges us
                  to state that they took more than was good for them.</p>
               <p>"Now, captain," said Sevalio, encircling with one arm the waist of his mistress,
                  who had come to sit beside him, "now I am ready to answer you, but I must open
                  fire by announcing that my tidings are bad. I think even that it would be as well
                  to put them off till to-morrow, if you don't want to becloud the
                  merry-making."</p>
               <p>"No, no," replied the commander, "we must know this evening, uncertainty is never
                  agreeable. Tell us all that has happened to you. I see that you bring back only
                  two out of the whole company of nine that you started off with. Are the rest
                  dead?"</p>
               <p>"Alas, yes. Dead and buried, I hope."</p>
               <p>"How?"</p>
               <p>"Two fell in fair fight; the others——"</p>
               <p>"Go on, the other five——"</p>
               <p>"Were hanged! strung up like jerked beef. Dangling on trees! curse trees! Another
                  bottle, comrades. Let me drink down the remembrance of the scene. I think I feel
                  the rope round my neck yet!"</p>
               <p>"What! around your neck?" queried Joaquin.</p>
               <p>"Around my neck, and the slip noose was drawn d—nably tight, as they dragged me
                  along to the tree, when I got my hands loose, I can't tell how, and streaked for
                  the bush where these two friends were hid, and away we went with half a hundred
                  bullets flying around us. Caramba! the Yankees are more savage than Apaches,
                  they're h—when quiet, but when irritated, stand from under! More wine, boys! Holy
                  Cross, these Yankees don't do things by half generally, and I'm glad I am the
                  exception. They won't even be satisfied with what would be enough for others. When
                  hanging is the work, they want to run a man up higher than any other people in the
                  world would think of doing. I suppose I am left to avenge my poor strangled
                  friends."</p>
               <p>"It is to be hoped," was the general opinion.</p>
               <p>"Where did the bad luck befal you?" asked Guerra.</p>
               <p>"At the branch of the Rio de las Plumas, Feather River, just fifteen miles from
                  Spanish Peak. There was a company of miners there, from eighty to a hundred, whom
                  I'll go bail for being the roughest savages in the state. You ought to have seen
                  how they were armed, real walking batteries, carajo!<pb n="96-97"
                     xml:id="VAC8324-00000050"/> Every one of them had three or four pistols or
                  revolvers, a rifle and a knife as big as a machete."</p>
               <p>"Well," interposed Antonio, "now that you have told us how the affair finished, we
                  won't be sorry to learn how it commenced."</p>
               <p>"I'm willing; here it is," said Sevalio.</p>

                  <p>SEVALIO'S ADVENTURES.—THE ATTACK.—ARKANSAW'S DEFEAT.—RANGING THE
                     BATTLE-FIELD.—RIVALRY.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>"A FEW days after we quitted Red Bluffs," said Sevalio, who was at his fourth
                  bottle," we reached Shasta, were we had the luck of meeting a train of mules
                  carrying gold. We stopped it a couple of miles from the town, took the treasure
                  and the back trail to Red Bluffs, each of us carrying twelve pounds of the spoil.
                  You may believe that we did not let the grass grow under our feet on the road to
                  head-quarters.</p>
               <p>"The men whose goods we had taken were miners and we expected on that account to
                  be pursued very quickly.</p>
               <p>"As we were finishing supper in Pedro's eating-house and about to be off, Pedro
                  warned us that we were watched and that if we did not make haste to flee without
                  being seen, we would run the risk of being hanged if only by suspicion.</p>
               <p>"There was nothing tempting in such a prospect, and we hurried to clear off, but
                  separately and in different directions, our general rendezvous to be Oroville.</p>
               <p>"A numerous set of Germans, French and Yankees were at our heels, and we only gave
                  them the slip at Downieville. To make up for that, we gave chase to four Americans
                  in the valley of Lake Wey, and, catching them there, we left them life in exchange
                  for their money.</p>
               <p>"It was in returning from the lake that we were attacked by the Feather River
                  miners.</p>
               <p>"Two of our men were slain outright, while the enemy had five knocked over.</p>
               <p>"My two here and myself got off, as you know.</p>
               <p>"We remained three days in the brush, eating and drinking nothing for the very
                  reason that we were out of all necessaries, and then we risked going out to make
                  for Sonora Pass. Ten miles or so out of Downieville, we buried the gold, ran off a
                  horse a-piece and—and here we are."</p>
               <p>"There is nothing very gay in that report," observed Joaquin; "but we must expect
                  to turn up a low card once in a while. Pass around the bottle, comrades, and let's
                  have a lively time of it, while we may."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, captain, you are right," said Sevalio, "I agree with you there. Lopez,
                  my friend, let's have a bottle or two, for, by all the saints and saintesses in
                  paradise, I'm weak as water yet! The gallop along the precipices does play a man
                  out, I tell you!"</p>
               <p>"Along the precipices," echoed Antonio. "Did you lose the way?"</p>
               <p>"Not at all, but we took the worst way by the highlands to give the pursuers a
                  bellyful of rackriding."</p>
               <p>"So you were chased, eh? Come, Sevalio, explain in the fiend's name."</p>
               <p>"What, didn't I tell you all about it? The Yankees were behind us when we dashed
                  through the pass by Lake Mono; they rushed us into the mountains and when we threw
                  them off the track, I don't believe they were more than five miles from us."</p>
               <p>"The duece!" exclaimed the chief, springing instantly to his feet, "this is
                  serious. If only that little bit divided you, they'll only need the glimmer of our
                  big fire here to show them the rest of the road."</p>
               <p>"Hush!" interrupted Valenzuela suddenly, "that sound can be only spure jingling on
                  the rocks! Still!"</p>
               <p>All listened.</p>
               <p>"I hear, too," said Murieta, drawing his revolver. "Up, comrades, to arms!
                  Antonio! take thirty or forty men and place them on the rocks commanding the left
                  side of the pass. I'll see to the right with the rest. Come on; men, but softly,
                  for we must not leave one of the spoil-sports to tell the tale."</p>
               <p>The bandits, faithful to the recommendation just given, followed their respective
                  leaders and noiselessly ascended the piles of stone overlooking the entrance.</p>
               <p>Each did his best to hide his advance by the ruggedness of the ground.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, the sound of steps approaching became more and more distinct.</p>
               <p>Every now and then, there was to be heard a savage imprecation of some of the
                  storming party, who had stumbled or slipped on the moss.</p>
               <p>They came into view but slowly on account of the labor required by the
                  advance.</p>
               <p>About twenty feet below the place where Joaquin awaited, the tall, stalwarth form
                  of Arkansaw rose up, leading no less than forty rough-looking men, armed to the
                  teeth.</p>
               <p>"Deuce take me if I fancy this location!" growled Arkansaw.</p>
               <p>He had barely spoken than from every split in the rocky wall before them, a jet of
                  fire issued and the air was filled with smoke and shook with the crash of sixty or
                  seventy shots.</p>
               <p>Half that number of the assailants dropped dead, or fell back desperately
                  injured.</p>
               <p>"Up, up the rock!" cried Arkansaw, whose hat had been blown heaven knows where;
                  "away you go! hands and teeth! It's the only chance, boys—close in!"</p>
               <p>The survivors did begin to climb up the rampart sheltering the banditti, but the
                  one or two who did contrive to mount pretty high, had only the greater distance to
                  fall.</p>
               <p>A second discharge no less deadly than the former, made the wall tremble and down
                  dropped the attacking party, dying or dead. Some of the robbers ran instantly to
                  camp and returned with torches.</p>
               <p>Then the scene appeared in all its horror.</p>
               <p>Nothing could be more frightful than the livid countenances illumined by the
                  flickering and ruddy glare of the resinous brands.</p>
               <p>Joaquin himself could not remain long before such a sight he hastened away to see
                  no more of the awful eyes, staring in death.</p>
               <p>His men who were less impressionable, removed the valuables and weapons of the
                  defeated, while taking heed to finish those who still breathed.</p>
               <p>The most indefatigable in this latter task was the vindictive Sevalio, who seemed
                  to have conceived the idea of out-heroding Three-fingered Jack.</p>
               <p>The latter, as if that idea had struck him, kept watching him all the time; his
                  piercing sight, rendered more horrible than usual by an accompanying smile of
                  hideousness, followed every movement of his companion; Jack seemed to be finding
                  pleasure in seeing the latter cutting off the heads of the corpses or churning his
                  dagger in the bodies.</p>
               <p>"By the soul of Padre Jurata," swore Garcia, "this night you've robbed me of half
                  my fun, Senor Sevalio, but it doesn't matter so long as you do not become too
                  formidable a rival. When that happens, look out for snakes, old fellow!"</p>
               <p>As he swung in air his flambeau to make it burn better, the light flooded<pb
                     n="98-99" xml:id="VAC8324-00000051"/> both their faces, while Jack darted on
                  Sevalio a glance, half in sardonic sport half in earnest, before he went off to
                  examine more of the fallen with the eagerness of hunting up an acquaintance.</p>
               <p>All the other desperadoes had gone back to the encampment, so that Garcia was
                  alone in his blood-thirstiness on the battle-field.</p>
               <p>Holding the torch in one hand and in the other his knife, he tranquilly pursued
                  his scrutiny lowering the light every few moments to take a closer look at a
                  blood-bespattered visage, when a noise made him glance around and see Sevalio once
                  more.</p>
               <p>"Oh, you is it?" growled Jack. "I thought it was a grizzly who had smelt out the
                  banquet."</p>
               <p>"What keeps you here?" inquired the other, with a grin.</p>
               <p>"Somebody not to be found, I'm afraid."</p>
               <p>"Whom?"</p>
               <p>"Why, the leader of these fools who ran their heads into the lions' jaws. If he's
                  got off this time, I'll have to believe the devil is his friend."</p>
               <p>"The leader of these cursed Yankees is a prisoner in the camp, along with one
                  other."</p>
               <p>"Caramba! who went and spared him?"</p>
               <p>"Murieta; and I came to tell you he wants to see you first thing."</p>
               <p>"Oh, ho! come along! I'm impatient to see the rough customer, who shan't slip me
                  this time as before."</p>
               <p>When the two returned to the gathering, they found the whole band seated around
                  the fires which had been raked together and made again, and rejoicing over the
                  victory so easily purchased.</p>
               <p>Wine was circulating anew and the drinkers were more untiring in disposing of
                  libations than before.</p>
               <p>The two prisoners, bound tightly with the red silk sashes of their captors, were
                  lying on the ground, talking together most bitingly of their conquerors and paying
                  no attention to frequent threats for them to "dry up;" they were trying to hasten
                  their execution.</p>
               <p>"Friend Garcia," began Joaquin, as soon as the three-fingered butcher had thrown
                  himself down at ease on the grass, "I want you and Sevalio to draw lots to see who
                  shall have the pleasure of killing one of these two."</p>
               <p>"Which—the chief?" asked Jack eagerly.</p>
               <p>"No; the other. I mean to keep the principal for a few days."</p>
               <p>"But he may escape," pleaded the Mexican; "I may as well drive the nail into his
                  chest!"</p>
               <p>All laughed, while the speaker drew out his knife, only half cleaned, and fixed
                  his fiery gaze on his enemy.</p>
               <p>"Ha, ha!" cried Arkansaw tauntingly, "who's a-scart? You dassent give a man a fair
                  sight! Bah, you dirty yellow-bellies, you greasers of Satan's kitchen, I'll take
                  any three, any five of you together! There! pah, you cowardly mongrels!"</p>
               <p>"No!" thundered Joaquin, as Garcia offered to spring upon the defier, "I say 'no!'
                  I have my reasons for sparing him; you must wait."</p>
               <p>"Very well, I'll be satisfied with him. Let Sevalio have his own way with the
                  other. I don't feel that way inclined just now, anyhow."</p>
               <p>A low gasp was audible. Sevalio had drawn his knife across the throat of
                  Arkansaw's companion.</p>
               <p>"A simple matter," remarked the slaughterer, returning to sit beside Garcia and
                  halve a bottle with him.</p>
               <p>"Very simple, indeed," added Valenzuela; "nothing could be more simple, but it was
                  done with a relish that friend Jack must appreciate."</p>
               <p>"Now, comrades," cried Antonio suddenly, "let's have one song more. Why, we're all
                  as stupid as gophers in the sierra's snow. Are you asleep, every one of you?"</p>
               <p>The lieutenant's desire was not answered.</p>
               <p>The copious draughts which the human casks had poured into themselves had taken
                  the wits out of all heads, and four-fifths of the troop were sound asleep. The
                  rest were not slow to follow the example, and the feast terminated in a chorus of
                  snoring which the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus might have envied.</p>

                  <p>ARKANSAW DISAPPEARS.—"NO QUESTIONS ASKED."—MURDERS.—THE CHASE.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TEN o'clock in the morning had scarcely come, when Joaquin aroused his men, and
                  ordered them to strike tents and break up camp.</p>
               <p>Although surprised at the sudden resolution and very much preferring a day's rest
                  to activity, all obeyed without hesitation and, before the sun had marked noon,
                  the whole band was leaving Mono Lake behind and proceeding toward Sonora Pass.</p>
               <p>Arkansaw was not with the troop.</p>
               <p>An hour or so before the departure. Three-fingered Jack, who could not let the
                  first opportunity for revenge pass by, had slain, without a word to anybody the
                  man who had promised to defeat him in the previous contest.</p>
               <p>Joaquin gave no token of having noticed his lieutenant's cold-blooded act, for
                  what could be done, short of death, to a man so dreadfully cruel? He preferred to
                  say nothing, and feigned to have forgotten the prisoner.</p>
               <p>In any event, he was not very much distressed at what had happened, though he had
                  reserved the captive for a peculiar tit bit in the way of torture: he meant to
                  make him, after the Indian style, a living target for his men.</p>
               <p>On coming to the south fork of the Tuolumne River, Murieta formed his troop into
                  detachments of twelve or fifteen, which were to go to Arroyo Cantuva by different
                  routes.</p>
               <p>He himself, leading the females to the charge of Antonio and Guerra, selected
                  fifteen stout fellows and took the road for Coulterville, by the south-east.</p>
               <p>On the way from Don Pedro Bar to Snelling's, he fell in with three Frenchmen, two
                  Germans and as many Americans, who were driving pack-mules laden with provisions,
                  blankets and mining tools.</p>
               <p>He did not hesitate to stop them and, while his gang stood ready by his side to
                  shoot at the first word, he strode up to one of the Frenchmen, who did not make
                  use of his firearms, took him by the collar and summoned him to point out where
                  the money-bag was put.</p>
               <p>The man stammered and spoke slowly in order to give his friends the time to offer
                  resistance, which they did gallantly, but the banditti had been too quick for them
                  and shot the three principals who resisted at first fire.</p>
               <p>Joaquin, annoyed at opposition being shown to him, flourished his dagger and
                  threatened to have every one of the survivors' throats cut if they did not
                  immediately turn over their gold to him.</p>
               <p>They resigned themselves to their fate, and, drawing from under the blankets a
                  canvas bag, presented it to the captain, assuring him that it was the sum total of
                  all their exertions.</p>
               <p>The contents amounted to four hundred dollars.</p>
               <p>Murieta continued his journey thereupon, despite the entreaties of Three-fingered
                  Jack, who wanted to finish the German and the French left, and ordered the latter
                  to move on in their own way.</p>
               <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC8324-00000052"/>
               <p>They did not require a renewal of the command, for the very good reason that, if
                  the highwayman had made a more careful examination of their baggage—he would have
                  found six more bags just like the one he had taken, containing in all about
                  five-and-twenty thousand dollars worth of gold dust.</p>
               <p>After this robbery, the committers of it crossed the Merced River at Snelling's,
                  and turned to the east to gain Mariposa. A couple of miles from Mount Ophir,
                  Joaquin was obliged to interfere to prevent Three-fingered Jack from slaying a
                  luckless Chinese, who was so sick and poverty-stricken that the bandit leader was
                  thus affected.</p>
               <p>In a few hours more, they entered Mariposa, two by two, though, for otherwise
                  suspicions would have been excited.</p>
               <p>They stayed there a week, having a good time in spending the booty lately
                  acquired. Then, they left the place, crossed the Mariposa River, and the
                  Chowchilla.</p>
               <p>At ten or twelve miles from Coarse Gold Gulch, four Russian miners were met and
                  killed and robbed.</p>
               <p>Several Indians, who had witnessed the affair, after the departure of those who
                  had taken the lion's share, came in for the pickings and stripped the corpses of
                  their garments.</p>
               <p>Being found some time afterwards in possession of the goods, they were pointed out
                  to some Russians, friends of the murdered, and made to expiate the crime of
                  Murieta and his command.</p>
               <p>The latter had already gone over the San Joaquin, about twenty-five miles above
                  Fort Miller, after having laid over for two or three days at an Indian village for
                  a rest; thence, once again on the march, the morning of the third day had seen
                  them at Arroyo Cantuva, where the majority of their fellows, previously arrived,
                  were completing the putting up of tents.</p>
               <p>Joaquin, set at ease by Arkansaw's death, had decided to dwell once more in the
                  old retreat, more commodious and safer than any other.</p>
               <p>When all was settled in the encampment, the plunderers reposed for a whole
                  fortnight, at the end of which they were started off in more or less numerous
                  bodies and with varied missions to perform.</p>
               <p>It was necessary to obtain money and horses somewhere and also to keep the men
                  employed, while at the same time information and profit were procured.</p>
               <p>Chiefs of such bands of marauders are often placed in the situation of the
                  well-known lottery-player who drew the elephant; if it cannot keep itself, good
                  bye to any peace to the owner.</p>
               <p>When all the divisions were off to accomplish their instructions, Joaquin was left
                  with only a dozen men, among whom figured Antonio, Sevalio and Guerra.</p>
               <p>Murieta and this handful spent a month very agreeably in eating, drinking,
                  sleeping, smoking, making love and hunting in the mountains.</p>
               <p>The rainy season had by this time come on, which, everywhere unpleasant, was
                  peculiarly so in the highlands. Here the captain of ravagers decided to take the
                  field in person and find a site favorable for the execution of the plans on which
                  he had set his mind.</p>
               <p>Two days afterwards, he directed his steps towards the north of the state,
                  accompanied by Sevalio, who was to show him the gold buried by him and his
                  companions on the bank of Feather River.</p>
               <p>After several short halts at Mariposa, Sonora, Murphy's, Mokelumne Hill, Jackson,
                  Dry town, Ragtown and Fiddletown, the leader and his lieutenants arrived at
                  Hangtown.</p>
               <p>They opened performances by the unromantic act of having a good supper in one of
                  the eating-houses; after which Sevalio went away on horseback while his master
                  entered a dance-house, where he was quickly surrounded by some pretty Chilian
                  girls, belonging to the establishment.</p>
               <p>Joaquin carried himself with so much gracefulness and attractiveness that he had
                  many dances with the charmers. When he could believe that he had the right to
                  repose a bit, he went and sat down between a couple of the frail beauties and
                  chatted on all the topics on which such ignorant hirelings could converse.</p>
               <p>The sound of this tri-alogue and the laughter of the woman very soon attracted the
                  attention of all upon the three, and the careless Joaquin recovered some gravity
                  on perceiving that he was examined most scarchingly by some Americans, who seemed
                  to be keeping the door intentionally.</p>
               <p>In a few moments, he recognized in one of them the driver of the stage which he
                  had stopped near White Rock House; for the man's part, the astonishment depicted
                  on every one of his features at such fool hardiness proved that he had known the
                  highwayman again.</p>
               <p>Without "discovering," as chess-language does, the least fear or even mere
                  uneasiness, which would have been ruinous, the robber-king rose with the greatest
                  serenity, wished the girls a good night, rolled his cloak around him and went out.
                  At the door, a hand lightly touched him.</p>
               <p>"Excuse me, sir, but I'd like to see you," said a voice.</p>
               <p>Murieta had already sprang upon his horse, which had been left tied up before the
                  door of the next house.</p>
               <p>"Well, replied he," mimicking the speaker, "you <emph>do</emph> see me, and you
                  ought to be satisfied with having seen me for the last ten minutes."</p>
               <p>And away his spurred horse took him round the first corner. After a swift ride,
                  during which he had got over fifteen miles, he reached Junction House where he put
                  up his steed and spent the whole night, supposing with reason that no chase would
                  be begun of him before morning.</p>
               <p>At peep of day, he galloped off to Taylor's Ranch, with the intention of trading a
                  semi-circle and arriving at Fiddletown in time to meet Sevalio.</p>
               <p>He did not go at a very severe pace now, for he reckoned considerably on the
                  confusion which would be among the Hangtowners. He was passing the ranch when he
                  heard in his rear the hoofs of many horses and caught sight before long of a good
                  number of well-armed horsemen coming after him.</p>
               <p>The one first look was all that was required to inform him what was to be
                  expected.</p>
               <p>He gave the reins to his horse, which flew away as with wings of the wind. The
                  pursuers pressed on, with many an oath of the whites and many a whoop like a
                  redskin, but in this race the Mexican, born in the saddle as one may say, kept his
                  lead. Rejecting his first idea, Joaquin turned abruptly towards the south-east and
                  entered upon the mountainous country, very certain that there the followers could
                  make nothing by superior speed, at least.</p>
               <p>The treacherous nature of the soil rendered his own progress more difficult than
                  he had believed at first. More than once, in toiling up excessively steep ascents,
                  his horse had gone down on its knees, fortunately lightly, and as many times, in
                  descending, it had slid along on its drooped haunches from its hoofs slipping and
                  ploughing up the red clay.</p>
               <p>At the base of one of the hillocks ran a rock-lined gully, in the depths of which
                  rolled a little torrent, on the way to add heaven knows what incalculable
                  treasures in its foam to the American River.</p>
               <p>It was a very dangerous place for the best cavalier on the freshest steed to
                  attempt to traverse and Murieta hesitated to take the leap; but seeing the
                  foremost of his hunters rising on the top of the butte, only a hundred yards from
                  him at the most, be put his horse to it.</p>
               <p>The next instant, he was across.</p>
               <p>A narrow escape, nevertheless, for his horse, which had missed footing on touching
                  the opposite side, staggered on the very brink, damp and slippery, and only
                  recovered itself by an effort which its own dread supplied.</p>
               <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC8324-00000053"/>
               <p>The leader of the chasers tried to follow, but his animal refused the leap, and he
                  had to give it up, as spurs and even a stab with a knife could not overcome its
                  obstinacy.</p>
               <p>His men pulled up at the edge and fired two or three shots a-piece at the unharmed
                  and disappearing Marauder of the Mines.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>OVER mountain and valley land, Joaquin continued to fly until he could feel
                  confident that he was fully out of danger.</p>
               <p>He went through Carson's Pass and on the fourth day came to a miners camp on
                  Walker River, where he passed the night.</p>
               <p>But, fearing to be recognised, he started at daybreak, and by the same time of the
                  following day, came upon a second camp which he fancied belonged to Indians.</p>
               <p>On drawing nearer, he found himself, to his great surprise, in the presence of
                  Valenzuela and Three-fingered Jack, who no more than he expected such a
                  meeting.</p>
               <p>While breakfasting, the chief learnt from them the result of their peregrinations,
                  and how they had chanced to be at the same spot as himself.</p>
               <p>On quitting the Arroyo, Valenzuela had led his company to Weaverville, conforming
                  in that to the orders of Joaquin. Before arriving there, he had sized some horses
                  and had chosen fifteen of his men to conduct them to the allying-place.</p>
               <p>He was then with Garcia and four others.</p>
               <p>Pursued by several rancheroes, the servants of the horse-owners, the six thieves
                  had been compelled to seek safety by crossing, by swimming, a very rapid stream.
                  Hit and disabled by bullets, three of Valenzuela's men had been drowned. Castillo,
                  one of the three left, had managed to reach the opposite shore, but a Missourian
                  had saved him the trouble of proceeding any considerable distance on it, by
                  sending a rifle ball at him.</p>
               <p>In brief Valenzuela and Jack were the only ones who had managed to escape.</p>
               <p>When at Weaverville, Jack had wished to go into a dance-house, notwith standing
                  the objections of the prudent Valenzuela.</p>
               <p>Four men standing up to the bar, were drinking while conversing on the late
                  horse-thefts. One of them had expressed his opinion that Joaquin was no stranger
                  to the affair.</p>
               <p>"To see him and his rascals at the end of the ropes," said he, "I'd change my head
                  for a balloon."</p>
               <p>Garcia placed himself in front of the speaker and said rudely:</p>
               <p>"For a pistol <emph>ball, loon?</emph>" sneered he, "do you mean?"</p>
               <p>"Who in thunder are you?"</p>
               <p>"If you know how to count, that ought to satisfy you," returned the Mexican,
                  holding up his mutilated hand.</p>
               <p>"Three-fingered——"</p>
               <p>"Jack—yes, sir-ree!"</p>
               <p>And, without waiting for more, the speaker drew his knife and plunged it into the
                  man's breast.</p>
               <p>Three or four hands seized him and he and Valenzuela had to fight their way
                  out.</p>
               <p>Their horses had not been touched fortunately and mounting them, they contrived
                  trived to drop their enemies before they came to Beckworth's Pass, and the place
                  where they had just met their superior.</p>
               <p>The next day, the three Mexicans pursued the road to Arroyo Cantuva. They crossed
                  the Sonora range and the Tuolumne at the south fork.</p>
               <p>Dismounting at Rattlesnake Bar, they entered a house and called for supper. It was
                  occupied by an old man, his son and his daughter. The three Mexicans, armed to the
                  teeth, surprised them somewhat, but they said nothing, and the meal demanded was
                  served up promptly by the girl.</p>
               <p>Murieta, who was something of the gentleman for all of his cut-throat and robber's
                  exterior, chatted in the most affable manner with the latter while she gracefully
                  waited upon him and his comrades.</p>
               <p>The old man remarked with suspicion their voracity, but kept his impressions to
                  himself.</p>
               <p>When the repast was over, Valenzuela rose, advanced towards the youth, who had
                  remained in his seat by the fire-place, and taking aim at him with his revolver,
                  asked him with extreme politeness what he had to say against their sacking the
                  house.</p>
               <p>"If you've got any objections to make, speak quick," added he, cocking his weapon
                  playfully.</p>
               <p>"Senor, stay! I didn't know you were robbers!" began the old man.</p>
               <p>He commenced to make such an outery that Three-fingered Jack had to gag him.</p>
               <p>Of course the youth had given his consent to the inevitable pillage, and the whole
                  dwelling was rummaged.</p>
               <p>Only a few hundred dollars were found.</p>
               <p>When about to ride into Weaversville, Joaquin reflected that the imprudence of
                  Garcia might bring difficulties upon him as well as upon Valenzuela, and he
                  resolved to enter the town alone.</p>
               <p>Consequently, he ordered the couple to hurry on in company to the rendezvous,
                  while he himself would remain a couple of days in the residence of one of the
                  members of the band, Juan Berryessa.</p>
               <p>This person had many times furnished excellent news, to members of the active
                  force, and at several other periods had lent them money and horses.</p>
               <p>These services had been generously rewarded by the leader, who considered him as a
                  sincere and faithful friend.</p>
               <p>He was, truth to say, nothing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Without letting it appear, Berryessa had sworn and felt deadly hatred for Joaquin,
                  and had been constantly seeking a good chance to give him up to justice.</p>
               <p>At this very moment, believing that the game was in his hands, he was trying to
                  find more actively than ever a means of consummating his treachery.</p>
               <p>Three or four days had elapsed since the departure of Valenzuela and his mate.</p>
               <p>One evening when Joaquin was visiting the fandangoes in hope of meeting some
                  friend of his, he perceived by accident that his case was empty of its
                  revolver.</p>
               <p>He fancied that the weapon had fallen out and that he had mechanically buttoned
                  the strap over, while habit and the certainty of the cover being in its place, had
                  prevented him doubting the lightness.</p>
               <p>Immediately, he retraced his steps to seek it.</p>
               <p>First, he looked in the stable beside the house to see that his horse was not
                  grudged feed, and then entered by the back door a little room adjoining the
                  kitchen, which had been given to him.</p>
               <p>While he was advancing in the dark and groping for his candle and some matches, he
                  heard voices in conversation in the next chamber.</p>
               <p>One of these was an American, and the other, quite as certainly, his host.</p>
               <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC8324-00000054"/>
               <p>In any other circumstances, Joaquin would have taken no heed of this fact, but his
                  name, distinctly pronounced by both of the dialoguists, and in a tone arguing
                  nothing friendly, set him on the alert.</p>
               <p>Though the idea of "his friend" conspiring against him, had something too absurd
                  in it to attract him, he was naturally anxious to discover the why and wherefore
                  of the utterance of his name, and that motive appeared sufficient to induce him to
                  play the eavesdropper.</p>
               <p>He crossed the kitchen on tip-toe, and glued his ear to the board partition
                  separating this apartments.</p>
               <p>"Yes," Berryessa was saying, "so will my vengeance be satisfied, for he has
                  mortally offended me at various times, either here or in Mexico. Besides, I want
                  money. My losses at 'monte' have forced me to sell my rancho at half its value,
                  and—by the bye, what's the figure out for the bandit?"</p>
               <p>"Well, I can't tell kerzactly. I reckon it's goin' on five thousand, and mebbe
                  nearer ten thousand dollars."</p>
               <p>"Give me one thousand down on the nail to-morrow morning, and you shall have
                  him."</p>
               <p>"But are you right down airnest sartin that it is him. If you kin swear to it, I
                  kin git the sum together jess' as soon as you say—it's a first rate spec. But are
                  you sure?"</p>
               <p>"Why shouldn't I be? I've known him a little too long to be mistaken there."</p>
               <p>"Where is he now? You say a few miles from here—where's that?"</p>
               <p>Joaquin could divine that, during the slight pause that intervened, Berryessa was
                  winking knowingly.</p>
               <p>"Caramba! Am I a greenhorn?"</p>
               <p>"I could take you for an accomplice, one of the band, and have you lynched."</p>
               <p>"Bah! you haven't any proof that I am even speaking to you now!"</p>
               <p>"Very well. I don't keer to fall out with you. If you're willing to give him over
                  to us to-night—"</p>
               <p>"Hold on a <unclear>bit!</unclear> what do you mean by <emph>us?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Jee-rusalem! do you s'pose that I was a goin' to take him single-handed? Ha, ha!
                  No, sir-ree, Number One can't do everything. There will be three of us, and I'll
                  get one of my mates who'll fetch along the money you want."</p>
               <p>"All right, then. That settles it. You pay me that sum, whether he's alive or
                  dead?"</p>
               <p>"To be sure, if you are serious."</p>
               <p>"I am more serious than ever before in my life, and I tell you that, if it haden't
                  been for my bad luck at cards, I would have asked three times as much. It's no
                  child's play, I warn you."</p>
               <p>"You can't skeer me. When and where are we to tackle him?"</p>
               <p>"In this very house, and in a couple of hours, provided you have the cash
                  ready."</p>
               <p>"Never you fear. I will be back before ten minutes, and look upon Mister Walkin as
                  walking out his career to-morrow. Wait for me."</p>
               <p>On these words, the American stalked out, closing the door behind him.</p>
               <p>In another second, Murieta sprang into the room like a wild beast and, his dagger
                  out, he caught Berryessa by the throat, petrifying him by the sudden
                  appearance.</p>
               <p>"Silence!" hissed he when the other tried to speak. "You have spoken your last.
                  So," added he, after a few moments spent in tightening his hold on the wretch's
                  throat, "so you are betraying me for money, and to be revenged! revenged! for
                  what? Haven't I always been your best friend? You sell me for a few ounces of
                  gold, trying to make the buyer believe that you are acting through revenge. Who
                  shall I trust henceforth? Those who like you, wretch, have hitherto shown
                  themselves true and devoted, may turn on me anytime, and give me up to those who
                  want to deck trees with me and my comrades. And you, Berryessa, act this way, when
                  supposed I you most of all incapable of such falseness. Die!"</p>
               <p>He was driving his knife a second time into the traitor's breast when, the door
                  flying open, in walked the partner of the dying man.</p>
               <p>He understood all, and, dropping the bag of gold, he grasped his revolver in its
                  stead.</p>
               <p>"Who are you?" challenged he.</p>
               <p>"I'm the man you bought at that price," replied the robber pointing to the fallen
                  sack.</p>
               <p>"Joaquin? Surrender, or you're a dead man!"</p>
               <p>"Very likely, only life for life! As soon as you fire, I am on you with my
                  knife."</p>
               <p>"I prefer to take you alive, or a lot I'd let you do with your steel. You had
                  better be quick about it, but you can't escape anyway. Two of my mates will be
                  here in two or three minutes. I wasn't going to pay this man you've murdered so
                  much money without witnesses."</p>
               <p>"Murdered? punished."</p>
               <p>"It doesn't matter. Down with your dagger, or I fire!"</p>
               <p>"Fate's against me," said Joaquin, "I see all's up. There, take my only weapon!
                  All I ask is for you to give me up to the authorities and not to the mob."</p>
               <p>"I'm quite willing," said to the other.</p>
               <p>Taking advantage of the moment when the man, who was too full of fair-play himself
                  to suspect treachery, lowered his fire-arm and extended his other hand to receive
                  the weapon, the faithless bandit leaped upon him like a panther, threw him to the
                  floor and pinned him down with a dagger-stroke; then, catching up the revolver and
                  uncocking it as he ran, he glided through his room and out round to the stable.
                  Merely bitting his horse, he mounted bareback and galloped away at the very moment
                  that the friends of the slain American entered the house and room in which lay the
                  two dead bargainers.</p>
               <p>Joaquin was scarcely a mile beyond Mariposa when all the people were in motion and
                  many horsemen put off in pursuit.</p>
               <p>But they exerted themselves all in vain for they could not overtake the chief,
                  especially when he had taken to the mountains.</p>
               <p>Two weeks after this narrow escape from the Judas, Murieta arrived at the main
                  rendezvous, where he found collected almost all who were ranked under his flag,
                  with more than four hundred horses which they had run off from different parts of
                  the state.</p>
               <p>The captain explained the cause of his prolonged absence and hurried into his tent
                  to tell Clarina the same and learn from her whatever information of past events in
                  the camp that she might have to impart to him.</p>
               <p>Among other pieces of news, he was told that one of his connections at San Luis
                  Obispo, called Texas Jack (who is not to be confounded with a rascal of the same
                  name who has had an account of his deserved execution mentioned already by us),
                  had presented himself to the band with two companions.</p>
               <p>These latter were complete strangers, but Jack had gone surety that they were
                  meritorious recruits. They had been out horse-stealing when they had come upon the
                  head-quarters by chance.</p>
               <p>A great number of the troop had been on the point of kicking them out as
                  intruders, and even of killing them as spies; but some who had been acquainted
                  with Jack in Lower California, placed faith in his assertion and so warmly pleaded
                  his cause that life had been granted them until the commander of the desperadoes
                  should have returned.</p>
               <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC8324-00000055"/>
               <p>On learning this, Murieta charged Antonio instantly to bring the prisoners before
                  him. They had been placed under a strong guard in a tent at the south-eastern end
                  of the Arroyo, where they could be in safety but not be mingling with the banditti
                  to learn valuable secrets.</p>

                  <p>TEXAS JACK.—GARCIA JUDGES AND EXECUTES "FOR HIS OWN HAND."—PILLAGE OF THE THREE
                     COUNTIES.—A PIECE OF BRAVADO.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>A FEW words on Texas Jack, an arrant knave.</p>
               <p>In 1836, he was twelve years old. His father, American, went off in the army
                  against Mexico, at the time of the Battle of San Jacinto.</p>
               <p>Jack wanted to be of the expedition, but was refused as being too young. Desirous
                  to prove, like another and inferior Cid, that he could fight as well as anybody
                  thrice his age, he picked a quarrel with an Indian, a friend of his father, killed
                  him, cut off his head and tossed it by the scalplock at his father's feet, when
                  the latter had done chasing Deserter Riley's gang and bestowing leaden favors on
                  guerillas.</p>
               <p>Texas Jack was in San Francisco in '51, in company with the Louisianian called
                  Indian Fred, Bill Flanders, an ex-plug ugly of Baltimore, and a Mexican known as
                  Monty, abbreviation of Montezuma.</p>
               <p>These four had with them a number of horses and mules, of which they had relieved
                  the rancheroes in the valleys of San Joaquin and San Jose. They corralled these in
                  a yard in Mission Street, near Primera Street, and went to a tavern near the old
                  police station.</p>
               <p>In this house lodged several policemen, one of whom was sick a-bed.</p>
               <p>From his room, he heard and recognized the voice of Indian Fred.</p>
               <p>He called him and advised him to leave the city forthwith, as he knew of there
                  being three warrants out for him on heavy charges of theft and that, over and
                  above that, he was looked upon as the principal in a certain murder recently
                  committed in a neighboring county.</p>
               <p>Fred informed Texas of what had happened to him and set out for Stockton, with his
                  two companions.</p>
               <p>Scarcely were they gone than Jack had disposed of the best of the stolen cattle to
                  the hotel-keeper, and the same day he drove them all to the public square and sold
                  them at auction, a deed so bold that it was successful.</p>
               <p>Then he went off some fifteen miles on the Santa Clara Road, entered a ranch where
                  the hotel-keeper had had his new purchase taken, stole him anew and rode off with
                  him to the Mission of San Luis Obispo.</p>
               <p>There it was that he made the acquaintance of Murieta and several of his gang in a
                  house of ill fame kept by one Victor Le Nariss, situated between the Mission and
                  the place where the coast seamen disembark.</p>
               <p>Texas was lucky enough on a certain occasion to render a service to Joaquin by
                  furnishing him with intelligence of some of his pursuers, and the bandit, not to
                  be behind hand in generosity, made him a gift of a magnificent horse, a
                  counterpart, except in sex (for mares are not used for riding by Mexicans), of
                  Dick Turpin's famous Black Bess.</p>
               <p>In the course of his adventures, Jack had fallen into the habit of sleeping, when
                  he camped alone, with his head between the fore-legs of his intelligent steed.</p>
               <p>One night, while he was resting, near San Antonio Creek, he was suddenly awakened
                  by his horse, which was pulling his hair by biting it. He had hardly opened his
                  eyes than he caught sight of three or four persons, half breeds or Mexicans, who
                  were stealthily approaching him with the evident design of killing or robbing
                  him.</p>
               <p>Indeed, he had barely got into the saddle before bullets began to shower upon him,
                  but he escaped, while the horse neighed cunningly as if he rather enjoyed the
                  outwitting of those who had forgotten that thief should not rifle thief, or dog
                  eat dog.</p>
               <p>When he and his companions were led before Joaquin, the latter agreed that his men
                  had been right in sparing them, and he gave them their permission to go their way
                  immediately.</p>
               <p>Several members of the band offered objections and so hotly that Murieta, for fear
                  that the three would be murdered, deemed it proper to have them escorted by
                  Valenzuela, Three-fingered Jack and a couple more, at least half way to the San
                  Joaquin River.</p>
               <p>This party had left the camp behind by some sixteen miles, when Garcia rushed his
                  horse up to one of the three and deliberately blew his brains out with a
                  point-blank discharge. On seeing this, Texas Jack and his remaining comrade
                  clapped spurs to their horses and dashed off as fast as possible to escape the
                  second onslaught of Garcia.</p>
               <p>The latter's two next shots disabled and unhorsed Jack's companion, who however,
                  had a grapple and a fight of much fierceness with the assassin, by which delay,
                  Texas got off.</p>
               <p>Seeing that it was impossible to gain ground upon him, as he was fifty yards away
                  and going three feet to his two, the Mexican delivered the three last barrels'
                  contents on the fugitive and, pulling up, cried:</p>
               <p>"Good luck, old boy! Close shave!"</p>
               <p>With these words, he returned to his friends who, from the very first shot, had
                  dwelt stupefied, and in doubt whether to act for or against the prisoners.</p>
               <p>"It's a pretty piece of work you've done," said Valenzuela, "but I suppose you had
                  the captain's orders."</p>
               <p>"Orders," returned Garcia, charging his six-shooter. "I don't think so. No other
                  orders than you got yourself."</p>
               <p>"What! did you kill those men on your own responsibility?"</p>
               <p>"Why, yes, Caramba! And I'd have settled the third only he 'scaped me, curse
                  him!"</p>
               <p>"What did you do it for?" inquired Valenzuela. "It was useless."</p>
               <p>"Useless! What do you say? useless to kill Americans? I advise you to go back to
                  Mexico and turn monk. Don't faint at blood-spilling. I suppose those men had been
                  let off—"</p>
               <p>"Well?"</p>
               <p>"They would have betrayed us."</p>
               <p>"The captain did not think so. And, as it is, you have let one escape and perhaps
                  made an enemy of him, for, though I have every reason to believe that he has
                  always been our friend, he will believe that Joaquin commanded the treachery."</p>
               <p>"Let him and the captain and you believe whatever you please," growled Jack. "I
                  care as little for one as for the other."</p>
               <p>On the return to camp, good care was taken not to relate what had happened on the
                  road, for the companions of Garcia feared their chief's wrath and they felt that
                  they would be considered as accomplices for not having prevented the bloody
                  assassination.</p>
               <p>A week afterwards, as the month of March, 1853, opened, a series of brigandish
                  exploits commenced, which thrilled the whole country with terror and
                  indignation.</p>
               <p>The outlaws had chosen as the seat of their operations the three richest counties
                  of the Golden Land, to wit: El Dorado Calaveras and Tuolumne,<pb n="108-109"
                     xml:id="VAC8324-00000056"/> and never since the days of the Free Lances, of
                  Alva and of Wallenstein, had an Eden been so swiftly and completely assailed.</p>
               <p>Detached companies of four or five, at most a dozen, had been scattered all over
                  the district and such was the number, the variety and extent of their depredations
                  that the voice of Runner could not enlarge upon them and we cannot find space to
                  record them.</p>
               <p>Ask your friends who were in California then, and they will each have their brace
                  to a dozen of stories to tell, we warrant.</p>
               <p>Theft, murder as atrocious as could be, fires and plundering formed the subject of
                  universal conversation and of much fear. Some of these misdeeds were committed in
                  broadest day, others were shrouded in blackest night, but everybody saw in them
                  the mind or arm of Joaquin. Though the numerous lines and circles of this vast and
                  complex outbreak were greatly divergent, yet, like a cobweb, they all were
                  connected with a common centre, their originator being there watching the result
                  of his weaving.</p>
               <p>There was scarcely a place of any importance in the state which was not
                  unavoidably disgraced by one or two of his secret agents.</p>
               <p>There rarely, or never, were lacking places of shelter to hide wounded and the
                  stolen horses, and there might be named here certain farms, kept by men then quite
                  the thing for honesty and respectability in the eyes—too often misty and webbed—of
                  the world, whereon Joaquin and his associates found help in times of need.</p>
               <p>While marauding all along the road, Murieta and eight of his braves had come upon
                  one of the banks of the Tuolumne in the middle of one of the March nights. The
                  ferryboat was so dextrously fastened to its little <unclear>wharf</unclear> that
                  it was impossible for them to make use of it themselves as they were in the habit
                  of doing.</p>
               <p>They proceeded consequently to the ferryman's house, finding
                     <unclear>him</unclear> so deeply slumbering that the only way to arouse him was
                  to break in the <unclear>door</unclear>.</p>
               <p>He came out frightened, to see what was the matter.</p>
               <p>"We want to cross," replied Joaquin, "but before making the passage, we would like
                  you to lend us all the money you have about you. This may prove to you that no
                  beating about the bush is allowed," added he, displaying his six-shooter under the
                  poor fellow's nose.</p>
               <p>"Put it up," said he, "I will give you all there is."</p>
               <p>He lit a candle and produced a purse containing only a hundred dollars.</p>
               <p>"Come now," growled Three-fingered Jack, who was of the party and who never wanted
                  to miss burning powder, "this won't do. You've got more than this, out with
                  it."</p>
               <p>He would have fired, indeed, but Joaquin ordered him to keep quiet.</p>
               <p>"It is all I have, senor," replied the trembling ferryman.</p>
               <p>"I don't trouble myself about so little," said the chief, with that generosity
                  which is sometimes seen in those who are "flush," "keep it. Take us over to the
                  other side and you shall be paid besides."</p>
               <p>Without any other adventure, and that was scarcely remarkable, the little party
                  arrived in the vicinity of Stocton after a two days' journey, encamping three
                  miles or so out of town under a luxuriant clump of trees.</p>

                  <p>A STORY OF THE 'SCORCHERS' OF FRANCE.—THE PARIS LAWYER AND THE CHIEF OF THE
                     BAND.—FOILED!—DISCOVERED.—THE ATTACK ON THE FARM.—THE FAILURE, FLIGHT AND
                     PURSUIT.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>"COME, Rafael Quintara, let's have a story or a song," said Joaquin's men, as they
                  smoked round the fire, carefully sheltered on the side towards the sleeping town
                  of Stockton.</p>
               <p>"Very well, if it's my turn," replied the bandit, kissing the mouth of his
                  brandy-flask for a moment. "Wait a bit till I think of something. Well, here goes.
                  I heard it from a Frenchman at Guaymas who had been left there sick in Raousset
                  Boulbon's filibustering, and who was a relation of the great French lawyer
                  Berryer. So you may rely on the story being true."</p>
               <p>Some dozen leagues from Chartres, near the Vendomoise country, was a great wood
                  called the Forest of Orgares.</p>
               <p>In its centre were large quarries from which had been taken the immense quantities
                  of stone required to build the magnificent Cathedral of Chartres.</p>
               <p>One day when all the authorities of France had their hands full from the
                  distressed condition of the Republic, for France was in the great Revolution,
                  then, four or five young fellows, having crept into a cavern almost without end to
                  shelter themselves from a storm, began to wonder at the extent of the excavations
                  and the loneliness of the surroundings.</p>
               <p>"Body of me!" cried one, generally nick-named Henry the Handsome, "what a place
                  for a colony of fellows of our kidney!"</p>
               <p>Half a year afterwards, the quarries were the haunt of the vilest and most fearful
                  gallows-birds, under that young man's lead.</p>
               <p>Women were admitted into the band.</p>
               <p>The wretches' most common plan was to pretend to be beggars and stop at nightfall
                  at farm-houses to ask for bread or shelter.</p>
               <p>The moment they could, they would overpower the people in the dwelling.</p>
               <p>If the prisoners refused to tell where was hidden their money—for the farmers had
                  no banks in which to place the proceeds of their produce in those unsettled
                  days—they were bound, and their feet and legs were toasted at great fires until
                  the skin was <emph>scorched</emph> off amid unutterable agony or they acknowledged
                  anything.</p>
               <p>Things rose to such a pitch that, as the wits of the country could not vie with
                  those of the cut-throats, the head department was petitioned to send down some
                  criminal lawyer who would undertake the ferreting out.</p>
               <p>Monsieur Thomas Mereville was selected.</p>
               <p>A sharp December wind was freezing the moisture on the trees and ground, and
                  making very grateful a larg fire that leaped up in the ample chymney-place of the
                  Brothers. All Inn of Saint Maurice.</p>
               <p>The half dozen of the household of the tavern, landlord, cooks and servants with a
                  young and good-looking traveler were listening to the story told by Mr. M.
                  Mereville, as he dried his mud and ice spotted trowser legs at the fire.</p>
               <p>He was addressing a soldier in a captain's uniform who stood near him.</p>
               <p>"You're perfectly right, my dear captain, I was very imprudent," said the lawyer.
                  "I ought to have asked an escort of you as I passed through Chartrain. It was
                  folly that spurred me on. I wanted to get here by dark, but night overtook me when
                  I was all of a league from here. I was a little uneasy but I spurred on my
                  post-horse. Suddenly, without my having had the least warning, a whole troop of
                  men jumped out of the roadside, right and left——</p>
               <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC8324-00000057"/>
               <p>"The Scorchers!" interrupted the landlord's rough voice and his servants' shriller
                  ones.</p>
               <p>"I believe so, my friends," replied the advocate blandly. "One of them shouted:
                  'All right. That's him!' I was pulled off my horse quicker than my smartest clerk
                  can attest a will. I set up a cry, while they handled me rudely. Just then, a
                  gallop of horses behind me, alarmed them, and, after knocking me down with a
                  backhander in the mouth, luckily with a naked fist and not with one of their ugly
                  cudgels, they darted off, with my valise. I think one of them said, as they ran:
                  'I'll see you again!' but I ain't sure. Anyhow, I owe all my salvation, under
                  heaven, to brave Captain Vasseur here present," concluded the lawyer, shaking the
                  officer's hand again with his old wrinkled one.</p>
               <p>"Did one of the Scorchers promise to pay you a visit?" inquired the soft voice of
                  the traveler, who had the look of being a pedler in a fair business. "If he did,
                  sir, be careful; they always keep their word, don't they?"</p>
               <p>"Always," chorussed the assemblage. "Francis is right."</p>
               <p>"And could not the captain catch 'em?" asked Francis, mildly admiring the
                  officer.</p>
               <p>"Sir," replied the latter, taking the look as if he had received many such, as
                  indeed his noble bearing deserved, "I did not see the highwaymen at all. Well for
                  them. The darkness was enough to forbid pursuit, and the thicket was impenetrable.
                  However, I mean to be to horse at dawn, when I will scour the country. Let me only
                  catch one of the wretches to begin with, and I'll answer for the others. It's my
                  opinion, too, that we have more beggars prowling about that even the hard times
                  make necessary. We may have the brigands under our very hands often, without
                  knowing it," said he.</p>
               <p>"So you may, <emph>without knowing it,</emph>" repeated Mr. Francis, while the
                  landlord and his retinue nodded, and left the room to dish up supper.</p>
               <p>The officer went out of the tavern after the meal to see the chief magistrate of
                  the village.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Francis the pedler had made himself quite intimate with the old
                  advocate and had heard nearly a score of anecdotes concerning members of the bar,
                  all of which elevated the narrator into a station which should have been that of
                  the Government Prosecutor. Mereville even invited his new acquaintance into his
                  bedroom, where they chatted by the fire.</p>
               <p>All at once, the man of the blackrobe uttered an exclamation, rose and, with a
                  frightened stare, looked at the single window of the room.</p>
               <p>"A man—a man's face there!" gasped the terrified barrister.</p>
               <p>Francis leaped up and to the place, threw open the four-paned sash and looked on
                  coolly.</p>
               <p>"<emph>To the right. The signal,</emph>" whispered he to a man indeed clinging to
                  the rough outside. "There's not a soul in sight anywhere below, much less there,'
                  added he aloud, returning, "you can see for yourself."</p>
               <p>But the lawyer did not accept the invitation, though he did the assertion.</p>
               <p>"I'm a little affected, I suppose, by the blow that stunned me. I attach too much
                  importance to that villain's threat—mere words, mere words.—"</p>
               <p>"Perhaps," remarked the merchant-pedler; "but, at all events, a good sound sleep
                  will cure you. Good night, will you permit me to say it?"</p>
               <p>"G—good night. Stay. Do you think that this room is s—safe?" stammered the really
                  affrighted man, who had commenced to believe that there was danger in being the
                  open enemy of the formidable Scorcher. "I have papers of value about me—which the
                  robbers did not have time to take—or I wouldn't ask."</p>
               <p>"Certainly!" exclaimed Francis, quite joyful at these last words for some reason
                  or other. "Nothing but a babe in arms could be forced through that window and a
                  ladder would be required even then—it's all of thirty feet to the stable-yard
                  below. The doors are country made, none of your city card-boards, solid oak and
                  plenty of iron. That General Bonaparte who, they say, is dealing the Austrians
                  such hard knocks, couldn't break through that, I warrant. This window in the wall
                  opens on my room, and—unless I give up my honest, if not too profitable profession
                  of selling lace and trinkets, scarfs and ribbons," concluded Francis laughing,
                  "for the black calling of a pillager—you need not fear."</p>
               <p>"Good night."</p>
               <p>All had gone to sleep in the tavern.</p>
               <p>All except Francis.</p>
               <p>When he was convinced of this, he went to his table, for he had laid down and made
                  his bed creak an hour ago as the servant maids passed through the entry to retire
                  up-stairs, and cut his candle cleverly into eight pieces, each small, to be sure,
                  but still able to burn for a brief space.</p>
               <p>Cleverly did he cut hollows round the wicks, and lighted them all set side by side
                  on the windows sill.</p>
               <p>In a few seconds, while they burnt, and while he peered over them out into the
                  gloom, he saw a star spring from the ground, turn a summerset over a tree, and
                  fall. This was done twice more.</p>
               <p>Then, leisurely, he extingushed his little tapers one by one, each end at a time,
                  till, solitary gleam, the central piece burned on.</p>
               <p>Fifteen or twenty minutes passed, Francis had replaced the light on the table,
                  pushed off the bits of melted tallow, and opened the little window.</p>
               <p>He expressed no surprise when a kind of ball appeared on the stable-roofs, rolled
                  down on a dungheap to the walls of the house—while the huge watchdog look on
                  silent and as if enchanted—and began to ascend like a fly, until a man's face was
                  beside Francis's.</p>
               <p>"You, Acrobat the Thumbless?" querried he cautiously.</p>
               <p>"Of course. Who else can climb so fashion?" replied the man with a sort of pride.
                  "Pardon me, captain, for mistaking the other room, and coming be fore the
                  signal."</p>
               <p>"You are fined forty francs a-week for two months," said Francis, sternly.
                  "Silence! no excuses."</p>
               <p>"The seven I had with me are dismissed."</p>
               <p>"That's right. I don't want you either. Tell the band to lie perdu, and all the
                  outlyers to close in. That captain will be up and doing in the morning. Go."</p>
               <p>"Thanks, Captain Henri," said the man, glad—chilled as he was by the icy blast—to
                  accomplish his descent skillfully and disappear.</p>
               <p>The watch-dog let him pass, unchallenged as before.</p>
               <p>(When, long after the trials of the Scorchers took place, one Jean Pierre Folaret,
                     <foreign xml:lang="LAT">alias</foreign> Acrobat the Thumbless, <foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">alias</foreign> the Juggler, was proven to have the secret of
                  preparing a weed called by the peasantry "Our Lady's hair," into a powder, which
                  sprinkled over a man, "charmed" wild and tame beasts.)</p>
               <p>Midnight was come.</p>
               <p>Profound calm weighed upon the house. Outside, the north-wind rattled boughs of
                  trees and jingled the icicles on the swinging signboard.</p>
               <p>The last sound of active life in the next room to the so-called pedler's had been
                  when "boots" had entered to see if the distinguished lawyer had all he
                  required.</p>
               <p>Francis, listening, had heard a chink of money and some low words which he had not
                  been able to make out.</p>
               <p>"If he is buying anything," muttered he, "he can invest in a gravestone and a
                  tomb-wreath with advantage."</p>
               <p>Since then, he had heard the advocate slumber lightly, poorly, and broken in rest
                  by dreams.</p>
               <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC8324-00000058"/>
               <p>His uneven respiration gave token of how impressionable he was and how he had been
                  impressed by the late outrage upon him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mereville was awakened from a vision of his in which he was walking along an
                  alley of which the trees on either side were gibbets adorned with dead, when they
                  all fell in upon him.</p>
               <p>The ghastly forms, the greasy ropes, the hideous beams, descended on him—he tried
                  to shake off the terrying load—one gibbet-arm rested spite of all on his
                  shoulder—he awoke!</p>
               <p>His shoulder was indeed touched.</p>
               <p>He started up convulsively and faltered in a die-away tone:</p>
               <p>"Who—o is that?"</p>
               <p>"Awake at last, M. Mereville," answered a cautious voice. "Very well. We'll have
                  our chat."</p>
               <p>The poor veteran of legal warfare, whose ideas were not in order yet, quickly
                  pulled aside still wider the curtains of the bed to have a look at a person who
                  wanted "to chat" at such an hour.</p>
               <p>The candle burned dimly in its floating bowl in a basin, tremulously reflected on
                  the gloom of the room.</p>
               <p>A man was between him and the light, seated on the chair from which he had
                  unceremoniously brushed the clothes of the man a bed.</p>
               <p>"What! M. Francis, my friend the pedler!" said he.</p>
               <p>"Often that by day," responded the voice deeply, "but by night—now, at all
                  events—Henri the Handsome, with fifty other names, Captain of the Scorchers, at
                  yours and everybody else's service!"</p>
               <p>"Captain of the Scorchers!" reiterated the man of law. "I am lost!" groaned he,
                  falling back on his pillow.</p>
               <p>"Don't speak so loud—you've no witness to bully now," said Henri the chief,
                  severely. "To business. I suspect that you have papers in your possession proving
                  that the Henri Maisonforte who was sentenced for twenty years to the galleys (but
                  who escaped) is illegitimate son of Michel Dralange of Dourdan, and not the lawful
                  one. I must have those proofs and destroy them, for his friends, though they know
                  him a miscreant, must not know he is a bastard! And I want the evidence you have
                  that proves Michel's son to be the same as Maisonforte. And I want all the papers
                  you have concerning my band."</p>
               <p>"But I—I haven't them," moaned the advocate, convulsively writhing in the bed.</p>
               <p>Nor had he, for with a fox's excessive cunning, he had sent "boots" with these
                  very documents to deposit them with the magistrate for surety.</p>
               <p>But he dared not tell the desperate man before him, that.</p>
               <p>"You have them, sir, I am sure. True, they're not in your clothes, or under the
                  pillow, for I have searched. Where are they hidden?"</p>
               <p>"I haven't got them. They were—yes! in the valise that the robbers took from me on
                  the road!"</p>
               <p>"Liar! Those robbers were my rascals, and my own hands opened your valise. Do you
                  not recal my voice? 'Twas I who promised to visit you? I keep my word."</p>
               <p>The lawyer shuddered more than ever.</p>
               <p>"Methinks, Master Lawyer of Paris," sneered Henri the Handsome, "that you have not
                  learnt yet of what I am capable. Let me tell you that you ought to tremble to
                  think of being alone with me in this chamber where you are wholly at my
                  mercy."</p>
               <p>The very excess of his alarm unloosed the man's tongue.</p>
               <p>"I will cry out—and they'll take you—you're alone," half-threatened he.</p>
               <p>"Bah?" returned the chief of the brigands with a scornful laugh. "This whole house
                  is at my mercy, even if I could not handle its whole force singly. I've only to
                  open that window, give a signal and to-morrow's sun will light on smoking ruins
                  and some half-baked carcases."</p>
               <p>Inarticulate and faint moans only came from the lawyer.</p>
               <p>The impatient bandit bent down and said in penetrating accents:</p>
               <p>"Have done, thousand thunders! Where are the papers? I must have them——"</p>
               <p>But vainly did he wait for a word or a movement that would betray the secret-place
                  of the objects of his searches.</p>
               <p>The wretched old man continued to gasp and shiver.</p>
               <p>At the height of fury, Henri the Handsome drew his knife and was about to nail the
                  unfortunate man to his couch, when a suspicion struck him forcibly and
                  suddenly.</p>
               <p>He bent over the lawyer and tore the clothing off his features. Then he beheld
                  that the poor old man, broken by unwonted fatigue of traveling and by the emotions
                  of the late assault (perhaps affected by the blow), was suffering from congestion
                  of the brain.</p>
               <p>His face was puffed out with blood, his eyes rolled awfully, and his tied tongue
                  revealed approaching paralysis.</p>
               <p>The robber leader contemplated the horrid sight placidly, and laughed.</p>
               <p>"A visitation by me? a visitation of God!" said he jestingly; "a real, natural
                  stroke of apoplexy. By the lips of my love this is too much luck for me. You're
                  very kind to get into a fit, my dear lawyer of Paris. On my honor! I was wondering
                  how I should clear myself of suspicion, and not have to take to flight, and here
                  you save me the trouble! If that is Parisian politeness, by heaven! we country
                  folks are clowns!"</p>
               <p>The dreadful word; "apoplexy!" appeared to have reached the already benumbed
                  intelligence of the sufferer, for his speech was thawed by a superhuman effort and
                  he slowly spoke:</p>
               <p>"A doctor—he—lp—bleed me!"</p>
               <p>"I intended to do so, my dear sir," replied Henri, sheathing his knife, "but I
                  can't bear to cut such a friend. I don't mind your making faces—do as you please,
                  while I hunt for the papers."</p>
               <p>Without attending to the tortured man, he scrupulously examined the apartment.</p>
               <p>After having done so and re-searched the lawyer's clothes, which he replaced on
                  the chair carefully, he ruumaged the bed minutely.</p>
               <p>The miserable old man seemed to be past seeing or hearing.</p>
               <p>He did not move, except by a transient spasm, his limbs were too weak.</p>
               <p>At intervals his eyes caught a spark, but were almost extinguished speedily.</p>
               <p>"Sure enough, they are nowhere," said the commander of the Scorchers. "At all
                  events he cannot <emph>tell</emph> all he knows! Things are so so."</p>
               <p>He surveyed the apartment to note if he had disturbed nothing, and, bowing as he
                  took a final mocking look at the living corpse, said with affected politeness
                  while a railing smile sat on his really handsome face:</p>
               <p>"Good night and a long sleep, my friend of the Parisian bar who comes to the
                  country to hunt my Scorchers!"</p>
               <p>On tip-toe of his stocking-feet, he left the room as he had come, that is: through
                  the common window of the two apartments and quietly laid himself down, without
                  hearkening to the groans, fainter and fainter, in the adjoining room.</p>
               <p>A little after breakfast the next morning, Francis the pedler presented himself at
                  the house of the magistrate, M. Peursans, and—being a relation of the official—was
                  admitted instantly.</p>
               <p>The magistrate was at work in his office-room signing papers.</p>
               <p>Francis hastened, when asked the news, to acquaint him with the exciting and sad
                  affair that had happened at the Inn of the Brother-all, that in to say:<pb
                     n="114-115" xml:id="VAC8324-00000059"/> how the great Parisian gentleman of the
                  long robe stopping there, had been frightened into a fit of apoplexy, which had
                  been his death.</p>
               <p>"Very strange, untimely," remarked M. Peursans. "Excuse me a moment till I send
                  Jean to inquire further."</p>
               <p>While he was gone, Henri the Handsome used his fine eyes in a search over the
                  papers on the table and in the pigeon holes over it.</p>
               <p>A morocco pocket-book, which bore the stamp of "Faite a Paris, 22, Rue des Deux
                  Ecus, Alphonse Tirefin et Cie.," attracted his attention.</p>
               <p>What more likely than that was the very thing he wanted.</p>
               <p>That whispered colloquy with the servant of the inn, the money paid! of
                  course.</p>
               <p>Why had he not questioned "boots?"</p>
               <p>This idea, once born, grew into the proportion of a certainty, and, with fixed eye
                  and nervous hand, he contemplated the leather cover.</p>
               <p>Incapable of resisting such a temptation, he had his finger on it, when the
                  magistrate entered.</p>
               <p>"'S death!" exclaimed the latter, "it is just as you say, for Dr. Daniel was
                  passing and he had been at the inn. When the servant entered, after they had to
                  break in the door, you know, M. Mereville was cold. Awful to be struck dead thus,
                  and after he had just escaped the assassin's hand."</p>
               <p>"Amen!" said Francis, thinking of something else.</p>
               <p>There was a silence, during which the magistrate thoughtfully covered several
                  sheets of paper with writing and filled up blanks, while Francis greedily regarded
                  the pocketbook.</p>
               <p>By chance the former looked up and he perceived the object of his gaze.</p>
               <p>He noticed the other's attention but did not understand it.</p>
               <p>"Poor Mereville, it seems as if he had obeyed a presentiment in sending me his
                  papers," said he. "I must assure myself of the nature of his trust."</p>
               <p>He took the leather case, undid the gum elastic fastening (a new idea at that day)
                  and opened it.</p>
               <p>The robber had the notion of snatching it and running off.</p>
               <p>Who could stop him?</p>
               <p>Peursans was no match for him and he could easily slip out of the house.</p>
               <p>But the very consciousness of his power checked him.</p>
               <p>Henri the Handsome liked to brave danger.</p>
               <p>Hence he kept his seat, but instead of preserving the mask of mildness and good
                  humor which he had worn, he let his features assume a more natural exsion of
                  audacity and ferocity.</p>
               <p>His bold look and haughty smile seemed to hint a spirit defying the world.</p>
               <p>The magistrate glanced over the endorsement of several papers, had his wandering
                  vision caught and brought to bear on one especially, read it, read the next, and
                  more with an intense fascination.</p>
               <p>Abruptly he flung a fiery glance on Handsome Henri, who did not stir and only
                  smiled the more proudly.</p>
               <p>He resumed the reading, until, throwing all the documents on the table and leaning
                  towards the cool captain, said:</p>
               <p>"And are you Maisonforte the convict? You must be—you smile! Ah! and did you kill
                  this lawyer! I see, I see! oh, devil—"</p>
               <p>"My dear relative," said the bandit tranquilly, with a stress on the words, "what
                  flea has bitten you? Can you be affected by the death of an old chap whom you
                  never set eyes on?"</p>
               <p>"Use no such trifling, insulting tone, unsuiting your dangerous position," said
                  the magistrate energetically. "I know you now, Maisonforte, escaped from the
                  galleys."</p>
               <p>"And your relative, all the same. The papers prove one just as much as the
                  other."</p>
               <p>"What a shame on our family. But I will do my duty and denounce you as the escaped
                  convict and as the probable murderer of the lawyer."</p>
               <p>"His real murderer, if it comes to that," said Henri, crossing his legs
                  easily.</p>
               <p>"And," continued the authority, as a sudden light broke in on him, "you may be
                  connected with that fearful band, the Scorchers!"</p>
               <p>"The Scorchers follow my lead as the hounds do the huntsman," said the brigand
                  calmly. "But for all that, what can you do?"</p>
               <p>M. Peursans was silent.</p>
               <p>He was alone in the house except a couple of female domestics, he had no weapons,
                  and the chief of the band of Orgares was not the man to be assailed single-handed,
                  as his attitude of confidence sufficiently indicated.</p>
               <p>The responsibility weighing upon him made an icy sweat stard upon his brows.</p>
               <p>Henry the Handsome kept his seat in such a careless way that anybody would have
                  believed him the judge and the magistrate who paced the <unclear>room,</unclear>
                  culprit.</p>
               <p>At last the robber rose and took Peursan's arm.</p>
               <p>"I only ask your company to the door and I'll leave you. You had better make away
                  with those papers when you return, if you know your own good Come."</p>
               <p>"The stupefied magistrate obeyed mechanically.</p>
               <p>They stood at the front door.</p>
               <p>"Wretch, wretch!" burst forth the official as his indignation at length grew past
                  constraint, "how can you tempt me so. Do I not, by calling on you the vengeance of
                  the laws, prove to all that I am a righteous man who holds you in as equal scorn
                  as horror?"</p>
               <p>"Not exactly," hissed the bandit, "Folks will say: 'What a far-seeing kinsman, who
                  waited till rewards were at their height, ere selling his own blood.'"</p>
               <p>This last subtle argument, of which the magistrate felt the truth too clearly,
                  made him desperate.</p>
               <p>He fancied himself already dishonored, lost, ruined, accused of complicity with
                  his crime-stained connection, who had visited him and been closeted with him at
                  all hours and on countless occasions.</p>
               <p>The peril appeared to be unavoidable, whichever way he looked at it.</p>
               <p>His grief was neither mute nor inactive, nevertheless.</p>
               <p>"Off! away, scoundrel! let me never see you more. I keep my promise now, but I
                  will be the first to start in pursuit of you, after twenty hours' grace!"</p>
               <p>Luckily for the speaker, he had strength enough to push the bandit out of the door
                  and slam it to in his face, for the thwarted ruffian—on seeing the barrier put
                  between them so timely—ground his teeth and foamed at the mouth, wildly hammering
                  on the door with fist and foot.</p>
               <p>He called to Peursans in a wrathful voice, but the latter had no such imprudence
                  as to put himself in his power again.</p>
               <p>The maddened chief was not slow to feel the danger in acting so like a maniac.</p>
               <p>He hurried away to the inn, strapped on his back the case of finery which covered
                  his journeys from suspicion, and made for the retreat of his band, threatening and
                  planning as he went.</p>
               <p>That night a large body of men, on foot, were marching out of the heart of the
                  Forest of Orgares to reach the highway conducting to the village of Sair
                  Maurice.</p>
               <p>This part of the wood was within the bounds which Captain Henri had boldly formed
                  as the territory of his band.</p>
               <p>The trees were "blazed" as landmarks and names of him and his lieutenant cut upon
                  them.</p>
               <pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC8324-00000060"/>
               <p>No travelers dared to enter under the shadow of the oaks; few of the peasants were
                  in the outskirts except in broad day.</p>
               <p>Armed forces were often afraid to pass along the grass-grown roads.</p>
               <p>Such a terror did the malefactors spread that they took little pains to conceal
                  themselves.</p>
               <p>It was found out afterwards that the farmers of the vicinity very well knew the
                  real character of the pretended beggars who forced them to be generous in
                  almsgiving.</p>
               <p>They ventured neither to complain or murmur and humbly submitted to the burden,
                  without thinking that they became accomplices in imposing it upon themselves.</p>
               <p>This party of the brigand were going soon to have a fresh proof of the fear that
                  they inspired, and a proof, less welcome, of the fact that human patience and
                  sufferance can be tried too far.</p>
               <p>The miscreants had been more than an hour a-foot and they had become very thirsty,
                  from being so well wrapped up, though in rags outside, against the cold.</p>
               <p>A little refreshment and a slight repose was their desire.</p>
               <p>They stopped on the top of a hill, which was the last elevation of the plain on
                  which was the village of Saint Maurice at the other end.</p>
               <p>Henri the Handsome surveyed the landscape.</p>
               <p>It was gloomy enough, but bright star-light let large objects be
                  distinguished.</p>
               <p>After a moment's gaze, the commander pointed out a large farm-house which rose
                  half way down the hill-side.</p>
               <p>"That's the crib of that old rascal Marchet. Come on," said he laconically.</p>
               <p>They descended thitherward.</p>
               <p>A light shining in the large hall, or main room, told that the people had not
                  retired to rest, despite the advanced hour.</p>
               <p>Beyond a doubt they had caught some rumor of the band going to be "at work" that
                  night, yet nothing betrayed any apprehension on their part.</p>
               <p>They had made no preparations for defence.</p>
               <p>The dogs were chained up, and the big gate was half open.</p>
               <p>Perhaps they feared that the least evidence of shrinking would invite an
                  advance.</p>
               <p>The band strode in boldly, and one or two gave the noses of the watchdogs a tap
                  with a club to make them keep quiet, while Henri the Handsome pushed open the
                  house door.</p>
               <p>The farmer's family and farmhands were forming a half-circle round the fire, while
                  on the long table were the remains of the hearty supper.</p>
               <p>The fire and torches of pine lighted up the place.</p>
               <p>At the entrance of the bandit chief, well known like his followers to the
                  beholders, everybody stopped talking or eating or drinking, as the case might
                  be.</p>
               <p>All the people turned white as ghosts, and some of them rose automatonically to
                  offer their seats.</p>
               <p>Henri the Handsome, with the action of a man pretty sure that anything he did was
                  allowable, stepped up to the table and lifted a cider jug to his lips.</p>
               <p>His fellows imitated his act and cleared the board, without one word, much less an
                  excuse, being addressed.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, beside the old master of the house, there were his two stout sons
                  and four more young men of similar build, who might have given the intruders a
                  busy time of it with their cudgels and the fowling pieces which hung on their
                  hooks.</p>
               <p>The half dozen robust girls of the house and diary were not to be despised in a
                  fight, either.</p>
               <p>But not a soul among them seemed to dream of resistance, but dwelt speechless, and
                  motionless.</p>
               <p>The farmer, at first taken all aback by the unexpected inroad, recovered
                  somewhat.</p>
               <p>With exaggerated politeness, he poured out:</p>
               <p>"Goodness me! it's citizen Henri, and my dear Acrobat the Thumbless—and the Big
                  Norman, and the Doctor, too! Lord! quite a meeting of friends! Sit down, bless me,
                  sit down! eat a drop and drink a slice or two of bread! Here, wife, and you, you
                  staring hussies! look alive, in the name of old Nick stir your stumps, you jades!
                  some ham, clean plates, wine, cider! I'll bet my head that Henri the Handsome and
                  his gan—his friends, I mean, will take a sup of our home-brewed beer!"</p>
               <p>The poor women, jumping up electrified, began to run about at random, without
                  knowing what they did.</p>
               <p>With an imperious wave of the hand, Henri nailed them all to the floor, like
                  statues.</p>
               <p>"Useless. We are expected and cannot stay."</p>
               <p>His companions were finishing more cider.</p>
               <p>"What! going so quick, just like the angels!" said the farmer in an affected
                  regret. "If you are in a hurry, though, Citizen Henri, don't let us detain you
                  with our humble fare. It comes from the heart, though, from the heart."</p>
               <p>Half the band had already stalked out smacking their lips like coachwhips.</p>
               <p>The farmer, seeing he was going to get off cheaply this time, followed the captain
                  and the rest and, like a countryman of those parts, tried to gain something
                  else.</p>
               <p>"I may as well tell you, Doctor," said he to the lieutenant so nicknamed, in an
                  insinuating voice, "that my white cow Blanche is still sick—look in on us and give
                  us a dose for her, that's a kind fellow. You know so many secrets of curing men
                  that you must be able to cure a cow!"</p>
               <p>The Doctor, flattered exceedingly, went out, nodding.</p>
               <p>This promise obtained, Farmer Marchet presumed still further.</p>
               <p>As the last of his unwelcome visiters left, he stood in his doorway, cap in hand,
                  and raised his voice to say loudly:</p>
               <p>"And won't you be so kind, citizen Henri the Handsome, to pass the word for your
                  good people not to take <emph>all</emph> the fowls out of the poultry-house this
                  Christmas week like last! Don't be hard on a neighbor! They only left me one old
                  rooster last year that the fox wouldn't take!"</p>
               <p>The farmer had gone too far.</p>
               <p>"'Sailor Boy,' or whoever's nearest there," cried Henri, "<emph>send that chatter
                     box to sleep.</emph>"</p>
               <p>One of the rear-guard swung his club in the air and knocked the old man into the
                  house, dead as a stone.</p>
               <p>The robbers paid no further attention to him, when suddenly a young man's voice
                  shouted within the doorway as one of the murdered man's sons lifted the
                  corpse:</p>
               <p>"To arms! Close the shutters! We will have help from the soldiers soon. The guns,
                  the guns!"</p>
               <p>The brigands, half out of the court-yard, paused instinctively.</p>
               <p>Bang! went a shot and one of the robbers leaned against the wall; his arm had been
                  broken by the bullet.</p>
               <p>One of the orphan brothers stood in the doorway with the smoking-piece.</p>
               <p>"Back!" yelled Henri, forgetting all at this. "They have brought it on themselves!
                  In, and make mincemeat of them!"</p>
               <p>But the farmhands, having broken the spell, and having strong oaken planks between
                  them and the robbers were not the terrified swains of other days.</p>
               <p>They felt assured that the noise of a conflict would bring them aid soon, for they
                  had seen the numbers of troops pouring into Saint Maurice.</p>
               <p>They were good rabbit hunters, and a man who can hit puss, can easily<pb
                     n="118-119" xml:id="VAC8324-00000061"/> bring down a man, and their four guns
                  killed each their man at the next rush of the brigands.</p>
               <p>The fight was fairly inaugurated.</p>
               <p>One corner of the farmhouse was fired, however, and the flames spread rapidly in
                  the cold dry air.</p>
               <p>At this juncture, there came running up the hill one of the connections of the
                  gang, who had seen the soldiers assembling on the village-square to proceed to the
                  conflagration.</p>
               <p>With a last volley, to which the peasants responded, the foiled bandit called off
                  his men, angry now that he should have let his grander project be thus turued
                  aside.</p>
               <p>They reached the woods before the hussars and foot soldiers came up the hill.</p>
               <p>The latter spent the night in searching for them fruitlessly.</p>
               <p>As the sun set the next day over the quarries, the robbers were assembled in
                  groups in the old haunt, singing, dancing and otherwise making merry.</p>
               <p>They showed no tokens of the previous evening's defeat, unlike their chief who sat
                  apart under a tree.</p>
               <p>As he was sulking and chafing, one of the videttes cried out the "who goes there?"
                  which was repeated by many others.</p>
               <p>A sound approached, and soon grew into a medley of outcries of pain and oaths.</p>
               <p>At length, several men appeared with a burden, which they laid rather gently on
                  the sward.</p>
               <p>"Where is Baptist?" shouted one of the bearers, "where's that rascally doctor?
                  Fetch him along quick for a wounded man?"</p>
               <p>"A wounded man?" repeated Henri the Handsome, aroused from his reverie, "by all
                  the devils, their horns and their hoofs! is no one to have a moment's repose? Who
                  is hurt now?"</p>
               <p>"It looks the very picture of the Big Norman sprawled out there howling like a
                  sick hog," answered the 'Sailor Boy.' "Come on, fellows, and see the fun."</p>
               <p>He ran to the spot with others.</p>
               <p>The chief himself hastened after.</p>
               <p>A few only were too drunk to have any thought except for the dance.</p>
               <p>The Big Norman was indeed extended on the ground, groaning and cursing by
                  turns.</p>
               <p>He had been out with another knave, called the Red-eyed of Borgny, and they had
                  had admittance refused them in a farm-house—for the country people were becoming
                  bold as lions since soldiers were in the district to back them—and had had a gun
                  fired at them, of which the present sufferer had received the charge in his breast
                  and shoulders.</p>
               <p>He was covered with blood and was in great agony.</p>
               <p>The Sailor Boy bent over the sufferer with the joy of satisfied hate.</p>
               <p>"Ha, ha! my poor buck," said he in a delighted tone, "so you're winged at last,
                  you who are so fond of cuffing your comrades! You are pretty far gone, that's a
                  fact! I don't think you'll kick up any more fusses! You're losing your blood, my
                  friend, and if this keeps on, you won't have a single drop in five minutes more.
                  Small loss!"</p>
               <p>The Big Norman was about to put a stop to these taunts by a blow with his huge
                  fist, but a dreadfully poignant twitch in his shoulder prevented him and kept his
                  arm down by his side.</p>
               <p>The Doctor had come by this time, and ordered his patient to be brought nearer the
                  fire for him to examine him.</p>
               <p>He was obeyed.</p>
               <p>The Doctor, taking off the wounded man's coat, opened his box of instruments and
                  searched for the proper probes.</p>
               <p>The captain turned away and had nearly fallen into a new train of reflections,
                  when a loud noise arose in the direction of the fire.</p>
               <p>Laughs and cheers in derision were to be distinguished.</p>
               <p>To the leader's astonishment, the Norman was seen to jump up to his feet and fall
                  half naked upon his teasers.</p>
               <p>The eminent Physician of the Scorchers himself, forgot the importance and dignity
                  of that station and joined in the hilarity.</p>
               <p>"What means all this?" demanded Captain Henri, advancing to the scene.</p>
               <p>"It means, captain," said Sailor Boy after a side-splitting peal of merriment,
                  "that the gun that hit the big baby was only loaded with pepper and salt."</p>
               <p>"The wounds smart," added the Doctor, "but they are mere flea-bites."</p>
               <p>The wounded man was glaring in rage and shame at the circle of merry faces.</p>
               <p>"We'll, never want provisions while we have the Norman in salt!" cried one.</p>
               <p>"A pretty pickle he <emph>is</emph> in," shouted another.</p>
               <p>"Well peppered, indeed!" was the roar of a third.</p>
               <p>"Salted shoulder!" chorussed a dozen.</p>
               <p>"A bucket of water to make him fresh again!"</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, after the chief had silenced the tormentors, he questioned the wounded
                  man.</p>
               <p>"Ha!" said he when he had heard all, "the kid reported that the farmer was to
                  market. Hunt up that boy we call Little Lad (le Petit Garr). I want to see
                  him."</p>
               <p>The youth, one of the spies of the second class, had indeed played false.</p>
               <p>When sent on the errand of finding out all about the farmhouse in question, he had
                  found the traveling too cold and had skulked around in the warmest holes in the
                  quarries till he had pretended to return, and had said the coast was clear.</p>
               <p>"If I go to old Crosspatch's farm," he had reasoned in his childish way. "they'll
                  set the dogs on me. I'll go and hide in the Greenstone Cave and roll rocks for
                  him. Then I'll come back and swear that there's not a soul at the place. They can
                  go and make sure of it themselves, if they like. Curse 'um! they're all the time
                  quarrelling and have made my mother hide herself away off from here. I'll trick
                  'um out of spite."</p>
               <p>This he had done.</p>
               <p>He was soon found, being in the thicket, gnawing a piece of bread, and laughing
                  with the laughers at the Norman.</p>
               <p>It was only when he felt the heavy hand of the Sailor Boy on his shoulder that he
                  began to fear.</p>
               <p>But he uttered no word and offered no resistance to being brought before the
                  chief.</p>
               <p>He, though the youngest and weakest of the band, was too hardened to beatings to
                  be much afraid.</p>
               <p>The captain darted an angry look down on him.</p>
               <p>"You have disobeyed me," said he, "you have lied and you've led to one of my plans
                  being crossed. Do you deny it?"</p>
               <p>The little fellow trembled, but he tried to clear himself by effrontery.</p>
               <p>"Pooh! it was only for the fun of the thing."</p>
               <p>"Ha! do you acknowledge having made a false report about the farm in the
                  hollow?"</p>
               <p>"It was a joke—the Big Norman was only shot with salt!"</p>
               <p>"He might have been slain, as you deserve to be. But you are young and I may spare
                  you. Your mother Fanchette the Tall has disappeared from our midst. Do you know
                  where she is?"</p>
               <p>"No, I don't," replied the boy, affecting stupidity.</p>
               <p>"Come, speak out, or else——"</p>
               <pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC8324-00000062"/>
               <p>The youngster laughed in the speaker's face and made a face so comic that the
                  audacity of it rather than its risibility caused a smile and even a smothered
                  laugh to appear on the faces of the brigands.</p>
               <p>But they were hushed and the boy was alarmed at the possible consequences of his
                  temerity.</p>
               <p>For the handsome face of Henri had grown livid, he uttered a kind of growl and
                  felt in his girdle for a pistol which he cocked.</p>
               <p>The youth twisted himself out of the Sailor Boy's arms, and began nimbly running
                  towards the thicket, screaming:</p>
               <p>"Mother, mother! help!"</p>
               <p>Several of the brigands who might have intercepted his flight, were too much
                  astounded to do so.</p>
               <p>Alone, the bandit chief dashed into the foliage like a tiger infuriated.</p>
               <p>They both disappeared in the shadows.</p>
               <p>Active as was the terrible leader, perhaps he could not have overtaken the child,
                  winged by fright as the latter was, over the rough ground, easier for the lesser
                  than for the greater runner.</p>
               <p>If the former had had the idea of dropping noiselessly behind some bush, he would
                  have escaped the pursuer's wrath for the present at least.</p>
               <p>But as he was in a species of fit, he ran straight on and continued to scream in
                  his shrill voice.</p>
               <p>"Mother, mother! help, help, my mother!"</p>
               <p>The explosion of a firearm resounded in the wood, and was followed by a
                  heart-rending shriek, more powerful than the boy could have uttered.</p>
               <p>In the centre of a natural clearing, lighted by the rising moon which cast a long
                  coffin-shaped beam on the group, Henri the Handsome, his pistol still in his
                  grasp, but the hammer down in the powder-blued pan, was gazing on the boy's body
                  dead at his feet.</p>
               <p>A woman, with disheveled hair and torn garments was kneeling over the corpse,
                  crying:</p>
               <p>"Henri, you have killed <emph>our</emph> son!"</p>
               <p>There she fainted, bathing her face in the blood of the child born in guilt, dead
                  in crime!</p>
               <p>The chilliness of the morning brought her to herself, and she rose benumbed by the
                  night's cold.</p>
               <p>Her mind seemed to have gone on thinking while she had been in the swoon for she
                  was resolved when she awoke.</p>
               <p>She disrobed the body partly, carefully put aside the clothes, and more carefully
                  placed the remains in a hole in the rock which she built over with stones</p>
               <p>On the rude pile she placed a plainly made cross, murmured what she remembered of
                  a prayer over it and stood up, the little packet of clothes in her shawl.</p>
               <p>She looked towards the camp of the Scorchers, felt that a small pocket-pistol was
                  safe in her bosom, and turned away, thinking:</p>
               <p>"I will bid mother good-bye first, and then! then, will I die at <emph>his</emph>
                  feet!"</p>
               <p>She began to thread the crossing paths of the forest.</p>
               <p>But she had miscalculated her forces.</p>
               <p>The hard ground, too, was so unlike the elastic grass of summer that her stiffened
                  limbs soon tired.</p>
               <p>Still she toiled on.</p>
               <p>Her clothes were very scant against such a morning's rigor.</p>
               <p>To add to all, when she had arrived in the more open country, a fine hard snow was
                  falling which pricked the exposed face like so many needles.</p>
               <p>So hard was it that the grains would not adhere to one another like flakes do,
                  and, far from uniformily covering the ground, collected in ridges and heaps.</p>
               <p>On she toiled.</p>
               <p>Captain Vasseur had been out that night, or rather morning, with many of his men,
                  though only two were yet with him, for the news of the robbers having been beaten
                  off the farm and the Big Norman being shot had been received by him and he had
                  thought he might be able to pick up the winged bird.</p>
               <p>He had different luck.</p>
               <p>As the three rode along, they espied coming towards them a countryman, whose
                  three-cornered hat was pulled over his eyes against the sleet, for the riders
                  brought the wind with them.</p>
               <p>When they first descried him, he was a mere black speck on the white.</p>
               <p>But as soon as he caught sight of the horsemen, which happened after a while, he
                  had not appear to be in any hurry to make their acquaintance, for he stopped and,
                  after a look, dropped behind a hillock, perhaps trusting that he had not been
                  remarked.</p>
               <p>But Captain Vasseur had observed this suspicious proceeding.</p>
               <p>"Spur!" ordered he.</p>
               <p>Off the three went at a fast trot.</p>
               <p>Seeing himself discovered, the suspected man rose and cut across the fields to
                  throw the mounted men off his track.</p>
               <p>"Keep on his heels," commanded the officer; "I'll remain in the road and prevent
                  him taking to it again, as he may."</p>
               <p>As he rode along, he suddenly perceived a kind of dark blot in the middle of the
                  highway on ahead.</p>
               <p>It was a woman lying motionless and half covered with the drift of icy
                  particles.</p>
               <p>He reined in.</p>
               <p>"Halloa! are you asleep, my good woman!"</p>
               <p>Finding no signs of life, he dismounted and acquired certainty that the poor woman
                  was senseless and in a fair way to lose life.</p>
               <p>She presented a wretched aspect: her feet torn through her tattered shoes, bled
                  slowly upon the ice; her walking-stick had fallen from her one hand, while the
                  other and its arm stiffly encircled a small bundle.</p>
               <p>The sleet did not melt on her face or form.</p>
               <p>By temperament as well as by profession, Captain Vasseur was not easily affected,
                  yet he could not help great compassion moving him on beholding the poor creature's
                  deplorable condition.</p>
               <p>He leaned over her with interest, shook her and called her in vain.</p>
               <p>She did once open her eyelids the least bit, but almost instantly closed them in
                  that slumber of death by cold.</p>
               <p>As the officer knew now that she breathed still, he hastened to wrap her up in his
                  ample riding-cloak, and forced a few drops of brandy between her set teeth.</p>
               <p>He alone, and there, could not altogether accomplish the resuscitation.</p>
               <p>He looked around him.</p>
               <p>His companions were far off, still pursuing the three-cornered hat.</p>
               <p>Besides, they would not have been of any utility under the circumstances.</p>
               <p>Fortunately, not very distant from the spot, was a little cabin hidden in the
                  leafless brush, yet denoted by the smoke curling out of the chimney.</p>
               <p>Its ragged straw thatch indicated no great wealth, but Vasseur did not hesitate to
                  take up the unconscious woman and stride up to the cottage, as rapidly as his
                  heavy boots with his spurs would let him.</p>
               <p>His horse followed him like the well-trained steed he was.</p>
               <p>The house was very comfortable, after all, on a nearer view.</p>
               <p>The garden had been well under cultivation.</p>
               <p>Beehives were carefully sheltered by a wall, a goat, tied up, was bleating and a
                  cow was bellowing in the stable.</p>
               <pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC8324-00000063"/>
               <p>Vasseur tied up his horse to the palings and walked into the cottage without
                  knocking.</p>
               <p>An old woman was within slowly turning a spinning-wheel.</p>
               <p>On seeing what had happened and being instructed by the officer's sharp words, she
                  sprang up and cheerfully enlarged the fire, made a hot posset of wine.</p>
               <p>On coming to chafe and warm the poor woman's hands, she uttered a loud scream
                  which astonished the captain.</p>
               <p>"Fanchette, Fanchette! Good heavens, my daughter!" cried she, falling on her
                  knees, "She was dying, and you bring her to me, to me! How strange! See, she's
                  coming to—she opens her eyes!" continued the old woman. "She lives!"</p>
               <p>In fact, Fanchette's features lost their pallor by degrees and she became more and
                  more animated.</p>
               <p>But there was a fear that the sudden reaction would give her a fever.</p>
               <p>They put her to bed with all the blankets on her.</p>
               <p>The captain had meantime examined the bundle, which contained a boy's clothes.</p>
               <p>He believed for a moment that they had been stolen, poor as they were, when a weak
                  voice raved from under the coverings:</p>
               <p>"My boy, my son! where are you? Oh, he killed him because he would not steal!"</p>
               <p>These words, betokening a return of sense but not of command over the brain,
                  struck the mother with alarm and the officer with suspicion and amazement.</p>
               <p>"She's mad! she's mad!" cried the old woman quickly. "Her boy died long ago when a
                  babe."</p>
               <p>But Franchette had sat up and looking at Captain Vasseur turning over the contents
                  of the bundle, said earnestly.</p>
               <p>"Please, please don't touch 'em, sir. They're all that's left of my good little
                  child!"</p>
               <p>"The deuce! Ha! a babe wear the clothes of a boy of twelve!" cried Vasseur.</p>
               <p>What he would next have done is doubtful, but whatever his intended move, he was
                  interrupted by hasty footfalls heard outside.</p>
               <p>The back door of the cottage opened, and in rushed a man, with just enough breath
                  to gasp:</p>
               <p>"Kind folks, I am hunted. Don't give me up!"</p>
               <p>Vasseur promptly caught him by the collar and said:</p>
               <p>"One moment, my man. I want a talk with you."</p>
               <p>Nothing could equal the stupor of the stranger on perceiving his leap from the
                  frying-pan into the fire.</p>
               <p>But he tried to escape nevertheless.</p>
               <p>The officer's hold was too good and his hand too strong for that to be
                  accomplished.</p>
               <p>The Red-Eyed of Borgny, for this was the companion of the Big Norman found that
                  cunning was his only resource.</p>
               <p>He sat down on a stool beside the captain with affected resignation.</p>
               <p>"Good heavens! citizen officer, what can you want with me, hunting me over the
                  country as you have. I am a poor inoffensive soul, who cannot guess why I am so
                  troubled. Here's my paper."</p>
               <p>He handed Vasseur a greasy scrip, which the latter scarcely deigned a glance.</p>
               <p>"Oh, I suppose it's all right, my good Germain Bouscant, otherwise the Red-Eyed of
                  Borgny, who called at the farm in the hollow last night along with a gigantic
                  knave."</p>
               <p>The start of the rogue at this abrupt accusal confirmed its truth.</p>
               <p>"Look here, sirrah, your sudden flight at sight of your uniforms is proof enough
                  for your being guilty, your character apart of vagabond, beggar and what not. So I
                  cannot let you go——"</p>
               <p>"But I am innocent as a lamb."</p>
               <p>"I arrest you in the name of the Law. It will be better for you," said the
                  captain, fixing his penetrative eyes on his shuddering prisoner, "to cease your
                  useless lies and lamentations and gain the indulgence of the authorities by making
                  a clean breast of it. The government is stirring at last. The National Guard is
                  arming, and the regulars are coming in from all quarters. There's no hope for the
                  Scorchers."</p>
               <p>The brigand was shaken, for he knew this was true.</p>
               <p>"They are lost. The first ones who come in will be granted life, however guilty
                  they may have been. Besides, a reward will be added to whoever tells who is the
                  skilful chief of the band."</p>
               <p>"A reward?" exclaimed the Red-Eyed.</p>
               <p>"A considerable sum."</p>
               <p>The brigand was convinced, and he was about opening his mouth, when he was
                  interrupted by a woman's voice.</p>
               <p>"Traitor! coward! liar! woe to you if you sell <emph>him!</emph>"</p>
               <p>The brigand looked at the bed.</p>
               <p>"Hullo! Franchette the Tall! and her mother Old Caduque! What does this mean?"</p>
               <p>"It means that you had better be quick, or others will forestall you,"
                  interpolated the officer quickly.</p>
               <p>"No, no, he lies!" screamed Franchette, struggling with her wrappings and her
                  mother. "I won't betray <emph>him!</emph> He has led to all my shame and agony! he
                  hates me and has killed my boy! but I won't betray him, and won't have anybody
                  else do it! I have loved him and love him still!"</p>
               <p>"You speak of a murdered child," said Captain Vasseur, "avenge him by——"</p>
               <p>"Peace! Cut me in bits—you shall not know <emph>him.</emph> My poor, poor little
                  one!"</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, Germain had come to the conclusion that Franchette would let out the
                  secret in her ravings, if not wittingly, determined on his course.</p>
               <p>"My word of honor for what I promise," said the officer.</p>
               <p>"Well, then," began the traitor, "I will reveal all about our association. To
                  begin with and to prove my knowledge, the leader, the Chief of the Scorchers is
                  known to us as Henri the Handsome, to the world as——"</p>
               <p>A sharp crack of a pistol echoed in the room, and the speaker, with one eye
                  sightless, for therein the tiny bullet had buried itself, fell into the officer's
                  arms, dead.</p>
               <p>The smoke filled the room.</p>
               <p>There was a contused moment.</p>
               <p>Captain Vasseur made a spring to seize the slayer, but it was the old mother and
                  not Fanchette that he grasped.</p>
               <p>The door opened and a cold blast rushed in while the mistress of the bandit leader
                  flew out.</p>
               <p>In another moment, a clatter of hoofs were audible.</p>
               <p>"The devil!" thundered the officer, flinging from him the old woman, who rolled
                  over the dead traitor.</p>
               <p>And he dashed into the open air.</p>
               <p>On one side approached his two soldiers; on the other disappeared, on her horse,
                  the fevered Fanchette, riding at full speed.</p>
               <p>"No use chasing!" said he, seeing that she was country-girl enough to have
                  acquired tolerable horsemanship. "Give me your horse, Bandoni, while you arrest an
                  old woman inside this house and see if a man is dead."</p>
               <p>The man was dead.</p>
               <pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC8324-00000064"/>
               <p>But if he was not to reveal the important secrets, another took his place.</p>
               <p>Old Caduque, on promise of mercy being extended to her child, began to make known
                  her acquaintance with the band of Orgares, as she rode in front of the
                  captain.</p>
               <p>The chase was really begun at this moment.</p>
               <p>Darkness was again upon the forest.</p>
               <p>Its edge was being penetrated by a large body of soldiers, horse and foot, under
                  command of Captain Vasseur, who guided his little army in accordance with what he
                  had learnt from Old Caduque.</p>
               <p>It was a difficult task, and many a time he had almost given it up.</p>
               <p>But at last, the appearance of a changing red glimmer gave all heart.</p>
               <p>"The fire of the wretches' camp," said he, aloud. "Cautious, now, men! The curses
                  of all honest men befal him who is hindmost at this pinch!"</p>
               <p>The brigands were in their great cavern, on account of the cold.</p>
               <p>A fire burned before its large mouth to heat the air that entered it.</p>
               <p>They were all up and excitement, for not only had the news that Fanchette had
                  brought on the stolen horse been confirmed by spies, but the last arrival had told
                  of the approaching army, and of the complete confession of Old Caduque.</p>
               <p>Fanchette was pardoned by the chief for her services and she had gone to sleep in
                  a corner, almost happy.</p>
               <p>The fright of the villains knew no bounds.</p>
               <p>They would have rushed out of the cave, but that Captain Henri stood between them
                  and the aperture.</p>
               <p>"Let none of ye stir!" said he, growling in rage. "You're a pack of cowards! Do
                  you dare go against your leader's will?"</p>
               <p>He drew a brace of pistols.</p>
               <p>"I'll unroof the skull of the first who rebels!"</p>
               <p>He thought they were more of soldiers; they were mere cut-throats.</p>
               <p>His attitude silenced their murmurings, and he endeavored to overawe or decide
                  them again.</p>
               <p>But they were listening not to him, but to the tramp of armed men which they
                  fancied they heard.</p>
               <p>Time was too precious for such hesitation to be prolonged.</p>
               <p>As the commander paused, exhausted by his own vehemence, Sailor Boy made himself
                  spokesman and began:</p>
               <p>"Let us go, captain! You see we're a demoralized set! We'll be nabbed at a swoop
                  with all this palaver."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes! aye, aye! speak to him, Sailor!" vociferated the farthermost of the
                  crowd.</p>
               <p>"But <emph>I</emph> will not have you scatter like thistle-seed! Am I not your
                  chief?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, that's all bosh—our gang's broken up," returned Sailor Boy, emboldened by the
                  nudges and pattings on the shoulder that he received. "Come now, stash that! our
                  lives go ahead of our laws!"</p>
               <p>"Hur—!" they began to cheer.</p>
               <p>But Henri's voice broke in.</p>
               <p>"By all the horns of the devil, here you go on a voyage, my Sailor Boy!"</p>
               <p>His pistol shot tore the ear of the rebel, and entered the throat of the man
                  behind him.</p>
               <p>The brigand chief, changed his exploded weapon for the other, but he was not let
                  use it.</p>
               <p>They rushed upon him altogether and upset him in a twinkling, notwithstanding the
                  increase of his natural powers by fury.</p>
               <p>A blanket was spread over his face to prevent him seeing who were the principals
                  in the revolution of time-honored authority and many hands held him down.</p>
               <p>He struggled fruitlessly.</p>
               <p>At length, he felt the many grasps relax and be removed out he was bound hand and
                  foot with ropes.</p>
               <p>His assailants were moving away.</p>
               <p>He attempted to break free, but unsuccessfully.</p>
               <p>In a little while, a small hand impatiently cut his bonds and pulled off the cloth
                  blindfolding him.</p>
               <p>It was Fanchette.</p>
               <p>He paid little attention to her, for his rage overcame his gratitude.</p>
               <p>The pistol which he had not fired off, lay on the ground, as if no one had dared
                  to touch it.</p>
               <p>He caught it up, rushed through the opening and leaped over the dying fire.</p>
               <p>Only a few boys and old women were in the neighborhood, and they were unworthy of
                  his vengeance.</p>
               <p>"Henri, Henri!" screamed Fanchette, "what are you going to do?"</p>
               <p>But he had seen his men running off or mounting stolen horses which they had taken
                  out of the stable-cave.</p>
               <p>"Cowards! only wait!" roared he more like a wild beast than a human being.</p>
               <p>"The chief!" exclaimed the Sailor Boy in terror. "Confound whoever let him
                  loose!"</p>
               <p>Off they spurred, the shot following them uselessly.</p>
               <p>All of a sudden, like echoes to that report, detonations broke the stillness on
                  several sides of the wood.</p>
               <p>After a few minutes, some of the bandit on foot began to return to the haunt,
                  while the musketry began to rattle.</p>
               <p>The soldiers had surrounded the wood.</p>
               <p>Henri the Handsome thought no longer of punishing the rebels, who, indeed, were
                  being summarily dealt with.</p>
               <p>He grasped Fanchett's hand and the two pushed through the underwood, as Captain
                  Vasseur and his men beat back the robbers in all quarters.</p>
               <p>The two fugitives managed to get through the lines and left the spot by some
                  yards, when three soldiers started up before them.</p>
               <p>"Halt!" cried one. "A move, and you die!"</p>
               <p>The brigand chief stopped but almost instantly sprang forward.</p>
               <p>The piece flashed in the pan.</p>
               <p>He was only a few feet from the soldier, who attempted to club his musket, but
                  Henri was too close and had him by the hair.</p>
               <p>He bent back his head and was about to cut his throat, when the other soldiers
                  fired at him.</p>
               <p>One bullet missed him, the other only went through and through the cords between
                  the shoulder and the neck and then struck Fanchette in the bosom, as she came on
                  to save her lover.</p>
               <p>"I forgive—Henri! my ch—"</p>
               <p>She breathed her last as the soldiers pinioned their prisoner.</p>
               <p>They let her lie there while they led their captives to their commander.</p>
               <p>The open space in front of the cave lighted up by the fire which had been
                  replenished, was full of dead, dying, and bound bandits, over whom the soldiers
                  stood triumphant guard. As soon as Henri the Handsome could get speech, he begged
                  Captain Vasseur te let him see Peursans the magistrate.</p>
               <p>"Here he is," said the officer coldly.</p>
               <p>"What does the <emph>prisoner</emph> want?" inquired the magistrate equally
                  icily.</p>
               <p>"A word in private," answered Henri, downcast considerably by this manner.</p>
               <p>"What?" said the bandit chief, turning pale.</p>
               <p>"I am a nobody at present," returned the magistrate, turning away. "Captain
                  Vasseur is about to take you to Chartres."</p>
               <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC8324-00000065"/>
               <p>"Not till I repay your affection, kinsman of mine!" cried Henri the Handsome with
                  a return of his daring voice of old.</p>
               <p>By strength as well as by a trick well known by galley slaves, the speaker had
                  freed his hands and drawn from his clothes a little needle of a dagger which he
                  had known how to conceal from his searchers.</p>
               <p>But his feet were hampered and—though Peursans was unsuspicious—Captain Vasseur
                  had been on the alert. In an instant, the brigand was overpowered and
                  disarmed.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding the thinning out by jail fever which visited the numerous
                  culprits, and several escapes, eighty shot was the number of the Band of Scorchers
                  brought to trial and to sentence of death and imprisonment.</p>
               <p>Of the twenty-three who were adjudged to the extreme penalty, the chief was
                  naturally the foremost.</p>
               <p>He died "handsomely," as the French criminals who envy his daring life, Jestingly
                  say to this day.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>TURN PIRATE.—SAN FRANCISCO.—HOW GARCIA SPENT HIS TIME.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ONE Sunday morning, very fine, as the bells were calling Catholics to mass and the
                  no-religionists to amusements, and the men, generally fresh shaven and in their
                  "store-clothes," were mustering at the corners to watch the women pass and
                  criticise feet and ankles, they saw a man go by who was a stranger.</p>
               <p>He was a good-looking young man of black eyes and hair, which floated down his
                  shoulders. He rode along tranquilly, regarding with indifference even such things
                  as demanded inspection. He was so richly attired, and bestrode a horse so good and
                  so elegantly bedecked that he was the cynosure ere long of all eyes and the
                  subject of general remarks.</p>
               <p>"Handsome! Look at him!" murmured the ladies. "Some young Mexican noble! General
                  Vallejo's son! No, the general has no son."</p>
               <p>"I swear! he is gallus!" said a New Yorker.</p>
               <p>"I reckon that chap will dew!" remarked a Bay State man.</p>
               <p>"Thunder! couldn't shine more if he had a plantation to back him!" observed a
                  Southerner.</p>
               <p>The young horseman, apparently unconscious of having drawn all eyes upon him, drew
                  rein suddenly on passing before a board fence on which were posted several
                  handbills. One of them, more prominent than the others of "Great Bargains! New
                  York Goods at Cost! French Silk Scarfs, all colors!" was thus lettered: <q>
                     <p>$5,000.—REWARD.—$5,000.<lb/> Five thousand dollars Reward to whoever
                        delivers to the authorities,<lb/> JOAQUIN,<lb/> DEAD OR ALIVE!</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The Mexican cavalier had no sooner read this than he leaped off his horse, drew
                  out a lead pencil, scribbled rather leisurely some words on the foot of the bill
                  and rode on as quietly as if he had not stopped. A dozen people, urged by
                  curiosity, hastened up to the fence to see what had been written, and they
                  read:</p>
               <q>
                  <floatingText>

                        <div type="letter">

                              <signed>JOAQUIN."</signed>

               </q>
               <p>Fancy the exclamations of astonishment which hailed this sight. Nothing was spoken
                  about throughout the week except this event, at least among the ladies.</p>
               <p>Every one of them had remarked, "a something, my dear, about his eyes," that was
                  suspicious, and according to their account, as they had known Joaquin from the
                  first, he owed his safety to a silence not generally classed with their gifts.</p>
               <p>The daredevil freak in which the outlaw had indulged, did not prevent him
                  returning to the town every now and then in different disguises, to learn
                  personally what was going on.</p>
               <p>He found out one evening that a little craft was going to leave Stockton for San
                  Francisco, at a certain hour.</p>
               <p>A couple of miners from Campo Seco in Calaveras County, were the passengers,
                  bearing with them the gold which they purposed enjoying in the States.</p>
               <p>Joaquin took with him three of his men whom he found roving about the city and,
                  getting into a small boat, they shoved off and proceeded to hide themselves in the
                  tule rushes under one bank.</p>
               <p>The musquitoes were so plaguing that it almost made him give up the plan but, on
                  reflecting, the perspective of a magnificent gain made him persevere in his
                  original idea.</p>
               <p>He regretted that none of them had brought matches, for then they might have
                  kindled a fire to drive off the gallinippers, and he was on the point of flashing
                  some powder and thus procuring fire when the fear of the flames being descried,
                  annulled that scheme.</p>
               <p>Three long, long hours crawled by.</p>
               <p>At length, they espied the sloop, which, very crank, leaned over daintily and
                  brushed the ripple gently though rapidly.</p>
               <p>When she had approached the ambush, on which she nearly bore during a tack, the
                  waiters pushed out, reached the side of the vessel just when her crew of two were
                  busy holding the helm and foresheet respectively when she went about, and fired at
                  them.</p>
               <p>They dropped disabled or dead, on the deck.</p>
               <p>At the ominous sounds of the detonation and of the double fall, the two passengers
                  rushed out of the little cabin, weapon in hand.</p>
               <p>But the conflict was unequal.</p>
               <p>The six shots rang out almost together, two of Joaquin's men were slain, but three
                  bullets entered one of the miners and another the other, and they breathed their
                  last.</p>
               <p>Joaquin and his surviving comrade relieved the corpses of their belts of gold and
                  valuables, and, finding some matches in the cabin, set fire to the sloop, after
                  lashing fast the helm and letting the sails down by the run.</p>
               <p>When the morning came, there was no trace of the crime to speak of; a scorched
                  hulk lay at the bottom of the stream and the earth began to cake up against it to
                  form another bar, some tinder had been blown into the woods and even kindled a
                  pitchy bough here and there, some rope twined and lashed about in the eddy, and
                  bits of wood, a sweep and a water-breaker bobbed up and down on the current, and
                  that was all.</p>
               <p>Twelve thousand dollars was in the hands of the robbers.</p>
               <p>On the next day, after having sent Three-fingered Jack to the head-quarters with
                  four more men, Murieta took Valenzuela with him to Sacramento.</p>
               <p>They stayed there about a week before sailing to San Francisco, where they arrived
                  at about eleven in the evening.</p>
               <p>They slashed through the bad streets and gloom, until they had come to a house in
                  Pacific Street near Dupont.</p>
               <p>At the door they thundered for all of a quarter of an hour, when it was opened a
                  little.</p>
               <p>"Who is there?" whispered a voice.</p>
               <p>"Friends, Senor Blanco," was the reply, "good friends, too!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I recognize you, my paysanos," returned the voice; "come in, come in! I've
                  been expecting you some time!"</p>
               <pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC8324-00000066"/>
               <p>"You don't say?" queried Valenzuela, entering after his superior, while Senor
                  Blanco closed the door behind them and carefully fastened it. "How could you be
                  expecting us when you are no magician to see into the future."</p>
               <p>"Unless you have had a visit of Old Nick from Monte Diablo yonder," added
                  Joaquin.</p>
               <p>"No, no, nothing of that sort. My information came from no other devi than one of
                  your company. Come along and I will show you the man himself, though I hardly
                  think he will recognize you as easily, for he has been dead drunk during the last
                  forty-eight hours. A rough customer he is! When I heard you knock, I thought you
                  were the enemy and I made a shift to arouse him, which kept you waiting so
                  long."</p>
               <p>"Very well; but who is this man of ours?" inquired the captain.</p>
               <p>"Come and see for yourselves," answered Blanco. "This way—here we are. Here's the
                  door! I ain't surprised that you don't know my house when you have not been here
                  for so long. It has been burnt down since then, too, but I had it rebuilt pretty
                  nearly the same way. There's the man now!"</p>
               <p>Joaquin and his lieutenant had entered a rather large room. They stopped and
                  looked around.</p>
               <p>"Where?"</p>
               <p>"Why, on the floor."</p>
               <p>The captain took the lamp off the table and held it over a recumbent form.</p>
               <p>"It's Garcia! he here!" exclaimed he, starting back.</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Blanco. "He told me that you ordered him to go to the main
                  rendezvous, but as he had some money in his pocket he came here to go on the
                  'tear.'"</p>
               <p>"Let's see if he cannot be awakened," said Valenzuela.</p>
               <p>He went up to the drunkard and gave him sundry shoves and blows which, far from
                  producing the anticipated effect, only drew from the three-fingered cut-throat
                  deep growls and broken oaths! "<hi rend="i"/>Cara—or <hi rend="i"/>Caram—"</p>
               <p>Knowing that watching Garcia was out of the question, and yet fearing, if his
                  actions were not circumscribed that he would compromise them, Joaquin took the
                  course of avoiding him as much as was possible while he should be in the city.</p>
               <p>For this purpose, he bought a tent and put it up on one of the hillocks not far
                  from the Fremont House, near Battery and Vallejo Streets.</p>
               <p>Every night, he and Valenzuela left their retreat to go the rounds of the Bella
                  Union, Diana, El Dorado and other exhibition-places of the tiger to be fought.
                  They lost and won piles of gold with a calmness and good humor even which
                  delighted the lookers-on, players or mere "lunchers" on the spread side-boards,
                  and the bankers themselves, who are not, as everybody knows who has tilted on the
                  field of the cloth of green, the most impressionable of men.</p>
               <p>One evening as the pair were sauntering into the Bella Union, and about to take
                  seats at a faro-table, their attention was suddenly drawn to another table, round
                  which were packing a great number of the curious to see an interesting game of
                  monte. They stepped over to it, too, and beheld Mr. Mannet Garcia, otherwise
                  Three-fingered Jack, facing them, with five or six thousand dollars before
                  him.</p>
               <p>He had just lost about the same sum, and the banker was unconcernedly shuffling
                  the cards for a fresh game.</p>
               <p>Out came a king and a deuce which he placed side by side on the board.</p>
               <p>Jack, without hesitation, staked all he had on the court card. The dealer
                  continued to throw out the cards, and took in the two-spot; in a few seconds all
                  was over.</p>
               <p>The rake encircled and pulled away the pile of gold before the player, without the
                  least symptom of a smile appearing on the banker's cheek.</p>
               <p>Nor did the loser express any more emotion. He called for a glass of brandy,
                  swallowed it down to the last two drops and went out of the saloon without having
                  spoken a word.</p>
               <p>The captain and his companion had not been remarked by him.</p>
               <p>They remained an hour or so in the place, going from table to table, losing a good
                  deal here, winning a very little there, and had no adventure.</p>
               <p>Then they proceeded to Jackson Street, to a Mexican ball where they found a large
                  assemblage of their countrymen and women, who were bobbing up and down in an
                  atmosphere of smoke and dust, to the jingling and thumping of a tamborine, to the
                  scraping of a fiddle and the screak of a cracked flute.</p>
               <p>They mingled with the throng and passed some time there.</p>
               <p>It was a little after two in the morning when the two bandits quitted the barroom
                  to return to their canvas domicile. Joaquin had lost at play so large a sum that
                  his comrade and himself could only find on them a hundred dollars, an
                  insignificant sum to men who had in a week at full spring sent ten or twelve
                  thousand dollars adrift. Valenzuela proposed to push on to the San Jose Mission,
                  where they had an ally who would not hesitate to loan them any amount in thousands
                  for a fair interest.</p>
               <p>Joaquin would not follow this advice for reasons which he had, and preferred to
                  return to Sacramento, where the horses had remained in the keeping of one
                  Padrillo.</p>
               <p>While passing a shanty on the road, they heard suddenly a clamor of oaths,
                  exclamations and bursts of laughter.</p>
               <p>They turned back and went by, and did this again and again, until finally hearing
                  nothing but silence, as an Irishman might say, that made them all the more curious
                  and they stopped to listen.</p>
               <p>"I'll swear that was Garcia speaking," said Joaquin, who had especially noted one
                  of his worthy satellite's favorite execrations.</p>
               <p>The two began to peer through a couple of the many chinks in the miserably put
                  together planks of the establishment.</p>
               <p>Thus they could see pretty well a scene full of interest to them, while nobody
                  within had a thought of them.</p>
               <p>Through the cloudy air of the room full of the vapors from forty-rod rum, cheapest
                  whiskey and pipes, the witnesses beheld several clusters of men each around a
                  table of the half dozen, their aspect setting them down with photographic accuracy
                  as the most depraved and vicious of off-scourings of the city, men, if they
                  deserved the title, ready for anything, and the worst the better.</p>
               <p>Every one of the tables had its deck of cards, and every individual had a huge tin
                  mug or cup, into which he was often pouring his ordered beverage, the chief being
                  whatever poison it was that was in a couple of kegs in the corner.</p>
               <p>A smouldering fire every now and anon collected sufficient energy to dart up a
                  flame which danced around impishly on the faces of the outcasts, while overhead, a
                  half dozen ends of candles, cheap fifty-cent dips, sputtered and fought with the
                  thieves in their gutters, as if giving a lesson thus vigorously to quiescent
                  society.</p>
               <p>Between these upper and lower regions of feeble illumination, reigned a fog that
                  would have delighted a Londoner and made his northern neighbor recall the Scotch
                  mist.</p>
               <p>At one of the tables, farthest from the fire, were seated four of the most
                  villanous. One was no other than the illustrious Jack of the Three-fingers, whose
                  eyes were glaring most frightfully. His companions were Pedro Sanchez, Juan
                  Borilda and Joaquin Blanco, all three affiliated to the band in the honorable
                  office of spies, the first exercising that position around Stockton and Columbia,
                  the second at Stockton and the third at the San Luis Obisque Mission.</p>
               <p>The other groups were composed of English, Irish and American, who all seemed to
                  have drank more than they ought, but who, from that very reason were imbibing more
                  than ever.</p>
               <pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC8324-00000067"/>
               <p>Notwithstanding the tumult which arose in the rough concourse, the two
                  eaves-droppers could distinctly hear some sentences carelessly thundered by Mister
                  Jack, which surprised his commander not a little.</p>
               <p>"You have had all you deserve," cried Garcia, and I'll see you in h—before I'll
                  come down with a dollar more. Confound you, there was only a figure six of
                  thousands, and every man Jack of you fingered his thousand, Caramba! by the flames
                  and pitch forks of purgatory! did you think I was going to divide even with you,
                  when all you had to do and did do was leave the follow alone and I did for him.
                  Share and share alike, hey? You go to glass! I'll dig my claim alone after
                  this."</p>
               <p>As the stamp is put on the sealing wax, so the speaker gave the table such a
                  vigorous thump with a mallet-like first that the cards jumped up and danced as if
                  they were playing old <emph>sledge</emph> of themselves.</p>

                  <p>BLACK DIAMOND CUTS BLACK DIAMOND.—MORE TO HEAR,—THE POLICEMEN ARE TOO LATE AS
                     USUAL.—THE BOGUS JOAQUIN.—MORE BLOOD.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WHILE noisy Garcia was thus emphatic, a scene no less momentous was transpiring at
                  the other end of the palatial shanty. One of the drinkers at that part, after
                  having studied with inebriate's gravity the speech he had heard, rose and went as
                  if only to the fire, blunderingly lit a cigar while carefully scrutinizing the
                  Three-fingered desperado with as much astonishment as this muddled senses could
                  let him feel, and staggered back to his companions, into whose ears he whispered a
                  few startling words.</p>
               <p>They were no common ones, for six of the eight there seated, rose and reeled
                  out.</p>
               <p>Murieta and his lieutenant, followed them easily in the obscurity; the drunken
                  men, though made sober by the cool outer air, were so intent on their sudden
                  purpose that they minded their watchers no more than they did the rats that leaped
                  out of the hollows in the rotten planking called the sidewalk.</p>
               <p>Thinking intentively and quite correctly that three-fingered Jack had something to
                  do with the abrupt departure of the seven, the two Mexicans let them enter
                  undisturbed their tent, when they stepped up to it and listened easily through the
                  canvas.</p>
               <p>They had drawn and set the hammers of their revolvers in case they should be set
                  upon.</p>
               <p>"Did you take a good squint at him?" asked one of the men inside.</p>
               <p>"A first rate one, so good that I will remember him as long as my stick is
                  uncut."</p>
               <p>"But are you sure it is that man?"</p>
               <p>"Look a' here, I can't be chiseled on that, no how you fix it! I have seen him
                  many and many a time up in the mountains and, as sure as a gun, it is
                  Three-fingered Jack, one of the top-sawyers of Joaquin's cut-throats. And I'll go
                  as X besides that the old buck himself, Joaquin, is in town, for one is always
                  hanging around the other. They are jess like the pilot fish and shark we saw in
                  the Gulf coming out here in the Golden Gate. Anyway, those three ugly mugs with
                  him are of the band, I'll bet."</p>
               <p>"Thin Oi'll till yees fwat, me lads," said a third, "it explins all, be the
                  powers! there's not a bit o'wonder that we made Paddy Fitzsimmon's mothers of
                  oursel's las' noit, and missed our game, bedad!"</p>
               <p>"What do you mean, Redny?"</p>
               <p>"Shure yees ought to know. I mane the moiner that we ought to have mailed he
                  digger wid the pockets haping wid goold galore! This three-fingered Jack, as yees
                  stoyle him, is the omadhaun who slipped in nately an' robbed us, be Jabers! An'
                  thot's the mysthery, I'd go bail!"</p>
               <p>"By jingo, maybe that's so! I shouldn't wonder if the miners you speak of were
                  taken care of, that way. But it couldn't have been any great shakes of a robbery,
                  for I saw our birds drop feathers and feathers of 'slugs,' at the arcade monte
                  tables. To blazes and blackness with the Mexicans! Here they are leaving the woods
                  and mountains to needle with us in the city, r-r-rot em!"</p>
               <p>We must do the speaker the justice to declare him quite truthful in his
                  indignation.</p>
               <p>"That's me all over," grumbled another. "Deuce take the yellow bellies. What
                  brings the cursed greasers here? Here's five days and nights that we have been on
                  the lay; and we may lay down and kick the bucket before we'll make a raise!"</p>
               <p>"Shure the man's truth-telling," interposed "Redny," shaking the head which had
                  gained him the nickname as solemnly as if he were assenting to the profoundest of
                  philosophical axioms.</p>
               <p>"I'll give you my pinion," went on the man interrupted by the exile of Erin. "We
                  must make hash of these interlopers. When we've cleared them out, we will have all
                  to ourselves."</p>
               <p>"So, you mean a sudden muss with 'em—"</p>
               <p>"No, no, 'Legs,' none of that. You're loony to think of fighting 'em. Of course,
                  we could lick 'em, though they are uncommon h—with the knife, but it wouldn't pay,
                  d' you see. What I propose is: let's set the peerlers on their track, and if they
                  can't root'em out, we'll come into play and hunt up and Joaquin. You know there's
                  a reward out for him and when we get him—"</p>
               <p>"<emph>When!</emph> don't count your gold till it's minted—"</p>
               <p>"Dry up, Dodger, will you? Or else Joaquin won't be the first to get a wipe with
                  my knife. You are blind drunk, you fool. As I was a saying just now when Clumsy
                  shoved in his roar, where we get Joa—"</p>
               <p>"Who do you call fool and clumsy! I'll teach you—"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Will</emph> you shut? I'll——"</p>
               <p>"No, you won't. I can lick—"</p>
               <p>"Take that!"</p>
               <p>A slap was heard.</p>
               <p>"And you that, you bloody—"</p>
               <p>And the peculiar, awful sound of a well-struck knife passing through clothes to
                  bury itself in a human body, accompanied the words.</p>
               <p>Dodger had stabbed his mate.</p>
               <p>On the instant all the others sprang upon the assassin and as noisy and exciting a
                  struggles as ever took place in a circle of ten or twelve feet in diameter and
                  covered with canvas, thereupon ensued. As Joaquin and his friends did not care to
                  see the upshot of the scuffle, they left their stand of observation and proceeded
                  towards their own tent.</p>
               <p>They were born for adventures that night.</p>
               <p>A few steps only from the Fremont House, they encountered a couple of men,
                  convicts who had quitted Botany Bay without applying for tickets of leaves, who
                  were fresh from the taverns. They were both primed and charged deeply, and just at
                  the quarrelsome period.</p>
               <p>"Hullo! what in cell's this 'ere chap? shouted one of them, stopping before
                  Joaquin.</p>
               <p>"Ow's a fellow to know, matey?"</p>
               <p>"Mind your own business and pass on," said Joaquin.</p>
               <p>"No sarse or I'll——"</p>
               <pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC8324-00000068"/>
               <p>Before he could do anything with the weapon to which he carried his hand, he fell
                  to the ground, with his poisoned breath forming his last gasp. Murieta's dagger
                  had entered its full length in his side.</p>
               <p>His companion, sobered by the sight, recoiled and took to his legs, followed, by a
                  bullet from Valenzuela, but he disappeared untouched.</p>
               <p>The two Mexicans resumed their march peacefully as if nothing had taken place,
                  when they unexpectedly confronted a policeman, who had heard the shot and demanded
                  the reason of it. Joaquin slouched his hat over his face for precaution's sake,
                  shook his arm free from his ample cloak and carelessly laid his hand on his
                  revolver. But, seeing a second person coming up, and suspecting him to be another
                  policeman, he responded in a polite tone.</p>
               <p>"The shot was by accident, sir. My friend here was putting his revolver in its
                  case when the trigger or hammer caught in the strap and it went off somehow or
                  other."</p>
               <p>"What made you run so quick?" asked the second policeman of his comrade.</p>
               <p>"Oh, nothing. I heard a shot and thought it another murder," replied he, and he
                  added, turning to Joaquin; "You say your friend was putting up his revolver—what
                  made him have it out?"</p>
               <p>"He was carrying it in his hand, sir. There are too many rascals around at this
                  late hour for there to be no danger in the streets. My friend wanted to be
                  ready."</p>
               <p>"Why didn't he keep the Colt in his hand?"</p>
               <p>"Because I laughed him out of his fears and told him that the police were so
                  active <emph>in this quarter</emph> that the rogues had been pretty well thinned
                  out!"</p>
               <p>The policemen felt merciful all of a sudden, but he continued his
                  cross-questioning, a delightful occupation to many men in office.</p>
               <p>"But you were just now telling us there <emph>was</emph> danger in the streets,"
                  said he, putting the poser with the tone of a Choate. "You are so
                     <emph>prevaricativeory</emph> (how he did rattle out the new word, a pet one,
                  no doubt!) that I don't know whether to believe you or not."</p>
               <p>"I beg your pardon, sir, I meant that weapons were not needed till the danger
                  appeared."</p>
               <p>"What do you think, Charley? Won't it be best to arrest 'em—there are so many
                  rascallions about, indeed, though <emph>our</emph> ward <emph>is</emph> so-so. And
                  the wind to-night is just the thing for incendiaries and the time seems up for
                  another Great Fire. I think it will be prudent to hold them."</p>
               <p>"No, I don't think so myself. Let 'em alone, they're all right. Ned, you are too
                  cheeky altogether. You are as lippy as a Tombs' Shyster who's fingered a knuck's
                  fee."</p>
               <p>"I know what I say, never fear."</p>
               <p>"I hope so, you're sure thing for judge next election!"</p>
               <p>"Shut up! You're worse than Billy Milligan. You who fire off six-shooters so
                  clumsily, be off to bed. <emph>A rest</emph> is better than arrest, remember. Come
                  along, Charley, we'll look into Neil's and have a whiskey skin."</p>
               <p>"That's me."</p>
               <p>Joaquin politely bade the worthy guardians good night and went off with his
                  companion in the direction of the rum-shop where they had seen Three-fingered
                  Jack.</p>
               <p>"If that stupid had persisted in talking of marching us along to the lock up,"
                  remarked the bandit chief, "I'd have left a place vacant in the force."</p>
               <p>"So would I, for the other," added Valenzuela.</p>
               <p>The uproar which resounded inside the shanty was sufficient to prove that his
                  drinking continued. Joaquin looked through a crevice again and perceived the man
                  still in the same place but so drunk that he had much ado to keep his head up, and
                  it did fall forward every little while. Murieta charged Valenzuela to watch
                  outside, entered the drinking-place, strode straight up to the table and roughly
                  shook his lieutenant by the shoulder. Garcia rose furiously and felt for his
                  revolver.</p>
               <p>"Oh! Murieta!"</p>
               <p>"Hush! Come! I want you to leave this town before dawn."</p>
               <p>"What for? what's the row?"</p>
               <p>"Because the hounds are on our trail and in a few minutes perhaps you will be
                  nabbed."</p>
               <p>"Caramba! that just suits this child. How many are going to try to take me?" said
                  he stoutly.</p>
               <p>"Too many for us to resist them when they will have a thousand citizens to back
                  them. Come along!"</p>
               <p>"Have it your own way."</p>
               <p>He rolled out of the place, followed by his three companions.</p>
               <p>Joaquin conducted all his men to Blanco's house, where they slept till dawn; then
                  he sent away the Blanco, namesake of the host, to San Luis, and directed Borilda
                  and Sanchez to regain their respective haunts. Three-fingered Jack was told to
                  take the San Jose Road and make a bee-line for the general rendezvous.</p>
               <p>In the afternoon of the same day, the chief and Valenzuela took passage for
                  Sacramento where they found their horses all right. Thence they started forthwith
                  for Stockton in order to give Borilda some necessary orders relating to other
                  members of the band, who were to reach Arroyo Cantuva <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >via</foreign> Stockton.</p>
               <p>Three or four days after Joaquin's departure, rumor had it in San Franciscan
                  street that the celebrated Marauder of the Mines had been arrested and was caged
                  in the jail.</p>
               <p>A poor devil of a Mexican had indeed been caught who had been profiting under
                  Murieta's name.</p>
               <p>A number of sight-seers rushed to the prison to feast on the dish of bandit served
                  in his jacket, potato fashion, and probably were as well satisfied as if they had
                  seen the Simon Pure.</p>
               <p>All this time, the latter was on his undisturbed travels.</p>
               <p>Three-fingered Jack had stolen a magnificent horse with fine saddle and bridle and
                  silver spurs from a rich Mexican who lived near the Dolores Mission; next he cut
                  the throat of a Chinaman near Alviso in addition to despoiling him of his blankets
                  and clothes; so with one James Walsh, around the San Jose Mission.</p>
               <p>This latter murder gave him three hundred and fifty dollars, a gold watch and a
                  revolver.</p>
               <p>Two Mexican rancheros suspected of this deed, were taken to San Francisco, but
                  they were lucky enough to be let off as they deserved.</p>
               <p>A week later, another pride of the Pirates of the Placers, Rafael Quintara,
                  stabbed at Santiago, near Columbia, a man who had never harmed him in the least, a
                  most respectable citizen. This inexplicable assassination excited the deepest
                  indignation all over the country.</p>
               <p>The energetic detective John Leary went in pursuit of the criminal; but he lost
                  him in the intricacies of the mountain.</p>
               <p>On the next day or the next after that, Quintara came out of his hiding place and
                  knifed one Samuel Slater, from whom he took some specimens of ore, two revolvers
                  and provisions. It was only days after that the body was discovered half eaten by
                  coyotes.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>THE BAND BEGINS TO LESSEN.—THE SPUR TO REVENGE.—THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE
                     END.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AFTER having ravaged the country for many weeks and scattered desolation and
                  mourning among the populations who could not find an enemy only known when he
                  struck, Joaquin called off his hounds.</p>
               <p>He had lost many of his bravest and most useful men, and dared not stay long in
                  any one camp, but he perhaps believed himself rewarded for all that by having as
                  fruit of his many enterprises considerable sums.</p>
               <p>The horde left Calaveras Country and transported the seat of operations into
                  Mariposa County. This latter district suffered in its turn all that its neighbor
                  had undergone.</p>
               <p>We have not space to relate here the crimes of which it was the victim and
                  witness, an everlasting record of bloody scenes like those already set before the
                  reader.</p>
               <p>The devil that seemed to direct and protect Murieta, did not seem desirous of
                  abandoning him yet; leaden bullets seemed never to have been moulded to slay him,
                  and we are not afraid to assert that some of his baffled pursuers may have cast
                  balls of dollars to try the virtue of silver against him.</p>
               <p>Though continually on the wing, these vultures were tireless in their swoops for
                  murder and booty.</p>
               <p>Everywhere behind them, they left a sanguinary streak to mark their passage and,
                  at times, their most horrid crimes were executed under the very eyes of their
                  chasers.</p>
               <p>Cases were known when the latter had heard before them a yell for help or of
                  agony, had pressed on their winded steeds, but only to behold victims weltering in
                  blood, and to see the bandits, dashing off, perchance lighting cigarettes.</p>
               <p>At the most of the time, Joaquin's freebooters were divided into small bands of
                  five or six.</p>
               <p>Murieta himself had rarely more than four with him, but they were the
                  lieutenants.</p>
               <p>Valenzuela and Three-fingered Jack were always beside him.</p>
               <p>Guerra had the keeping of the camp. Sevalio was in the field and had no rival for
                  daring and skill in the plundering, except Antonio.</p>
               <p>This latter had a particular liking for the country round about Putah and Cache
                  Creek; he was the terror of horse-owners. Every day almost he was chased, but
                  thanks to a splendid steed which carried him, he always made out to escape.</p>
               <p>This animal was the same which Texas Jack had been presented with by Joaquin.</p>
               <p>Some days before leaving Stockton, the captain of the coyotes, while lying perdu
                  in a Hunter Street house, was told by Valenzuela that Texas Jack was taken and was
                  going to be tried for an important theft.</p>
               <p>The chief went into the court-house and sat down quietly like any other spectator.
                  While the judge was passing sentence on the culprit of five years' imprisonment,
                  the latter was looking over the hall and perceived his commander. A scarcely
                  perceptible signal was exchanged between them and the condemned man thought
                  himself sure of safety once more.</p>
               <p>Unluckily for him, Joaquin had only three of his men in the whole town, which was
                  hardly a sufficient force.</p>
               <p>He said afterwards that if he could have found a dozen men, he would have tried to
                  take the prisoner from the police officers as they proceeded to take the steamboat
                  for Benicia.</p>
               <p>Five months afterwards, a queer but true story went the rounds.</p>
               <p>There had been discovered in a huge grave dug in the ground of a rancho belonging
                  to Texas Jack, a man and a horse. The rider had not left the saddle and his spurs
                  were still on his boots.</p>
               <p>All seemed to say that the man had been struck on the top of the head while in
                  that place and position, and the murder was of recent date. Besides him were found
                  skulls and bones, the last remains of other victims of the desperadoes.</p>
               <p>One evening, while in a tent of a connection of his association, three miles from
                  Mariposa, Joaquin was informed that two more of his men were off the rolls, having
                  been hanged for horse-stealing at San Juan.</p>
               <p>They had been pursued and caught between Gilroy's and el Pajaro, bound and taken
                  back to the town; and committed for trial by Judge Mohan. The people, who had
                  suffered losses in live stock, had assembled, taken the captives from the officers
                  and strung them up according to Lynch law.</p>
               <p>On this intelligence, the captain mounted and with his body guard of four went
                  towards Monterey County.</p>
               <p>On the banks of the San Benito, not far from San Juan, he established his
                  camping-ground, where they remained about half a week, carefully concealed during
                  the day, but employing the night in stealing all the valuable equino cattle that
                  they had marked at the different farms.</p>
               <p>When they had believed that they had sufficiently avenged their gibbeted comrades,
                  they broke camp and drove the animals to Arroyo Cantuva.</p>
               <p>The majority of the plunderers were already there.</p>
               <p>Almost all the parties had luckily terminated their enterprises and were awaiting
                  fresh directions.</p>
               <p>Thereupon began the preparations for the important acts which were to end with the
                  brigand in California.</p>
               <p>He had formed a connection with the richest and most influential Mexicans in the
                  state and was sure of their co-operation in his projects.</p>
               <p>The other people did not dream of any great plan being conceived by a man they
                  considered a mere marauder.</p>
               <p>Joaquin commenced by despatching to Mexico his intelligent Antonio, who was
                  furnished with funds and the necessary instructions for the arming and equipping
                  of volunteers and partisans, of whom he was sure beforehand, as they were waiting
                  only for the call.</p>
               <p>Guerra was sent to the different ranchos in the state where depots of horses had
                  been selected; he was to get together these animals and conduct them to the
                  head-quarters, along with all the men he might meet.</p>
               <p>The captain for his part, had an important piece of business to transact at San
                  Luis Obispo, for which he started the same day, with only one attendant. It was an
                  interview with the Mexican woman whom he had encountered accidentally some months
                  before in the Hangtown stage.</p>
               <p>This woman, sister of Joaquin's first love, Carmela, had wedded a wealthy ranchero
                  of Guadalajara, Mexico. On her husband's death, she had left her property and come
                  to California, to fan the flames of vengeance in Murieta's heart and press him to
                  carry out his shameful plans against peaceful honest citizens.</p>
               <p>She had heard him with regret express his determination to give up roving after
                  one more burst, but, as she found she could not dissuade him, she held council
                  with him and returned to Mexico on the day after their meeting.</p>
               <p>The next week, Joaquin thought of placing the girls in some sure place where
                  nothing could happen to them. He gave Sevalio a score of his most trusty rascals
                  as an escort to them into the province of Sonora.</p>
               <p>The bandit leader marked out the following road for them: along the Gulf<pb
                     n="136-137" xml:id="VAC8324-00000070"/> of California, towards the San Pedro
                  and Santa Catarina Missions, thence to gain San Francisco Borgia and the Santa
                  Gertrudis Mission, cutting through a mountainous and thickly wooded district well
                  known to Sevalio.</p>
               <p>Joaquin accompanied the party some little ways to see them off, took affectionate
                  leave of Clarina, gave a kiss all round to the other girls, to their great
                  delight, and returned.</p>
               <p>Reflecting that the best plan was to await the arrival of the new partisans from
                  Lower California and Sonora, before assembling the men he had already, he
                  countermanded the orders to Guerra and sent off his available forces into the
                  region around him. With a party of six, he traveled Calaveras County through.</p>
               <p>While so doing, he came to Jackson, robbing a miner named Jewel of three hundred
                  dollars-worth of gold, a revolver and other valuables. His companions, the
                  inseparable Valenzuela and three-fingered Jack, had their share in the
                  understanding and never had the detestable Garcia been more in his element than
                  during the stay in Calaveras and the surrounding counties.</p>
               <p>Success went hand and glove with the chief in all his past three week's doings, in
                  the northern part of Calaveras County.</p>
               <p>Large sums of gold came into his grasping hands, so large that it was no more than
                  prudent to shift the locality. Before the place could cry "good riddance,"
                  however, he was joined by fourteen or fifteen of his men who had been making a
                  descent on the neighborhood of Thom's Creek, in Colusi County, where they had
                  obtained a quantity of horses, to drive which to the main rendezvous four of them
                  were told off.</p>
               <p>Joaquin kept this unexpected reinforcement, went up to the headquarters of the
                  Stanislaus and continued, in the rich valleys watered by that stream, the scenes
                  of desolation which we have seen him renew so many times.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>After two weeks spent in the Stanislaus Valley, Joaquin made for the Rivers
                  Mariposa and Merced. He "blazed" his path as usual by extensive depredations;
                  after which he sent off all his followers except the original half dozen to the
                  Arrayo.</p>
               <p>With them he retired to the rancho of a Mexican of San Jose, killing on the way a
                  Frenchman who kept a public drinking garden, and concealed himself there for a
                  while. The host was a secret member of the gang.</p>
               <p>As they sat by the fire that night, Joaquin fulfilled a half promise which he had
                  made in times past, and related most forcibly the adventures of the celebrated
                  Massaroni.</p>
               <p>He had learnt his particulars from men like Antonio who knew well the behind-the
                  scenes of banditti life, and hence what follows is not a more writer's fancy but
                  such facts as can obtained, if you are acute enough, from descendants in Italy of
                  the banditti who acted their parts.</p>
               <p>The police accounts tell only one half the story.</p>
               <p>Massaroni was a young man when, up by the head waters of the Tagliamento, under
                  the brow of the Alps, he lived to love a young girl of the country.</p>
               <p>She robbed her parents of other valuables than herself and accompanied young
                  Allessgndro to Venice.</p>
               <p>For half a year they dwelt together, and marriage was agreed upon by them.</p>
               <p>But at that time, the youth's habits and manners changed.</p>
               <p>He was away whole nights and days and, after being profuse in harsh words, one
                  time struck her who had given him all, her future life and happiness, her
                  honor.</p>
               <p>All the blood of the Italian flamed up at the insult, and she spoke to him as he
                  had little expected to be addressed.</p>
               <p>Suffice it, that he left her, swearing he never would see her more.</p>
               <p>She let him go, proudly silent, but then, bowed her head on her bosom and kissed
                  her own breasts, sadly saying:</p>
               <p>"No more <emph>mine,</emph> no more <emph>his—its</emph> only and evermore! I live
                  for that alone Allessandro, thou faithless one!"</p>
               <p>In a few weeks, Massaroni had brushed off his regrets and twinges of conscience
                  and become hand and glove with the <foreign xml:lang="ITA">bravi</foreign> of
                  Venice the Free, the Beautiful, the Powerful.</p>
               <p>His extraordinary good fortune raised him speedily several grades, and he soon
                  attained such a position that he could luxuriate during half the week, on the
                  proceeds of robberies during the other half.</p>
               <p>For the furtherance of his designs, he frequented pretty aristocratic, or, at
                  least, wealthy company.</p>
               <p>For many months he held his assumed place of a stranger, preserving incognite for
                  reasons, silencing the easily corrupted police, and—and after learning valuable
                  secrets of rakish noblemen—having them robbed as no other could have done.</p>
               <p>One night only, as he was about entering a casino, or gambling den, a woman
                  stopped him and begged him to follow her to the house of, she said, "one who was
                  dying, and loved him."</p>
               <p>He thought it merely one of the too numerous intrigues and shoved her aside.</p>
               <p>He forgot all about it.</p>
               <p>Besides, the next day was the great regatta and he had entered a boat for a race,
                  the agreement and stakes to be settled that night.</p>
               <p>These races are great events in so watery a city as that Bride of the Sea.</p>
               <p>Next day, the grand canal was covered with the flags of countless craft, filled
                  with gaily attired people, while banners floated from the windows of the double
                  rows of palatial buildings all along the aqueous highway.</p>
               <p>The racers left Castello, skirted the Schalvonic Wharf and through the grand canal
                  to the church of Santo Lucia, where they turned a flag-buoy and returned to the
                  Foscairo Palace, where a grand stand had been erected for the doge and chief
                  persons.</p>
               <p>It took some time for the chief matches to be concluded, but then began to private
                  ones, Massaronio's turn was next to the comic one of the women, a most laughable
                  burlesque.</p>
               <p>The robber's antagonist was an Austrian named Pottergeist.</p>
               <p>The gondoliers of both craft were Venitians, but the people were all on
                  Massaroni's side from his being as decidedly a countryman as the other was a
                  foreigner.</p>
               <p>Off went the two hearse-like boats, keeping together well until out of sight.</p>
               <p>On the return, the two prows were on the same line still, while they seemed to fly
                  over rather than cut through the surface.</p>
               <p>"Good, Pietro! again, again, Giorgio! Bravo! See, see, he's ahead! Italy forever!
                  down with the Austrian!"</p>
               <p>Massaroni was seated in the little cabin of his boat as his rival was in his, for
                  the gondolas "carried weight," which made all more interesting.</p>
               <p>"But the spectators could not see into the covered receptacle for passengers
                  though the latter could incite their servants.</p>
               <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC8324-00000071"/>
               <p>'On, Pictro, you are like a winged bird! five hundred to you if you pass by a
                  length!" cried Massaroni.'</p>
               <p>His gondolier looked aslant at his opponent and by a vigorous bending of his oars,
                  gained notably.</p>
               <p>"Keep it up, and they are losers!" encouraged Allessandro.</p>
               <p>"Hey there, Giorgio!" yelled a mocking voice from the shore, "you <emph>are</emph>
                  slow! is it a fat friar you've aboard who wants to go gingerly after his
                  dinner?"</p>
               <p>The Austrian's man doubled his exertions and recovered his former position of neck
                  and neck.</p>
               <p>Cheers ran along each edge of the water, with intermingling taunts and laughs.</p>
               <p>"On, on, Pietro, never fear!"</p>
               <p>"Fear, signor? By Saint Mark, if I had my gunwale loaded down to the very water,
                  I'd wager to beat Giorgio and his skiff empty."</p>
               <p>The two kept very equal; whenever one slackened his exertions for a space, the
                  other shot ahead, only to be overtaken similarly when his burst died away.</p>
               <p>"Good heart, Pietro!" cried Massaroni, appearing in the cabin entrance, "the goal
                  is near! Think of the crowd a-looking!"</p>
               <p>"A fico for them, signor," answered the man, working as untiringly as if his
                  muscles were of steel; "By Santa Maria del Rosario, you may rely on the rown!
                  Tough work, though," murmured he.</p>
               <p>(These Italian gondoliers are weariless fellows," said Joaquin; "like those
                  boatmen on the Chagres River who pole the barges against the current—they don't
                  know fatigue when they are at work, and only feel tired when resting—you
                  understand, amigos?")</p>
               <p>The gondolier's speech had been heard by the Austrian on the other bark, and he
                  said to his man, severely:</p>
               <p>"Giorgio, you hear?"</p>
               <p>"Bah! his tongue works better than his arms," muttered Giorgio. "I'll be —— if I
                  don't sail in first—your five thousand crowns are safe to you as if they were in
                  bank, per Bacco!"</p>
               <p>"A thousand are yours in that case, besides a full indulgence that I will get of
                  the papal legate for your soul."</p>
               <p>"Ha! no more words, See!"</p>
               <p>Giorgio closed his lips, knit his brows in resolution, and so well expended his
                  power that he drew a whole length ahead of the other.</p>
               <p>"The Austrian forever!" cried many.</p>
               <p>"Bravo, my man," shouted Pottergeist.</p>
               <p>"Pietro, you villain, you're asleep," yelled Alessandro.</p>
               <p>"Am I?" returned the boatman, making an effort and slightly more than recovering
                  his distance. "Pooh! I've been three years on the waters more than that
                  Giorgio."</p>
               <p>But Massaroni's growing fears were far from being quieted.</p>
               <p>"That Giorgio" seemed to have but the one idea, that of overcoming his adversary
                  by tiring him out, which in fact he promised yet to do. He shot a bit ahead, and
                  every time that his contestant endeavored to come up to him, he put out his force
                  so that Massaroni's champion, exhausted considerably by his efforts, was compelled
                  to work almost double to even keep in the other's wake. These tactics so well
                  aided Giorgio that he and his master became confident that if things kept on as
                  they were, to them would be the victory. Pottergeist understood the plan no doubt,
                  for he fell back into the little cabin, after saying:</p>
               <p>"A thousand."</p>
               <p>"Get 'em ready, master," replied the boatman, straining at the oars.</p>
               <p>"You're failing, Pietro," cried his employer, clutching the curtains with his
                  nervous fingers. "That wretch goes like the devil!"</p>
               <p>The end was so near that both the principals came out of the cabins and stood in
                  full view like the boatmen.</p>
               <p>"I'll beat the devil, be sure, master mine," growled Pietro, bending to it.</p>
               <p>He was fully behind the Austrian, but he flattered himself that with an
                  extraordinary essay, he could at least recover the former place of side by side,
                  as he had managed to do before. But Giorgio, attentive to his movements, put out
                  all his strength simultaneously with Pietro, and if anything gained something by
                  the exertion. But what finished the lingering of Massaroni's hopes was that the
                  opposing gondolier, three times in succession, repeated as many, long sweeps of
                  the oar.</p>
               <p>A thunder of acclamation broke on either side and echoed in the cornices and
                  niches of the carved windows.</p>
               <p>"Malediction on you," roared Massaroni, "what flattery ever made you take to
                  gondolas for a living, old helpless, Pietro? Two thousand for you, if you come in
                  head!"</p>
               <p>"I'll do it, if nothing breaks!"</p>
               <p>Already incited by vanity and rivalry and now super-excited by the reward, the
                  loser made immense efforts. He seemed to forget to breathe, and his oars were
                  hardly to be seen feathering; they moved like the sails of a windmill. Hope
                  returned to Massaroni, but he was only to have a short taste of joy.</p>
               <p>The goal was at hand. All were on the alert, and too much interested to make a
                  sound of either applause or censure.</p>
               <p>But Gorgio had spared his skill and power for this dash, and when he saw his
                  adversary flurried and rowing desperately, he felt sure, that he was the victor.
                  Pietro was like the jockey who plies the persuaders and the thong on his beaten
                  horse, Giorgio the one who comes in without having touched his steed with spur or
                  whip. He plied his oars as regularly as if he were at an everyday work.</p>
               <p>"Won, won!" cried Massaroni, as his gondola forged ahead.</p>
               <p>The flagboat to be passed was not twenty yards off.</p>
               <p>At that very moment, poor Pietro fell forward on his oars, which were jerked up
                  out of the water, and measured his length forward. The Austrian flew on amid
                  waving of hats and veils, a fluttering of flowers and fans, and cheers and
                  clapping of hands. The other boat, nevertheless, followed and ran gently against
                  the victor.</p>
               <p>"Allow me your hand, Signor Allessandro," said Pottergeist, as he stood on the
                  quay. "You have lost, my friend, but, per Dio, our horses ran well."</p>
               <p>Massaroni felt an awful thirst for the speaker's blood, but that was not to be
                  indulged in there, of course, amid that throng. He could not conceal his pailor
                  but he felt that he had to put on dignity. So he kept down his envy and hatred,
                  and forced a laugh as he gave the winner his hand.</p>
               <p>"Our men have well run," said he, "there is no doubt of that. I'm afraid, though,
                  that my old waterman is hurt."</p>
               <p>"He's dead—see!" said half a dozen voices. "Burst a blood-vessel!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no odds," remarked the captain, "a couple of <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >paters</foreign> and some masses will make it all well, for Pietro is without
                  kith or kin."</p>
               <p>That was remedied, and Massaroni left the crowd.</p>
               <p>That night, into a certain casino, sauntered he. He had some money, how obtained,
                  no matter. He wore his most smiling mask, for his pride would have suffered if he
                  had fancied any of the bystanders pitied him. Luckily for him, his friends were
                  feasting, and he was well warmed up by the supper. He was the first to speak of
                  his defeat and offer to pay the bet.</p>
               <p>"But," said he, "do you mind trying if cards are as much against me as gondolas,
                  Pottergeist. Shall we say, double or quits?"</p>
               <p>"Just as you like. The double-eagle can outsoar St. Mark's lion at every thing,"
                  rejoined the Austrian gaily.</p>
               <pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC8324-00000072"/>
               <p>Chance was for Massaroni at the first, and he cleared off his debt. Then he staked
                  money, and won game after game, when as the Austrian was drained pretty deeply, he
                  gained a considerable stake.</p>
               <p>"Time for you!" said Massaroni, forgetting himself.</p>
               <p>"At cards, there is always time," returned the other coolly.</p>
               <p>"Let's keep on, as I want to play on to the end. The blade, then the handle, and
                  even the knob on the hilt after that!"</p>
               <p>"Just what I was going to say."</p>
               <p>It was Massaroni's turn to lose what was before him. The other appeared to
                  regulate his play and made him pass through all the variations of the sliding
                  scale which he had lately undergone, until a thousand crowns was his antagonist's
                  all.</p>
               <p>"Time for <emph>you!</emph>" murmured he.</p>
               <p>"What do you mean?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, nothing. I was merely thinking what a fine thing it is for people to keep
                  cool."</p>
               <p>"What——"</p>
               <p>But the tone of this exclamation gave Pottergiest caution, and he was too
                  experienced a gambler to quarrel with a man who yet had money. So he smoothed his
                  brow and met the Italian's stake.</p>
               <p>"By the bye, will you take my word for thrice this, so as to make it four
                  thousand?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly. You have lost, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">mio cara,</foreign>" added the
                  Austrian in triumph.</p>
               <p>"The devil has bewitched the cards," said Allessandro, tossing off a bumper. "The
                  devil again! the drink's bitter!" and he put down the glass so roughly that it
                  fell off and smashed on the floor.</p>
               <p>"Bad omen!" croaked some neighboring voice.</p>
               <p>"Thank you, unknown signor," sneered the ruined gamester. "A pretty prophecy,
                  after the act. Good or bad, I'll play no longer with you Pottergeist. Where's my
                  young friend Monteafiere?"</p>
               <p>"Busy," answered the Austrian; "he always loses at cards with you, but he gain's
                  over you in the good graces of lovely Sylvia. By the bye, how is she?"</p>
               <p>"You saw her at the regatta as well as I—do you laugh at me?"</p>
               <p>"Bachus forbid."</p>
               <p>Allessandro turned and left the saloon.</p>
               <p>"By the good Saint Pantaleone, he's very pale. Young Pisano looked so the night
                  when he leaped off the Molo with a huge stone in his cloak to sink him," remarked
                  some one.</p>
               <p>"Tush. Massaroni is more like to kill than self-kill," said another.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the subject of these remarks had rushed frantically away toward his
                  fashionable lodgings.</p>
               <p>As he was wildly picking his way through the labyrinth of poverty-stricken lanes
                  that are behind the canal-banks' grand and splendid buildings, he heard a cry of
                  "help!"</p>
               <p>Help! he wanted it himself and fancied that Satan was mocking him.</p>
               <p>All was lost. Gold was gone and he had dipped already in his mistress Sylvia's
                  purse, shameful as he considered her gift.</p>
               <p>Midnight assassinations and robberies had ceased to pay, for the nobles had larger
                  escorts than ever when they went visiting, since crimes had of late grown so
                  numerous.</p>
               <p>"Help" was the cry once more.</p>
               <p>More deeply affected than he ought to have been to all appearance, Allessandro
                  stopped and listened.</p>
               <p>An infant's wail joined in the outcries. He strode through the mud up a miry
                  alley. A feeble light gleamed before him.</p>
               <p>He burst in a door of a hovel.</p>
               <p>By the glimmer of a dying lamp, Allessandro beheld, on a heap of mouldy straw, a
                  shape of a woman who, writhing in the pangs of the fever of the marshes, uttered
                  the screams he had heard.</p>
               <p>Near her was a quite young babe, whose similar cries grew weaker and weaker every
                  time. The fine but unkempt hair streamed over the mother's face, but, at the crash
                  of the stove-in door, she seemed to collect her forces sufficiently to sit half up
                  and say in an awful voice, hollow and hoarse:</p>
               <p>"Bread, bread! anything to eat!"</p>
               <p>At the voice, at the sight presented, Massaroni drew back as if the fuse of a
                  powder mine had been burning at his feet. Indescribable horror overcame his
                  senses, and for an instant he had much ado not to believe himself a plaything of
                  delirium.</p>
               <p>Was this real, or had his losses driven him mad?</p>
               <p>The walls streaming with damp, like the plashy floor, the wretched mockery of a
                  bed, the dying child, the wasted wreck of a mother, this complete picture of
                  thirst and hunger added to the worst of woes—was it possible on an earth over
                  which rounded God's heaven?</p>
               <p>But this shadow of a woman, this mere reflection of one of the darlings of man,
                  she to be here of all! Satan must have enrobed himself in that shell to wound him
                  with many a dreadful reflection!</p>
               <p>The features, thinned as they were, were but to well known to him—yet could those
                  faded, sunken cheeks be the same on which rained his tears of excessive joy and
                  kisses of immoderate rapture in the days of their enticing bloom? Those hands,
                  fine as threads, mere bone, extended to him in all the anguish of despairing
                  supplication—they had a thousand times thrilled joy into him when interlaced with
                  his own? And those eyes, bright with fever and approaching madness—could they ever
                  have been the twin wells from which had poured the bliss which he had bathed in,
                  ravished, and sworn to be inexhaustible?</p>
               <p>"Isalia! is it you?" gasped he, trembling to receive the answer.</p>
               <p>"Bread, bread," was all the poor creature could say, as she fell back on the
                  straw.</p>
               <p>"Speak, speak again!" cried the man, moving nearer to the rotting couch. "Is it
                  you, Isalia! Isalia, I say! <emph>is it you?</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"Ah—h! Allessandro! All's not lost if it's you—I die, no bread—for four day's
                  starving—and the baby cannot—"</p>
               <p>"Good God—can it be! Halloa! ho there! help help! bread, bread!"</p>
               <p>But louder though his voice was than hers, no better fortune was his. Not a sound
                  replied.</p>
               <p>"No one comes," whispered she, "go yourself for—a drop of water—a crumb of bread!
                  Don't let me die now, Pandro, with our child—"</p>
               <p>"Our child!—Wait, wait! Hope, hope, I will make you happy."</p>
               <p>So saying, he kissed avidly her wasted hands; he flung himself on his knees on the
                  cold floor, kissed her again and again, then the infant's forehead until, suddenly
                  called to their state, he sprang up and rushed away.</p>
               <p>The air of the street so contrasted with that of the valley and the hovel tha it
                  made him shudder and reel. He hesitated.</p>
               <p>At that hour, every house was closed and the streets and canals untenanted except
                  by miscreants and the police, which latter he feared more than the other from
                  being on only too intimate a footing with them. He made for his residence, running
                  at the top of his speed. Long and loudly did he knock at the door, swearing at the
                  sluggish servants and trying to break in. But the whole household was away.</p>
               <p>He remembered.</p>
               <p>"Confusion! I said I would be at the ball and gave them leave to be out all night
                  like myself. My valet is to await me at Sylvia's. To Sylvia's then!"</p>
               <p>Off again he set like a madman. Lights burned at the courtesan's, and he<pb
                     n="142-143" xml:id="VAC8324-00000073"/> almost instantly was let in. He very
                  nearly upset the porter. Before flying up the staircase, he turned and, seeing
                  behind him the shuddering servant, cried imperiously:</p>
               <p>"Giobbe! bread, wine, instantly."</p>
               <p>Poor Giobbe, as terrified as his patient biblical namesake was at the advent of
                  the whirl wind, ran away to obey his orders and tell the kitchen-girl of his
                  mistress's lover's state, relating circumstantially how he must have beheld the
                  ghost of headless Faliero, or the armless gondolier of the Canal della Giudecea,
                  or the twin ballet-girls of the Apollo Theatre who had been flying off the Campo
                  di Marte Bridge by drunken scions of noble houses.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, Massaroni had ascended the steps and pounded at Sylvia's
                  room.</p>
               <p>Delay.</p>
               <p>At last, the waiting-maid opened and gave a shriek of alarm at sight of his
                  appalling face. She thought her last hour had come when those flaming eyes poured
                  a scorching fire on her, but he was impelled by too great emotion to quarrel with
                  the servant for her slowness. Like a thunderbolt he burst through the door of
                  Sylvia's bedroom.</p>
               <p>Now he recoiled.</p>
               <p>Instead of finding the lovely courtesan abed and asleep, she was dressed and
                  standing pale and agitated, learning on the arm of a sofa. But Allessandro was not
                  in a mood to calmly analyse his surprise.</p>
               <p>"Do you love me, Sylvia?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"What do you mean?" stammered she, her limbs failing her; she almost shrieked!
                  "don't look at me so!"</p>
               <p>"Loving me or not, I must save her! I have spent heaven knows how much on you!
                  give me some money!"</p>
               <p>The astounded Aspacia was far from understanding, but with an earnestness given to
                  her by the fear of irritating Allesandro she mechanically unlocked her sacket and
                  poured out the coin into her chief lover's hands; she was going to add her jewelry
                  when, to her still greater surprise, Massaroni rushed out as abruptly as he had
                  come, pocketing the money.</p>
               <p>In a few instants, the watering-maid came in to say:</p>
               <p>"Whatever will become of us! the signor has gone away with a loaf of bread under
                  each arm, and Pietro with a basket of wine."</p>
               <p>"What can this mean?" murmured Sylvia, sinking on the sofa. "I am ready to perish
                  with fear."</p>
               <p>"Keep up a good heart, lovely one," said a man's voice, that of Monteafiere, "I'll
                  run to the casino and learn all. If he has found all out, believe me, you will not
                  suffer from his anger."</p>
               <p>"What do you mean? Why, youth, he can undoubtedly defeat you at sword, stiletto or
                  pistolet," said the courtesan, seemingly to awaken to the superiority of the lover
                  she deceived over her present dialoguist.</p>
               <p>Monteafiere dismissed the maid.</p>
               <p>"I fight him, not as duellist, but as an unconquerable!" returned he proudly,
                  then.</p>
               <p>"Who are you!" demanded Sylvia, letting a scrutinizing look dwell upon his face.
                  "You're not rich, or you would not levy on me, whose love, too, you have forced
                  from me. Who, who?"</p>
               <p>"Either tremble or be fearless, my cherished one, no matter," laughed the young
                  man; "it is true, anyway, that I bear a talisman that opens all doors, and puts
                  all at my command. I am Mental, the second inquisitor, next to Messer Grand
                  himself!"</p>
               <p>"'Sh!" gasped the woman with blanched cheeks.</p>
               <p>"But only a lover to you, dear charmer."</p>
               <p>She smiled and turned away playfully, but, if the executor of the orders of the
                  terrible Ten had more attentively watched her, he would have seen her dash a tear
                  from her eyes, and, could he have read her thoughts—but few men ever did that to
                  woman—he would have found one thus:</p>
               <p>"I love Allessandro more than ever now that I find I was right to feel disgust at
                  this wretch forcing himself on me!"</p>
               <p>"Is it true?" asked she with cunning.</p>
               <p>"True! Behold!" and he triumphantly flaunted a yellow card dotted in one corner
                  with a black seal, whose melted wax had fastened a little ribbon of sable and a
                  gold stripe to it.</p>
               <p>She shuddered. That piece of pasteboard was as powerful as many a noble's purse or
                  sword.</p>
               <p>"I must escape from the city," she thought. "It is worse than death to be in his
                  arms."</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, she had to resign herself to them and assume her most winning air.
                  But her unpleasant task was not long imposed upon her, and she thanked whatever
                  divinity her courtesan's heart might worship when a prolonged knocking at the
                  front door of her mansion gave her relief.</p>
               <p>Monteafiere jumped up and did not look to be the fearless man he should have been,
                  and he grasped his sword hilt with a weak hand. He had always ordered the
                  domestics to delay anybody's entrance so as to give him time to hide or to escape.
                  It was time to do the latter. He hastened to press a kiss upon the yielding yet
                  plump lips of the Lais. She, while mechanically suffering the salute, used one of
                  her hands in what appeared to be a caress but was that "wire dip" known then as
                  now to pickpockets.</p>
               <p>Monteafiere rushed from the room and upstairs to get away over the roof-tops,
                  while a sound of steps coming up the stairs made him speed quicker and the
                  mistress smile in anticipation.</p>
               <p>"Allesandro comes! Thank heaven. With this, we will give Venice good-bye," she
                  said as she looked at an object in her hand.</p>
               <p>The yellow card.</p>
               <p>The steps approached and the waiting-maid entered.</p>
               <p>"Signora, signora, Signor Allesandro took Pietro into the alley of Santa Maria
                  dell' Orto, where they found a woman and a child dead—just dead of hunger—skin and
                  bones, my lady! Then the signor flung down the bread and was going to fling away
                  the money he had in his pockets when he remembered himself, kissed the poor woman
                  and child, wept, sobbed himself quiet and then rushed off, saying he was going to
                  pay his debts, first to man, then to Nature!"</p>
               <p>"Kill himself!"</p>
               <p>"I'm afraid so," rejoined the servant.</p>
               <p>"My course is clear. Send me Alvarez the Spaniard and Pietro, quick."</p>
               <p>As the servant said, so had Massaroni acted on finding himself too late on the
                  return to Isalia. When convinced they were beyond earthly reach, he gave way to
                  heart-breaking rage till calm by exhaustion.</p>
               <p>Subdued in appearance till not a soul suspected his slumbering, volcanic feeling,
                  he entered the casino which had been the first step of his abandonment of the dead
                  one. On entering, he refused to drink with an acquaintance, and looked around for
                  some one. While searching, the object of his scrutiny came up to him and suddenly
                  said:</p>
               <p>"Beg pardon—wanted to see you—I've a debt to pay—can you—?"</p>
               <p>"Pay mine, Pottergeist? What does such a question mean?"</p>
               <p>"Just what I say. If you <emph>can</emph> pay me, do so."</p>
               <p>The ebbed blood flowed into his visage from his beart, but Massaroni only
                  approached the nearest table and flung upon it the contents of his pockets.</p>
               <p>"Count," said he to the Austrian.</p>
               <p>"Three crowns short," answered the latter.</p>
               <p>Allesandro pulled a ring off his finger.</p>
               <pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC8324-00000074"/>
               <p>"You was with me under the Palazza Mocenigo when I bought it——"</p>
               <p>"I'm satisfied."</p>
               <p>At this moment, one of the coins slipped off to the ground.</p>
               <p>"You handle money less skilfully than cards," said Allesandro with raillery.</p>
               <p>"Do you mean I cheat at play?" furiously demanded the German.</p>
               <p>"<emph>I</emph> mean what I say," retorted the Italian.</p>
               <p>The Austrian's eyes launched fire, while the other's replied no less brilliantly.
                  A circle began to form.</p>
               <p>"If you're not as white of heart as saucy of tongue," said Pottergeist, "a
                     <unclear>ducth</unclear> alone can be what you're driving at."</p>
               <p>Before the speaker had finished, Allesandro did that act which anybody, and an
                  Italian above all, considers the height of insult. He spat in the hollow of his
                  hand and slapped the German's cheek. That cheek, and the whole face of course,
                  grew white as a virgin sheet, and he plunged his hand into his bosom for a weapon,
                  no doubt, but a murmur and the sight of so many round about, checked that
                  design.</p>
               <p>"Actions speak louder than words," remarked Massaroni. "I do want a duel to the
                  death with you, cheat!"</p>
               <p>"Single combat is prohibited strictly," said somebody.</p>
               <p>"Silence!" shouted twenty voices, "gentlemen do not run after the police!"</p>
               <p>"Come!" cried Massaroni, "come into the fencing hall—these gentlemen will be
                  seconds and witnesses."</p>
               <p>A rush was made into the designated room, for these casinos have reading-rooms,
                  libraries, and other apartments attached to the drinking saloon portion. The door
                  was closed. A couple of foils had the buttons snapped off, leaving an ugly jagged
                  point on each.</p>
               <p>"Before fighting, of course the victor will be let go undisturbed," said
                  Pottergeist.</p>
               <p>"Of course," answered the Italian, "Venitians are too much men of honor not to
                  make that a matter understood. But you shall not profit by the leave."</p>
               <p>"We'll see—thunder and lightning!"</p>
               <p>The long steel threads clashed in equal rage but with different result. At the
                  first engagement, Massaroni's shirt-sleeve was torn off his shoulder, but his
                  weapon ran deeply into the breast of the German who dropped mortally wounded.</p>
               <p>"Away!" shouted all.</p>
               <p>Allessandro darted out of the hall as if a fresh crime was not burdening his
                  shoulders.</p>
               <p>At the door, he came in contact with a man running towards the casino. It was
                  Monteafiere. With a wrestling trick, learnt in the country in his youth,
                  Allessandro "gave" the runner "the foot," and down he sprawled, his head cracking
                  against the doorpost in so severe a way that he was certain not to revive for some
                  moments. The victor in this surprise, very quickly and tranquilly removed the
                  senseless man's sword and belt and set off again, girding on the baldric as he
                  ran.</p>
               <p>While this was occurring, Sylvia had secured her jewels on her person and at
                  length, calling her maid she gave her a splendid pair of bracelets.</p>
               <p>"Take one of the serving men and haste to the Jew of whom the Count Cellini bought
                  these. Make him give you half of the value in cash. Bring it to San Marco Church,
                  at once."</p>
               <p>While this mission was in progress, Sylvia put on a couple of cloaks and slipped
                  out of the house privately. The night was growing darker, and the courtesan was
                  almost delighted to be under the gleam of the pendant lamps of the great church.
                  She surveyed the interior carelessly when all of a sudden her eyes rested on a
                  form kneeling under a painting of a minor saint: Saint Alexander.</p>
               <p>She softly approached.</p>
               <p>All was so hushed in the lonely edifice that she heard her heart leap. It was
                  Massaroni, praying to his patron saint.</p>
               <p>Should he try to retrieve his career of evil for the sake of the dead Isalia, or
                  continue it for the sake of his guilty self?</p>
               <p>While he wavered, a pair of soft arms embraced him, and lips touched his cheek,
                  Sylvia knelt beside him!</p>
               <p>"I love you. I must leave the city; will you come and be my joy; or not, and make
                  me a miserable outlaw?"</p>
               <p>"I will go with you! I have killed Pottergeist the German, and Monteafiere
                  perhaps—you did not know it!"</p>
               <p>"My brave and gallant Allessandro—an Alexander like of old, I love you all the
                  more! Come, come."</p>
               <p>"I was going to leave the city——"he began.</p>
               <p>"And I."</p>
               <p>"And the world!" added he hoarsely.</p>
               <p>"No, no, and break my heart? Loved one, dear, my life of lives! no, no!"</p>
               <p>And her lips found the way to his this time.</p>
               <p>When the maid who had been despatched on the errand came to the church she found
                  Massaroni, gloomy but resolved, beside her mistress.</p>
               <p>"Have you the money?" cried the latter.</p>
               <p>"Yes, but I could not be any sooner."</p>
               <p>"Very well. Go home. All there of mine is yours. Now, <emph>my</emph> Allessandro,
                  follow me to the shore."</p>
               <p>The rising wind and the obscurity foreboded a night such as the fugitives wished,
                  for the sbirri were sufficiently dangerous without the moon to guide them in the
                  chase. Hasty steps suddenly became audible behind them, after they had been
                  walking swiftly for a few seconds; they were by one of the three hundred bridges
                  of the Adriatic's Bride. They ran over it and hid themselves under the hanging
                  doorway of a second-hand clothes-man's shop.</p>
               <p>Several men came along and crossed the canal at a run.</p>
               <p>"Keep on to the left, while I take the right and see if any of the boats shelter
                  them," shouted a voice which the listeners recognized as Monteafiere's.</p>
               <p>They obeyed.</p>
               <p>"The safest course is to follow the wretch," said Massaroni. "He is alone and far
                  from dangerous."</p>
               <p>On he marched then, followed by his mistress. Soon they overtook Monteafiere, who
                  had stopped to awaken several gondoliers and ask them questions to which he got no
                  satisfactory answers, of course. He pursued his way swearing.</p>
               <p>Massaroni let him go on for a while, till he believed him to be far enough off,
                  when he strode directly up to a gondolier, tapped him on the shoulder and
                  whispered:</p>
               <p>"Fifty ducats for a trip to Trieste."</p>
               <p>"Who are you—are you the man they are after?" queried the boatman. "I shouldn't
                  take you for a thousand."</p>
               <p>"My man," interposed Sylvia, "you run no danger. See!"</p>
               <p>She displayed the yellow card, which put an end to his obstinacy.</p>
               <p>"I'm ready," said he to the astounded Massaroni.</p>
               <p>The two entered the boat, but, after they had snugly ensconced themselves, a man
                  presented himself just as the gondolier was unloosening the painter from its ring.
                  It was Monteafiere.</p>
               <p>"You're in danger, friend," said he. "I saw two shadows beside yourself here. I
                  forbid you to shove off in the name of ——"</p>
               <p>He had leaped on the boat, when a beautiful white arm—an arm which with its mate
                  had often been around him in compulsory embrace—arose over his<pb n="146-147"
                     xml:id="VAC8324-00000075"/> head, armed with the end of a broken oar and down
                  he went in the doorway of the cabin. Massaroni's hand could hardly have delivered
                  a more powerful blow than this of Sylvia's.</p>
               <p>"Push off!" said Allessandro.</p>
               <p>Stimulated by fear as well as by the ample pay, the boatman was soon cleaving the
                  boisterous water.</p>
               <p>"We are served!" said Sylvia, enfolding her lover in her arms.</p>
               <p>"But this man? what will we do with him? You can hardly have killed him."</p>
               <p>"I hope so," said she earnestly. "And how he must never look upon Venice or the
                  world anywhere again!"</p>
               <p>The presence of Monteafiere was to the courtesan a sleeping horror, for one word
                  from him would have changed her companion's love into scorn and even if she
                  revealed the true position of the senseless wretch, she could not hope to
                  reinstate herself. With a strength which her alarm gave her, she half raised the
                  lifeless form out of the hollow of the boat and tried to cast it overboard.</p>
               <p>"Stop!" cried Allessandro.</p>
               <p>But woman's hate is swift; the body was already vanishing in the crested
                  waves.</p>
               <p>"Signor," said the gondolier, "<emph>red galley</emph> is cruising to-night. I saw
                  her awful sides bloodily shining in the sunset as she went down the port. What
                  shall I answer if we're hailed?"</p>
               <p>"There!" replied Sylvia, panting yet with her emotion, "show them that card.
                  Trieste, Trieste, you must haste to it."</p>
               <p>Tossing the purloined pasteboard to the man, she drew her companion into the
                  little cabin and pressed him with frenzy to her bosom.</p>
               <p>"We are safe! We are happy!" said she.</p>
               <p>Massaroni, his brain too much in a whirl for him to think in the least calmly,
                  gave himself up to repose.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, the storm, which had hung over the Adriatic for the last two hours,
                  burst in all its violence, and the billows, heaved as high as if they were those
                  of the broader Mediterranean. The fragile gondola, ill adapted for rough weather,
                  hardly answered to the strokes of the oarsman. He called Msssaroni to his aid and,
                  with an air gloomy though respectful, asked him, to try his hand at propulsion
                  until he could take a rest.</p>
               <p>"You tempted me with your gold," said he, "and heaven punishes me for yielding to
                  it. San Marco! do you hear: a cannon shot. If the ships big as houses are in
                  danger, what chance has my poor boat? Row, signor, for I will soon need all my
                  strength—to swim, perhaps."</p>
               <p>Allessandro did his best at the oars, but his lack of skill rendered his good will
                  useless.</p>
               <p>"We'll be broadside to it if you go on so," said the gondolier impatiently.</p>
               <p>"Take the oars yourself, sirrah," interposed Sylvia, who was the most courageous
                  of all. "I double the promised sum if you bring me into Trieste."</p>
               <p>"That's something like! But if we go down—"</p>
               <p>"We cannot help it. But we will arrive, I say."</p>
               <p>The man retook the oars, and Allessandro returned to sit beside his companion who,
                  affecting weakness now, let herself recline on his breast. The waves rose and
                  rose, and the thunder, suddenly unloosed, rolled with few interruptions. The
                  flashes kept the eyes in a state of dazzlement.</p>
               <p>Suddenly the oars ceased to buffet the rollers, and the man his his face in horny
                  palms. A scream even issued from Sylvia's mouth and she turned aside in
                  horror.</p>
               <p>"Help, help!" faintly said a voice. "In the name of the Holy, give me help!"</p>
               <p>An enormous billow swept onward and broke near the bank. A zizzag of the electric
                  fluid ran along the crest down into the trough. Allessandro, bending his sight
                  towards where had come the voice, was seized like his companions with deep
                  affright, for there seemed to stand amid the spray that very Monteafiere who was
                  deemed dead.</p>
               <p>In truth, only stunned by Sylvia's blow, and brought to consciousness while the
                  plaything of the waters, he had been taken off to sea by a recoiling current and
                  caught by the reflux, was apparently driving back the gondola of his slayers. The
                  loss of blood which he had experienced had made him too weak to swim and he was
                  still living only by a miracle. On beholding the boat, a little hope had been
                  kindled within him and, not recognizing its occupants, he had gasped between two
                  mouthfuls of brine, his imploring cry.</p>
               <p>But his hour had come!</p>
               <p>The second wave broke over him and sent him under, and the third dashed him
                  against the gondola, while its snowy front reddened with his blood, and nothing
                  more was seen of him.</p>
               <p>"A spirit!" said the gondolier, rowing again. "Heaven have mercy on us!"</p>
               <p>"It will not have mercy on me," groaned Massaroni in despair. "How many horrors
                  the last few hours have deluged me with. Oh, Sylvia! were it not for you, I would
                  plunge into the deep to join my happier victims."</p>
               <p>The courtesan, spray-bedewed, exhausted, terrified, was too much affected to
                  answer. She could not fill her lover with energy which she was far from having
                  herself. Silence reigned over the bark, except the soughing of the wind and the
                  prayers of the boatman.</p>
               <p>Finally, the tempest sensibly abated, and the first gleams of the dawn appeared,
                  while the gondola became more manageable. The fugitives breathed again, and
                  indulged in mutual caresses. The boatman especially hailed the day break.</p>
               <p>"Here we are all right, I hope! Holy Virgin! but my little boat has done her
                  duty—not a one of my mates' could have breasted such hillocks of foam. But,
                  goodness of heaven! how are we bearing! Thunder! the wind shifted in the dusk, and
                  here we are turned round so that San Marco's dome is in sight. And—oh, signor,
                  signor, back into the cabin! here comes the red galley—hide yourselves!"</p>
               <p>Indeed, from one side, bore down upon the gondola a six-oared galley of an
                  appaling character.</p>
               <p>Blood-red were its sides; its prow and stern and its large cabin, with ample
                  hangings, being scarlet as well, the only relief being embroidery in shiny black
                  silk. A lantern was stuck in the ornamented beak, which bore a gilt lion, and its
                  glass sides, broken by slaps of waves, however, were stained red. The oarsmen were
                  attired in sable imitation velvet, as were four sbirri holding muskets. As the
                  barge approached, a black-robed man, wearing a silk mask and cap with one long
                  plume, appeared in the cabin entrance.</p>
               <p>It had evidently been out all night, and was returning to Venice.</p>
               <p>"In the name of Messer Grand, grand high servitor of the Inquisitors of the State
                  and prime executioner of the ever-just orders of the honored council of Ten,"
                  chanted another black robe appearing behind the first, evidently a secretary,
                  "cease motion, gondolier!"</p>
               <p>He was obeyed.</p>
               <p>"You are out pearly for customers; have you any within!" went on the clerk.</p>
               <p>"I couldn't help it, a will stronger than mine drove me out of port," answered the
                  gondolier.</p>
               <p>"Oh, the tempest," said the clerk who seemed in good humor.</p>
               <p>"No, a power higher even than that," said the boatman, affecting a great be lief
                  in his blasphemy, as he displayed the yellow card and jerked his thumb
                  signficantly towards his cabin, which had been the object of the Messer's
                  scrutiny.</p>
               <pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC8324-00000076"/>
               <p>"Ah!" said the latter, speaking instead of his clerk this time, "go on, sorry to
                  have detained you. Bound to Trieste?"</p>
               <p>The gondolier looked grave and important.</p>
               <p>"Very well. Wherever you land, spread the news that the murderers of Duke Doscarli
                  of Barberigo are caught and in our power," said the Messer proudly and loudly.</p>
               <p>Two men, bound hand and foot, were indeed inside the cabin of the barge, which now
                  moved off rapidly under the stout arms of the six men. The little gondola resumed
                  its course until the galley was a mere crimson dot on the grey waters.</p>
               <p>Day was come.</p>
               <p>The gondolier shipped his oars, entered the cabin, opened a locker and took out a
                  bottle, whose large mouth was capped with a pewter cup which was also the stopper.
                  He offered his patron a drink, which did Massaroni good, and took two or three
                  times the same dose with much gusto. He took to the oars again, fresh as a rose,
                  he said:</p>
               <p>"And up comes the sun—huzza! warm me, old boy of brightness! for I never hoped to
                  see you again, yellow-face!" said he.</p>
               <p>The god of gladness had indeed pierced the clouds and poured his startling beams
                  over the scarcely soothed scene. The Adriatic was level enough to reflect in the
                  distance the sails of moored ships, and of fishing boats leaving port. The sky and
                  land were assuming that loveliness which is elsewhere known in only Turkey, India,
                  Oceanica and parts of America.</p>
               <p>Massaroni was affected by the beauty, and by the beauty of the woman by his side.
                  Her words so coincided with his thoughts that, on landing at Trieste, Allessandro
                  Massaroni was ready to be whatever that enchantress desired. His all was
                  complete.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>THE BRIGAND'S STORY CONTINUED.—STEEL TO THE LOVER, LEAD TO THE GIRL, FIRE TO
                     THE ROOF!—THE DEFEAT.—MASSARONI'S AVENGER.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>YEARS passed, (continued Joaquin) and Allessandro the brigand had upreared a
                  barrier between him and society of every species of crime, cemented with blood. At
                  times, he entered the circles in which he felt him so stained and unworthy, but
                  the end always was, a new exploit and a deeper dive into the abyss of guilt. The
                  mountains were his retreat. He was head of a band of adventurers, outlaws like
                  himself.</p>
               <p>It was the middle of the afternoon, but the bright sun but dimly flittered through
                  the brushwood and a winding entrance into a large cavern, half natural, half
                  artificial.</p>
               <p>Forty or fifty men with nearly as many females were drinking and revelling by the
                  light of some fine wax tapers which had been intended for the churches, but had
                  been captured by the banditti.</p>
               <p>At the head of the immense but rough table, strangely covered with rich damask,
                  more plunder, and plate, were a young man and a woman not young, but so
                  exceedingly bewitching and superb yet that no one could fail to recognize Sylvia
                  the courtesan of Beautiful Venice.</p>
               <p>"He's gone again; oh, how can Allessandro so leave me?" sighed she.</p>
               <p>"All the better! may it be for the halter," said her young gallant, embracing
                  her.</p>
               <p>"No, no," cried another of the band, "if he is ever to be taken, let us give him
                  up, along with Carlotti, and receive pardon with the reward. But you're so eager
                  to succeed to Massaroni; yes, you are, Giulio, that you forget even your own
                  interest."</p>
               <p>Giulio, as he was called, laughed, and, encircling Sylvia's waist, kissed her
                  unceremoniously.</p>
               <p>"You see, as regards fair Sylvia, I have already entered into the succession. The
                  command of the troop comes next. With her, I will have the secret of Allessandro's
                  treasure. She alone, with Carlotti, knows where it is buried.</p>
               <p>The courtesan, who was thus playing false, was immersed in reverie, yielding
                  herself to Giulio's words. At these last words she started:</p>
               <p>"The treasure!" echoed she; "yes, I do know where it is, and it was by my advice
                  that Allessandro concealed it past all your searches. So long as that is secret,
                  he can trust himself among you; it is a curb to your thoughts of treachery, for
                  you have no cause to injure him, if I have."</p>
               <p>Excited by drink, for she drank like the thirstiest man among them, she stood up
                  and waved her arms over the table, like a priestess of antiquity.</p>
               <p>"Oh, I would give all you, my love, that treasure, to have Allessandro all mine
                  again. I loved him with a true love! Yes, look at me in surprise! what care I?
                  When I see Allessandro moody, when I hear him curse and swear in reply to my
                  passionate words, when, exhausted by my entreaties, I wait for one kiss or one
                  word to prove he will be the Massaroni of old still again, when I am crouched at
                  his feet like a slave—when he then repulses me—Oh, I'd give the world to make
                  things otherwise! no wonder I threw myself into your arms, Giulio; wounded pride,
                  scorned love, make me yours. I laugh, sing, and chatter, but my tortures won't
                  sleep—will they ever?"</p>
               <p>She tossed off a great cup of a hot preparation of wine, spices, and limes.</p>
               <p>"But if my Allessandro—handsome, brave Allessandro—becomes once more the man who
                  so well answered to my love, I will forget all. But he rejects me, and if ever he
                  is mine, 'tis only when liquor has mastered him. Malediction! perhaps he loves
                  elsewhere! no doubt he does! Who, who? I'll—I'll make her heart bleed! Jealous,
                  jealous—that's the word for my life. Drink drink, let me drown my woes, let me
                  forget how I sowed, how I reap!"</p>
               <p>Another goblet she emptied, and fell into Giulio's arms. The robbers laughed at
                  her ravings.</p>
               <p>"She's half drunk, Giulio," whispered some one. "Give her more, and talk the
                  secret out of her."</p>
               <p>"You lie, knave, I have all my reason," said Sylvia, fiercely. "Sing, Guilio,
                  sing! Shout, roal, you men!"</p>
               <p>The orgie arose more frantically than ever, and all were as joyful as if they did
                  not hatch treason against the cheif.</p>
               <p>Where was he? Wending his was unsuspiciously towards the little village of Velma,
                  on the banks of the Isonzo River.</p>
               <p>The mayor of this hamlet has finished his late dinner of grapes and coarse bread,
                  and was enjoying the siesta, so welcome to a man of fifty like him.</p>
               <p>As he was aroused by ringing of the church bell, he sat up, stamped his foot
                  angrily and cried:</p>
               <p>"Rosalia! Rosalia! curses on your love of dress. She'll make me lose my
                  mayorality. Rosalia! it's time."</p>
               <p>"So I thought, and I'm ready," said a very pretty girl, appearing in the porch
                  suddenly. "Am I well enough looking?"</p>
               <p>"Five hundred times better bait than the shark deserves! you look like a
                  bride."</p>
               <p>"Much you know of dress to say that, father. I hope to be much gayer when I wed
                  the Lieutenant Salvator Rocco."</p>
               <pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC8324-00000077"/>
               <p>"You've too much tongue! if you keep on chattering, the vulture may be on the
                  wing; then good-bye to my mayoralty and Salvator's captaincy in prospect. Go, go,
                  my dear Rose, lose no time. Heaven guard you. Be prudent. Settle things as we have
                  agreed. Oh, women, women," mused he as his daughter fluttered up the road, "what
                  vines to train properly. She is as good as the best, and yet she's not worth the
                  rope that hangs her."</p>
               <p>While this parental and philosophical opinion was being expressed, the subject of
                  it was threading the defiles of the mountains, where the shadows began to
                  thicken.</p>
               <p>She did not perceive that a man was following her at a great distance.</p>
               <p>He wore the green and yellow uniform of the royal border guard, and was the
                  Lieutenant already mentioned.</p>
               <p>He carried his sword ready drawn in his hand.</p>
               <p>"Confound it!" ejaculated he at last "now, which way did she go? I ought to have
                  kept closer to her."</p>
               <p>He had lost his pilot, but he did not give up the search.</p>
               <p>At length after an hour's rambling, he crept up to a thicket, where a man's voice
                  alternated with Rosalia's softer one.</p>
               <p>Could the officer have seen as well as he heard, he would have bounded instantly
                  to the spot. Allessandro the brigand was replacing the meaner earrings of the girl
                  with another pair, which a princess might have envied. Were the diamonds as pure
                  as they seemed? Not likely, for they had come by the challenge of "Stand and
                  deliver!"</p>
               <p>Rosalia could suspect this, but she made no resistance, either from indifference
                  to their origin or from yielding to a delight for jewelry which many females old
                  and young have a weakness for.</p>
               <p>"How handsome!" breathed she.</p>
               <p>"Never mind them, Rose of love," murmured the mountain chief, "I implore you to be
                  my friend—friend, friend! for can I ask the greater title? Oh, I have so often
                  been visited by your image, so often have tried to kiss you in dreams! But waking
                  or sleeping, I have always respected you as a sister. I never had a sister, Rose!
                  You are weeping, child——"</p>
               <p>She was weeping, more over herself than for Allessandro, but she could not lay
                  bare the source of her burning tears.</p>
               <p>"Have you indeed pity even for me, Massaroni the brigand?"</p>
               <p>"Massaroni!" echoed Lieutenant Salvator, whose sword clanked in his nervous
                  grasp.</p>
               <p>A silence ensued. The robber was awaiting the response which the young girl could
                  not utter. Her hand was in his own; he drew her to him, their hearts beat
                     <emph>against</emph> one another—<emph>not as one!</emph> Was it an augury?
                  thought the bandit.</p>
               <p>"What must I say?" she murmured, her tear-bathed face close to his burning
                  one.</p>
               <p>The contact of her pure breath on his lips that had been often scorched by the
                  fiery Sylvia, fanned the flame within him. He kissed her fervently. Suddenly she
                  tore herself from his enclasping arms, and moaned:</p>
               <p>"I am a wretch! Do you know why I am here?"</p>
               <p>Truth and the spur of conscience were the stronger, and doubtlessly she would have
                  told the robber what an infamous part she had been induced to perform, but the
                  listener had judged it high time to interfere, and made his unexpected appearance,
                  sword in hand.</p>
               <p>"To-morrow, she was to sell you to us," cried Salvator, falling upon Massaroni. "I
                  gain a day, brigand, in taking you now!"</p>
               <p>The lieutenant had understood in an instant the whole plot of his would-be
                  father-in-law.</p>
               <p>But the officer's impetuosity was useless to him; quicker than he, Allessandro had
                  leaped up, put aside the thrust with one arm, and plunged his dagger into his
                  breast. The lieutenant fell forward on his face, and drove the blade up to the
                  very hilt by striking the ground. Not a word, groan or sound did he make.</p>
               <p>Rosalia had fallen on her knees before the outlaw, whose tall form towered over
                  the dead man and her, who was half expiring.</p>
               <p>"Did that man speak true?" inquired Allessandro in a hoarse tone, as he drew a
                  pistol.</p>
               <p>"Yes, but listen—I would not have betrayed you, for I love——"</p>
               <p>An ironical laugh and the report of the fire-arm was all the answer to this
                  exclamation coming from the depths of the poor girl's heart. A second corpse
                  poured out its warm blood on the soil which had drank up the man's.</p>
               <p>"The whole world is against me!" yelled the brigand, hurling his weapon far from
                  him, and rushing into the wood. "Purity and innocence are leagued against me. I
                  will war now to the death!"</p>
               <p>About an hour after dark, some one knocked at the door of the mayor's cottage.
                  Thinking it was his belated daughter returned at last, he hurried down to open
                  it.</p>
               <p>"Well, have your winning ways——"</p>
               <p>"They brought her death—there it is!" shouted Allessandro, felling him to the
                  ground.</p>
               <p>With a rage that awoke all his immense energy, he burst into the house, flung an
                  old servant whom he met from top to bottom of the stairs, kicked the fire round
                  the room and with one brand kindled the beds. He sallied out with a last kick at
                  the mayor's body that sent it away out into the garden, and tossed his torch into
                  the barn as he ran past. The blaze sent its rays even to the mountain haunt.</p>
               <p>"Friends," thundered the brigand, as he appeared before the carousers, "I have
                  heard your mutterings. Come out and see if Massaroni the brigand has a dead
                  hand!"</p>
               <p>A few of the drunkards staggered out to glance at the conflagration, which was
                  spreading in the hamlet, and then dropped into the cave again.</p>
               <p>"The g—g—good old Captain again!" stammered one. "Hurray for the old times e—come
                  again!"</p>
               <p>"Sylvia, here!" roared the brigand chief crazily. "Some drink, and your glorious
                  self!"</p>
               <p>Sylvia crawled tremblingly up to her master's feet and executed slavishly whatever
                  he drunkenly demanded.</p>
               <p>When the news of these three murders spread throughout the district, great
                  indignation and wrath was excited. People became ashamed of their fears of the
                  band, and their courage was fed by the reinforcements of troops that were sent
                  into the region.</p>
               <p>The banditti spies informed him of all the preparations which had become so
                  formidable that flight alone offered itself. The cave was sure to be found out
                  eventually.</p>
               <p>Massaroni made the valuables be packed and had all his force in readiness to move
                  that night. Darkness was necessary for the march unseen of so many men.</p>
               <p>"Giulio," ordered the chief, "send out the men to scout and study the ground for
                  our move to-night."</p>
               <p>Three of the bandits started off, after receiving private instructions from the
                  traitor. They boldly descended from the heights, and as boldly followed the
                  highway. Before long they came upon a sentinel who cried out "to arms!" and
                  levelled his musket at them.</p>
               <p>A corporal and his squad surrounded the trio and marched them along with<pb
                     n="152-153" xml:id="VAC8324-00000078"/> them into the presence of a number of
                  soldier's and country police. The bandits began to repent of their imprudence.</p>
               <p>"Who are you?"</p>
               <p>"Outlaws."</p>
               <p>"Aha!" said the speaker, the new mayor of Velma, "so you belong to those wretches,
                  whom we're going to settle?'</p>
               <p>"We did belong to them of late. We have come to propose a treaty, by which we,
                  will give you up our leader Massaroni, who is the really guilty man."</p>
               <p>"A treaty!" said the colonel commanding. "Well you are a saucy set. We will have
                  your leader and all his crew without striking hands with you, my fine fellows. The
                  mountain is covered with troops."</p>
               <p>"You'll only lose the lives of many a brave man, sir. Give me and my friends here
                  and the others we left behind, our lives, and you shall have our captain bound
                  like a sheep, in half an hour."</p>
               <p>"You're a shame-faced knave," said the officer.</p>
               <p>"Colonel Lucca," replied the bandit, "two years ago you did not call your comrade
                  Cesario Marani that."</p>
               <p>The blood flushed up in the officer's face.</p>
               <p>"On my soon! you are Cesario—the lieutenant in my Albanian regiment two years ago!
                  you in such company?"</p>
               <p>"Who could help it, Colonel, a lieutenant's pay is petty. Stretch a point for an
                  old friend and fellow soldier, and let me go sardine-catching the rest of my
                  life."</p>
               <p>At the word "friend" used by a bandit to an officer so proud as he, the Colonel's
                  confusion changed into wrath.</p>
               <p>"My friend the Mayor," said he, turning to that official. "I flatter myself that
                  my character is above this rogue's aspersions. I did know him, true enough, but he
                  had not so deeply disgraced himself. He wants me to stretch a point for him for
                  the sake of Auld Lang Syne, does he! Mr. Mayor, have the kindness to make him
                  stretch one out of the bundle of rope we have along with us."</p>
               <p>"We are under flag of truce," said Cesario stoutly. "We are sacred according to
                  the laws of war."</p>
               <p>"We'll <emph>sacrifice</emph> you, my gallant wolves, and so we will your mates,"
                  said the Colonel.</p>
               <p>"If you delay us, Massaroni will escape!"</p>
               <p>"But you'll not escape," said the mayor. "Finish with these rascals," added he to
                  a couple of ugly devils who looked like the hangmen they were. "Their own
                  confession convicts them. Any tree will be good enough gibbet."</p>
               <p>The three robbers, stared at one another. They had not foreseen any such
                  disagreeable sequel to their faithlessness, and could hardly realize their
                  position.</p>
               <p>"You'll regret what you're doing, my sirs," said Cesario, essaying to talk himself
                  out of the scrape. "The true and only guilty one of all the crimes set down to us,
                  is our captain. We poor fellows never shed blood."</p>
               <p>"Well, we'll not shed yours, be satisfied," interrupted the mayor impatiently.</p>
               <p>On his sign, the two Jack Ketches stepped up to the bandits to pinion them, but
                  their approach restored the wretches their energy. They were disarmed, but they
                  knocked aside the soldiers and rushed for cover of the bushes.</p>
               <p>"Fire!" shouted the colonel.</p>
               <p>A rattle of musketry resounded, and two of the fugitives were seen dimly through
                  the smoke to fall, riddled with lead, among the brush. Cesario hesitated a moment,
                  half fell, but, almost instantly, resumed his flight up to acclivity and vanished
                  from the clumsier pursuers.</p>
               <p>"You, fellows, must get your hand in," remarked the mayor facetiously. "String up
                  those two."</p>
               <p>In a trice, the bleeding bodies swung in the air from the nearest tree.</p>
               <p>"That volley will have given the banditti the alarm, colonel," observed the
                  mayor.</p>
               <p>"No matter. My orders are out for the advance from all sides. The wretches are
                  surrounded."</p>
               <p>The outlaws had heard the discharge, but they waited still. Several of them with
                  cords ready, had kept near Massaroni, to bind him at the signal from Giulio.</p>
               <p>All of a sudden, quickly falling footsteps were heard and Cesario appeared, his
                  hand deeply buried in his side, his lips red with an internal bleeding, his eyes
                  a-glow, in every lineament and every limb—except that no triumph was on his brow—a
                  model of the Spartan youth who ran himself to death to bring the news of the
                  battle to the Senate.</p>
               <p>"They give to quarter—fight, fight, and avenge us, comrades!" gasped he with
                  bloody from between every word. "They come! may this wipe out my—my
                  treach—er—y!"</p>
               <p>He fell back into his friend's arms, a corpse.</p>
               <p>"Thank heaven!" murmured Sylvia, who ran to Massaroni and embraced him with a joy
                  he could not understand. "Your only hope, my men, is in your protector and
                  chief!"</p>
               <p>"Massaroni forever!" was the universal cry.</p>
               <p>Giulio had no longer a party.</p>
               <p>"Ready all!" said Allessandro, "ready all for ploughing our way through the
                  foe?"</p>
               <p>"All! all!"</p>
               <p>Giulio instantly set out with the women and beggage, and a sufficient escort, with
                  orders to use the secret ways he so well knew. Scouts went out at the same time,
                  but very soon returned. From every quarter, they said, the enemy was
                  advancing.</p>
               <p>"Captain," reported the last, "I saw from the mountain's brow, two men hanged.
                  They must be our poor friends."</p>
               <p>"No doubt."</p>
               <p>"The southern defiles are full of countrymen," said this same man, "they are not
                  well armed and we can beat them."</p>
               <p>"Very well. We will do it. But if we must fly," added Massaroni, "still will we
                  avenge our comrades. Follow me."</p>
               <p>Giulio was gone, and with him his baleful influence. The outlaw had re-assumed his
                  former tone of command which admitted of no reply. The state of things, too,
                  permitted no grumbling or wavering. They followed their captain, who penetrated a
                  little-used branch of the subterraneous.</p>
               <p>Three kegs of powder had been properly arranged, with a match, which the last of
                  the file was to ignite. The banditti streamed along hurriedly, laden with spoil
                  and weapons, in haste to quit the underground retreat which had so long been their
                  asylum and was soon to be fatal to their hunters.</p>
               <p>They breathed the fresh air at length, having come out on a distant hill-side of
                  which they had never suspected the connection with their place of refuge. The rear
                  guard had fired a few shots, in the neighborhood of the cavern.</p>
               <p>"That will not fail to attract them," said Massaroni. "May a thousand of our
                  enemies meet death for their blood-thirstiness."</p>
               <p>Almost as he spoke, and while all watched, a sound as of distant thunder rumbled,
                  and the ground shook. A tall pyramid of flame, smoke and dust, intermingled with
                  huge masses of rock and fragments of trees, rose and stood on its point where the
                  cavern had been. All fell thereupon, and the earth quaked once more, till a more
                  profound silence reigned all around.</p>
               <p>A very distant detonation broke it first of all.</p>
               <p>"Giulio has cut his way through," exclaimed the brigand chief, after listening.
                  Good! Let us try our luck against the clods in the southern passes."</p>
               <pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC8324-00000079"/>
               <p>They tried their chance against the peasantry who, poorly armed as they were,
                  nevertheless, made such a resistance that no more than fifteen of the robbers
                  contrived to break through the lines. The rest, dead or crippled, fell into the
                  countrymen's hands. Massaroni bleeding at seven wounds from club, pitchfork and
                  scythe-pole, and with a broken arm, made the victorious party forget how many had
                  perished in the blown-up cave.</p>
               <p>Massaroni was hanged, though Giovanni Carlotti, his faithful lieutenant (who had
                  unfortunately not been at his side during his captain's last adventures) made a
                  galliant attempt to escape him.</p>
               <p>For three nights, soldiers watched the gibbet to prevent a rumcred trial to obtain
                  the body. On the fourth, it was removed by whom none knew.</p>
               <p>Months passed.</p>
               <p>A man was swiftly dragging a woman along up the side of a mountain. The man was
                  Giulio the traitor, she Sylvia. Not a word left the lips of either, as they ran
                  upwards.</p>
               <p>Suddenly Sylvia stopped, wrenched free her arm, and sat herself down on a large
                  table of stone that jutted over a tremendously deep precipice. In the valley
                  below, the first object that attracted the eyes of anybody was a little mound on
                  the side of the hollow, which earned its prominence from being covered with a
                  coarsely hewn but beautiful slab of marble, white as white could be. On it were
                  riveted the eyes of the seated woman.</p>
               <p>"Why, Sylvia, what ails you?" growled Giulio, seeing that she seemed determined
                  not to move. "Forget your fatigue till we give them the slip."</p>
               <p>She, with an effort, removed her gaze from that snowy spot on the dark green and
                  brown, and regarded the speaker fixedly. She shook her head, and responded:</p>
               <p>"I wish to avoid my thoughts, not our comrades who follow us."</p>
               <p>"Oh, none of your nonsense, Sylvia. Massaroni's dead, and you ought to be
                  satisfied now."</p>
               <p>"Dead! so he is, for that (and she pointed) is the grave of the leader you sought
                  to sell."</p>
               <p>"That!" echoed he, following the direction of her wasted arm, extending
                  downward.</p>
               <p>"Under that slab, no whiter, no purer than was his soul when I first won him to my
                  breast, lies Allessandro Massaroni, whom I made a brigand," said the courtesan,
                  becoming beautiful again and magical in tone from the truthfulness of her speech.
                  "Carlotti and I there interred him."</p>
               <p>"The deuce. Who'd have dreamed that's where he vanished. But, a truce to that.
                  Haste Sylvia, till we avoid our too good friends, and unearth the treasure you
                  know of, alone. Come, come, we will roll in riches and luxury! Quick, I fear I
                  hear them! Come, you strange woman. I love you—you ought to give me the treasure!
                  Up, up! Satan seize you—they come! Will you rise! 'S death, —— swallow me, but you
                  shall come!"</p>
               <p>Putting forth all his strength, he tried to lift the smiling woman, but she said
                  bitterly:</p>
               <p>"Too late, my dear Giulio!"</p>
               <p>True, for a number of the bandits appeared and surrounded their captain,
                  threatingly demanding a reason for his flight.</p>
               <p>"You are cheating us—We own as much of the spoil as you—You promised us fair
                  shares or we wouldn't have turned on Massaroni and left Carlotti after—We'll make
                  your life answer for your false play—Kill him!—The treasure, the treasure, Giulio,
                  or I'll knife you, by the ears of Saint Paul!" were some of their savage
                  outcries.</p>
               <p>"Sylvia, where is the hiding place?" cried others. "Your blood or the money!"</p>
               <p>The woman started as if the barb had touched a bleeding wound.</p>
               <p>She knew—who does not too soon find it out?—that she was no longer the very
                  handsome woman she had once been, when she was the admired of every young man that
                  knew her. That was in the days of her innocence, when even the hint of an evil
                  thought would purple her round cheek, when she could look up at an image of the
                  Madonna with eyes innocent as her own. No wonder that the fallen woman
                  started.</p>
               <p>But she regained her coolness by an effort and rejoined:</p>
               <p>"In my abasement, I am still above you, for a grand and noble passion burns, if
                  impurely, still in my heart. I have said I will not go with you, so leave me. Must
                  I eternally repeat it?"</p>
               <p>"But how can you drag out existence? Alone now in the cruel world, you have but me
                  to lean on, I love you, do you hear? Come!"</p>
               <p>Not a syllable did she make answer with. Giulio and the others fancied that she
                  was selecting and, to make her decide, they drew nearer.</p>
               <p>"Giulio hits it," said one, "where will you go, if not with him or us? of course
                  he loves you yet, you are bella donna still, the pride of the band, by San Pietro
                  del Castello, I'll swear to that!"</p>
               <p>"Have done with this!" broke in others, the more ferocious.</p>
               <p>Giulio, seeing their choler rise anew grasped the woman by the arm rudely.</p>
               <p>"You have promised us the treasure. Yield it, or——"</p>
               <p>"Or, what?" returned she, not even shrinking at the pain.</p>
               <p>"I will make you sorry!"</p>
               <p>"Strike me, dastard!" exclaimed the robber's mistress, flaming up into the
                  spirited courtesan of younger days.</p>
               <p>"Worse than that! I'll—I'll hurl thee over into this abyss, only less deep than
                  the gap to hell!"</p>
               <p>"Coward! enough!"</p>
               <p>So saying, she rose, shook him off as if he were a feather and his grasp a
                  child's, and stood up before all the brigands. She drew from her bosom a key which
                  became the the pole-star to their eyes.</p>
               <p>"With this bit of bronze," she began in measured tone. "I can make each of ye
                  richer than a Russian noble, an English lord, a French duke, an Orsini or a
                  Borgia! But on one condition!"</p>
               <p>They moved their lips in avidity and in mute promise of accepting any
                  proposition.</p>
               <p>"I left Allessandro," continued she, "because he shunned me and wounded my pride.
                  Do you think I would bear more, scorn and insult, from this Giulio, who only
                  reigned over me by help of my jealousy? He threatens to hurt, to kill me—he is
                  only fit for woman-murder! Let him die, and the whole is yours! He tried to rob
                  you of your shares—avenge yourselves!"</p>
               <p>At first astounded by the unexpected outbreak, Giulio speedily recovered himself.
                  He drew his knife and moved towards his denouncer.</p>
               <p>"If you touch me, this beldame dies!" screamed he with ghastly face.</p>
               <p>But the eager subjects of rapacity had had their impatience augmented by the fresh
                  temptation which Sylvia had with the subtlety that her sex, learnt of the Serpent
                  (so they say), glittered before them.</p>
               <p>Giulio had barely spoken the words above, than he leaped in air, perforated by a
                  score of balls. His blood actually spirted on Sylvia, who watched him, fiendishly
                  rejoicing, as he writhed in the last gasp.</p>
               <p>"He's gone," said one of the slayers', busy stripping the body. Now for your
                  promise."</p>
               <p>Sylvia mounted up on the great flat crag that had been her seat, and from that
                  pedestal, said exaltedly:</p>
               <p>"The place whither I go is far away. Ye who hearken to me and ask me to<pb
                     n="156-157" xml:id="VAC8324-00000080"/> guide you into possession of a treasure
                  beyond price, shall not be deceived in your hopes. But have you the courage to
                  follow me?"</p>
               <p>"Guide us, and you'll see," said all in one voice.</p>
               <p>"The journey is long, but the way easy."</p>
               <p>"Speak. Whither? To the world's end we'd go?</p>
               <p>"So eager, eh?" continued she, but turning to hover over the awful guif. "Come! I
                  know of no treasure so priceless as that in yonder grave! I lead to
                  it—Allessandro, my love—or—"</p>
               <p>Before a hand could check her, the woman had leaped away out into the chasm. In
                  the calm air she turned twice or thrice, but struck upon the slab many feet
                  beneath which had been the aim of her terrific leap. She rolled off it, a mangled
                  corpse. Its white was splashed with blood.</p>
               <p>A curse from the lips of all the baffled men was the sound that followed her in
                  the fall to meet her death rattle coming up!</p>
               <p>The extreme prudence, over caution we may say, which the captain had generaly
                  exercised, was displayed in the trifling case we cite. One evening when he felt
                  thirsty and yet dared not go into a public house, he sent to San Jose from the
                  rancho an Indian to get him a bottle of brandy. Hardly had his messenger departed
                  than a misgiving seized him, he jumped upon his horse, made a circuit, cut off the
                  redskin and killed him on the road passing Coyote Creek.</p>
               <p>Such were the unceasing tolls executed by the brigands throughout the state, such
                  their violence, cruelty, rapacity, in all their acts, that the people could not
                  stand it any longer.</p>
               <p>It was no joke to hard working men in the towns or the mines when Jim or Joe,
                  hearing the cry "Bill or Tom's found dead—murdered by those bloody devils of
                  Joaquin's!" would throw down tools and sling one leg over a horse and gallop off
                  with Dick and Harry to try to catch the assassins.</p>
               <p>So the "hard-fists" and the "silk-stockings," few, however, began to cover the
                  blank of a petition with signatures, for presentation to the Senate to obtain for
                  Captain Harry Love authority to form a company of mounted riflemen, with whom he
                  could scour the country and clear it of all the wretches who imperiled life and
                  property of the law-abiding. A law was passed to this effect and signed by the
                  Governor, May the 17th, 1853.</p>
               <p>The Claude Duval of California had been running a three years' race.</p>
               <p>On the twenty-eighth of the same month, by which you will see the Captain was
                  active, Harry Love had his troop mustered in. The pay was each man a hundred and
                  fifty dollars a month, the company to have three months existence, and no more
                  than twenty to be its number. Though the salary was a mere flea-bite, each trooper
                  had to furnish his horse, equipments, keep, and everything without any grounds for
                  indemnity, a proof how truly they were volunteers. Love had picked out his score
                  from comrades of his in the Texan and Mexican wars.</p>
               <p>Their names were Colonel McLane, Major W. H. Harvey, Captain P. E. Conner, Captain
                  W. Burns, Lieutenant George A. Mittall, Doctor D. S. Hollister, John Nuttall, C.
                  F. Bloodworth, G. W. Evans, W S. Henderson, C. W. McGowan, Robert Masters,
                  Lafayette Black, the Hon. P. S. Herbert, E. B. Van Dorn, Piggott, Norton and
                  Charles Young.</p>
               <p>These set out from San Francisco, pretty well determined that they would not set
                  eyes on the glorious bay and its Golden Gates unless they had had a tussle with
                  the bandit and come off first best. As the intrepid little band rode through the
                  towns and villages, they were cheered as they deserved to be, and, if they had
                  desired drink, they might have floated in liquor, for Californians used to
                  consider libations the only proper offering to a friend or one to whom Godspeed
                  was wished. Some feared that the party was too small but they were such as did not
                  know Harry Love, a man who had won his spurs in charges with heroes of the Jack
                  Hayes sort, and who had a mind superior in all points, from sagacity to
                  fearlessness, to even the audacious robber against whom he was pitted.</p>
               <p>The first thing Love set about doing, was to gain complete knowledge of the
                  enemy's movements, his last halting places, his freshest tracks, so that he might
                  fall upon him at the moment when a foe has least expected and in the place which
                  would be most favorable to him.</p>
               <p>On the third of June, the Pedro Sanchez who had been at San Francisco three months
                  before, with Three-fingered Jaok, was killed at Martinez near Columbia, by a
                  Spaniard named Albino Teba. They had been wrangling about some money that they had
                  stolen together, when Sanchez, enraged at his mate's obstinacy, had sprang upon
                  him knife in hand. Senor Teba had jumped back, whipped out his revolver and
                  bestowed four of its charges on his accomplice. Only one bullet hit, but that was
                  enough to blot Pedro's name off the rolls of the band.</p>
               <p>By a strange coincidence, on the very same day, Borilda had met his death at
                  Stockton for assassination. He had been charged by his chief to kill a Mexican who
                  had offended the latter, and in trying to carry out his orders, he had mortally
                  wounded one Janes, who had been in the same room with the Mexican doomed by
                  Joaquin. Borilda was proven guilty of the murder of three men and confessed his
                  share in other more or less important crimes. A day or two before his execution,
                  he had made himself master of a revolver on a table within his reach, and had
                  tried to kill himself, but it had missed fire.</p>
               <p>Joaquin Blanco, the third companion of Three-fingered Jack at San Francisco, was
                  killed at Stockton in the ensuing year by a countryman of the name of Eugenie
                  Cæsar.</p>
               <p>In the evening of the ninth of June, four of the thieves, having forty horses in
                  their charge, stopped at Andreas Harra's rancho, about twenty miles from San Luis
                  Rey and, without any provocation whatever, fired on the former's family and
                  wounded one of them. Then they pinioned three men in the house carried off all the
                  gold and valuables on which they could lay their hands. At San Marco, they killed
                  two young steers.</p>
               <p>Next day, a troop left San Diego to pursue them, but the impossibility of tracking
                  them after dark, forced them to throw up the chase then. Messages were sent to the
                  different Indian tribes for them to head the robbers off, but the latter had had
                  time to reach the mountains. A few days afterwards, eight horses were said to have
                  been taken at Santa Margarita.</p>
               <p>Pursued on all sides by relentless men at whose hands he, the offender, could
                  expect no mercy, fearing a defeat which would have compromised all his hopes and
                  designs so long hugged to his breast. Joaquin made up his mind to withdraw into
                  concealment until he should have the reinforcements from Sonora.</p>
               <p>In the commencement of July, Murieta took fifty head of horses from the rancho of
                  Don Andreas Rico, at San Fernando, Los Angelos County. He pushed on to the San
                  Francisco Rancho in the same county, where a ranchero told him bluntly that the
                  cattle belonged to Pico and that he had better make restitution or he would get
                  into trouble. Murietta actually restored all but seven of the stolen animals to
                  the ranchero, charging him to take them back to the owner. Then he crossed in
                  Santa Barbara County and crossed the highest sea-coast ground to Santa Inez,
                  whence he could easily go down into the Sular Valley.</p>
               <p>Acting upon secret intelligence giving him as certain the presence of the
                  arch-robbers in this district, Captain Love moved hitherward with a dozen men,
                  while the rest brightened their horses' shoes in other places. On crossing the
                  Sular plains, he perceived at day break a patch of smoke over on the left. This
                  common and unimportant sight to anybody else was of more weight to the<pb
                     n="158-159" xml:id="VAC8324-00000081"/> veteran ranger. He turned that way and
                  cautiously proceeded towards the smoke. First, he only saw a few horses hidden
                  five hundred yards or so from the fire, but, on drawing nearer yet and ascending a
                  low butte, he discovered on another mound the Mexican chief of marauders in person
                  and only six of his men.</p>
               <p>One of the latter, in cooking, discovered the enemy; he gave the alarm, but only
                  when the Americans were within a hundred yards of the encampment.</p>
               <p>The ravagers rushed to horse, while on spurred the rangers, who made prisoners of
                  two of the former in the onset.</p>
               <p>Joaquin had scrambled on his steed and was fleeing with such rapidity, that he had
                  a likelihood of escape, but Love, finding him nearly out of range, hastily put a
                  bullet in his horse's side. The noble animal shuddered for a moment but,
                  recovering the ardor in spite of its wound, bounded on again more im petuously
                  than ever for at least fifty yards. But Harry Love knew where a bullet fired by
                  him ought to strike, and he galloped on no wise despairing. Suddenly, sure enough,
                  the fugitive chief saw blood spout out of his horse's nostrils and drip from its
                  mouth, and down dropped the poor beast never to carry its own weight ever
                  more.</p>
               <p>The rider shook off the stirrups and ran on a-foot, but seeing the captain and one
                  of his men thundering down on him, he turned and discharged the last two loads in
                  his six shooter. At the same time a shower of missiles flew around him and he
                  tell. He begged his captors to fire no more.</p>
               <p>You've beat me—but only by surprise, he gasped, no matter! I'm satisfied—I've had
                  enough revenge——"</p>
               <p>Pale from loss of blook by several bullet holes, he pressed his left hand to his
                  breast, leaned on his other arm for a short space and at last gave up the
                  ghost.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile Three-fingered Jack had been galloping away, pursued by two or three of
                  the rangers. Though eleven bullets had found lodgement in his body, he rode for a
                  mile and a half. But though the chasers did not have horses as fine as his, they
                  were such skilled riders that they kept well up to him. At length finding he could
                  not shake them off, he wheeled to fire, but only one shot out of his six went off.
                  Five miss-fires told him all was against him. He would not surrender himself,
                  nevertheless, and as he swore he would resist to the last, Captain Conner dashed
                  up to him with a "spurt" of his horse, warded off a blow of the butt from the
                  Mexican and gave him a shot in return which killed him instantly.</p>
               <p>Fighting had been going on in the meantime at other points. When the rangers came
                  to rally around Captain Love, they brought with them two prisoners. One of the
                  bandits had been killed, name unknown. Two others had got off, but only one safe
                  and sound, for his partner had died on the road of wounds.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>THE PRISONERS' FATE.—JOAQUIN'S HEAD AND GARCIA'S HAND.—THE END.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>After this bloody skirmish, Captain Love collected the spoils; the valuable horses
                  which were restored to their real owners, six Mexican saddles more or less heavily
                  silvered, as many revolvers, silver spurs, fine cloaks and a pair of holster
                  pistols. As the successful rangers were returning to San Francisco, one of the
                  captives broke his bonds somehow and flung himself into a pool of water, where he
                  drowned himself. His companion was placed in the Mariposa County Jail, where he
                  remained until the capturing party was dissolved, when he was taken to Martinez.
                  There, he made a confession which proved the participation of a great number of
                  his country men in the crimes he had committed; he was going to make revelations
                  of more importance still in order to be state's evidence, when he was prevented
                  this. At midnight the prison doors were burst in by a mob of Mexicans, who took
                  him out and hanged him. As Mexicans had rarely been so eager to anticipate justice
                  by lynching, the belief is that these were active members of Joaquin's association
                  and rancheroes, who were desirous to cut short their repentant partner's
                  avowals.</p>
               <p>Love's men had only one object in view now: the obtaining of the rewards offered
                  throughout the country to the captors as slayers of the notorious murderer and
                  marauder. Most assuredly, they had earned the offers by the courage they had
                  displayed, the dangers which they had braved, and the steadfastness with which
                  they had pursued Murieta into the very midst of his band, and, to make evident
                  reasons short, by their whole conduct.</p>
               <p>The public of course had to be furnished with proofs of the facts.</p>
               <p>Otherwise it would never have been believed that the famous Joaquin had been
                  killed, despite all his worth. Captain Love would have had shameful suspicious
                  attached to his reputation. So he had to do what in other cases, he was too brave
                  to have dreampt of, that is give the order for Murieta's head to be cut off and
                  carried to the nearest town, a hundred and fifty miles off, to be preserved in
                  spirits.</p>
               <p>On the fourteenth of August, Black and Nuttal reached San Francisco from Stockton,
                  bearing the head of the famous highwayman, whose countless crimes had given him an
                  unparalleled name in the annals of wrong-doing.</p>
               <p>The astonishing rapidity of his actions, the number of his accomplices, the extent
                  of his operations over a region excessively vast, had united to set his name up
                  simultaneously in opposite quarters so often that some people actually deemed him
                  a myth, to whom was erroneously attributed all the guilt of all the malefactors in
                  the land. Even after his death, rumor would have it that he was still in the
                  southern counties, continuing his system of daily murders and pillaging as in the
                  past the rancheroes and mining camps.</p>
               <p>But Black and Nuttall, besides the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">caput
                     mortuum,</foreign> brought with them numerous certificates from persons who had
                  been acquainted with Joaquin; it was therefore impossible to doubt the identity
                  and not credit the assertions of Captain Love and his gallant comrades.</p>
               <p>The head was on exhibition in order to let the people see and judge for
                  themselves. Thus ran the placard: <q>
                     <p>JOAQUIN'S HEAD can be seen at "<hi rend="i"/>King's." corner of Halleck and
                        Sansome Streets, opposite the American Theatre.<lb/> ADMISSION ONE

                  </q>

               <p>This happened (let us say to give another meed to the man of all deserying it,
                  though we go off our road), under the French Consulates, as the antique Romans say
                  of Monsieur Dillon, one of the most estimable of gentlemen, whose appointment to
                  his troublous position was an honor to his country, as to that of his residence,
                  and almost a blessing to the Queen City of the Pacific. Nor should we omit on this
                  occasion to speak in commendation of M. Moren heit, sometime French Consul at
                  Monterey, who was ever vigilant in aiding the authorities. Mons. M. was a true
                  type of the French gentleman.</p>
               <p>As we were saying, everybody and his wife and child, flocked to stare at the head
                  of the highway man, not an unhandsome one, by any means. We wonder, though, that
                  the lip did not curl with scorn and the eyes flash fire at the remarks which some
                  Yankee phrenologists passed on it, in our hearing. It was carried around into
                  different parts of the state, along with the three-fingered hand of Garcia, which
                  terrified certain superstitious people by its nails having grown at least an inch
                  since it had been severed from the wrist.</p>
               <p>After a formal verification, Colonel John Bigler, governor of the state, had paid
                  over to Captain Harry Love the sum of a thousand dollars which he had personally
                  promised to the captor of the bandit dead or alive. A little later May the 15th,
                  1854, the Senate, considering firstly that the ridding the land of such a scourge
                  had not been sufficiently rewarded, decreed that an additional sum of five
                  thousand dollars should be allowed.</p>
               <p>Although the death of their leader was an irreparable loss to his followers and
                  even compelled them to disband, they broke up into little parties and continued a
                  desultory skirmishing which sometimes made people fancy that the highway man's
                  spirit was up in arms again.</p>
               <p>Towards the end of '54, the head of Murieta was sold by Deputy Sheriff Harrison,
                  in virtue of a seizure for debt against the owner of the relic. While the bidding
                  was at its height, a voice, either Irish or a good imitation, and earnest or
                  well-feigned, cried out apparently indignantly:</p>
               <p>"An' is it sillin' the head of your fellow-crature, ye are! The saints betime us,
                  ye'll niver have anythin' but bad cess all your life!"</p>
               <p>The bidding had run up to three-and-sixty dollars. Down fell the hammer, and
                  that's the price the head went for. Here comes the singular part. Not long
                  afterwards, Harrison committed suicide. The buyer, a gunsmith, known as "Natchez,"
                  was accidentally killed in showing a loaded pistol to a customer.</p>
               <p>Such is the story of the most famous bandit that the world ancient or modern ever
                  had its records stained with. In tracing it through authentic sources, documents
                  and the newspapers which pioneered the literary prides of the present days of
                  Altas, Golden Ages, Mercuries, etc., etc., perhaps we have colored the facts a
                  little vividly, but we have not inserted an account of one homicide which was not
                  true. And in rounding off our pages relative to the dark days of the "Golden
                  Land," let us express our wish that she may increase in all freshness and beauty,
                  and riches, and that she will continue evermore on her peaceful path, the frown
                  replaced by a smile of happiness, her robes no more trailed in blood and earth,
                  but radiant with purest gold and purest silver, brighter than the intelligence of
                  her sons, pure as her daughters' hearts!</p>
